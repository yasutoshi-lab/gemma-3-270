{"id": "4047735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral%20district%20of%20Northern%20Tablelands", "title": "Electoral district of Northern Tablelands", "text": "Northern Tablelands is an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of New South Wales. It is currently held by Adam Marshall representing the National Party, following a by-election triggered by the resignation of independent member Richard Torbay. The electorate currently includes Uralla Shire, Armidale Regional Council, Glen Innes Severn, Inverell Shire, Gwydir Shire and Moree Plains Shire.\n\nHistory\nNorthern Tablelands was originally created in 1920, with the introduction of proportional representation, replacing Armidale, Gough and Tenterfield, and elected three members. It was held by the same three members throughout its first incarnation: inaugural Country Party leader Michael Bruxner, state Minister for Education David Drummond, and Labor MP Alfred McClelland, grandfather of former federal Attorney-General Robert McClelland. In 1927, it was divided into the single-member electorates of Armidale and Tenterfield.  It was recreated in 1981, partly replacing Armidale and Tenterfield.\n\nOn its recreation in 1981, the seat was a notional  seat. However, Labor's Bill McCarthy, who had won Armidale in the \"Wranslide\" of 1978, won the merged seat in the second \"Wranslide.\" McCarthy held the seat for Labor against aggressive National Country/National opposition even as this already conservative area became even more so. He was only the second Labor member to represent much of the area in the single-member era, and most of the seat was served by the safe federal National seat of New England.\n\nMcCarthy had developed serious health problems by the 1984 state election, but was persuaded to recontest to maintain Labor control of the seat. He resigned in 1987 when it was apparent he could not continue, and died soon afterward. Labor endorsed McCarthy's widow, Thelma, at the subsequent by-election, but she was narrowly defeated by National candidate Ray Chappell after a heavily-publicised campaign. The seat's conservative nature reasserted itself, and Chappell was re-elected with little difficulty three times. However, in the 1999 election, Chappell faced a challenge from the popular ex-mayor of Armidale, Richard Torbay, standing as an independent. In a shock result, Torbay won the seat with a comfortable margin—the latest case of NSW country areas rejecting the Nationals in favour of local independents.\n\nTorbay was comfortably reelected in 2003, 2007, and 2011, each time taking well over 60 percent of the two-party vote and easily winning enough primary votes to retain the seat outright. He served as Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 2007 to 2011, during what proved to be the final term of Labor's 16-year run in government. He was the first independent to hold that post since 1917. As a measure of his popularity, he suffered a swing of nearly 11 percent in 2011 amid the massive Coalition wave that swept through NSW, but still retained his seat with a comfortable majority of 19.2 percent.\n\nTorbay was forced out of politics in 2013 amid a corruption investigation. At the ensuing by-election, Adam Marshall easily reclaimed the seat for the Nationals. This was not considered an upset, as Northern Tablelands had been a comfortably safe National seat in \"traditional\" two-party matchups with Labor for most of Torbay's tenure. The Nationals would have won it two years earlier with a majority of 26.1 percent in a \"traditional\" two-party matchup with Labor. Marshall has held the seat without serious difficulty since, and now sits on a majority of 32.8 percent, the safest in the state.\n\nFrom 1999, Northern Tablelands covered 30,546 km2, including the uplands of northern New South Wales. It centred on the university city of Armidale; other towns included in the electorate are Inverell, Glen Innes, Tenterfield and Uralla. The northern boundary of the electorate is the Queensland border. At the 2003 election, there were 42,886 enrolled voters.\n\nIn 2007, the low level of population growth in the electorate led to Northern Tablelands being expanded, both to the west to take in Warialda and Bingara and to the south to take in Walcha and Nowendoc, increasing its area to 44,674 km2.\n\nThe redistribution ahead of the 2015 state election saw Northern Tablelands expanded again to 53,153.76 square kilometres. Added to the district was the entirety of Moree Plains Shire  along with the remainder of the former Armidale Dumaresq Shire, whilst Tenterfield Shire was removed from the district.\n\nWhile Labor frequently runs dead in northern NSW, Northern Tablelands has become particularly unfriendly territory for Labor even by northern NSW standards. Labor has never come reasonably close to retaking the seat since McCarthy's death. For example, Chappell was reelected in 1995 with a primary vote large enough to win outright even as the Coalition was defeated. Since the turn of the millennium, Labor has been lucky to get more than 20 percent of the two-party vote, and has even been pushed into third place on some occasions.\n\nMembers\n\nElection results\n\nReferences\n\nNorthern Tablelands\nNorthern Tablelands\nElectoral District of Northern Tablelands\nNorthern Tablelands\nElectoral District of Northern Tablelands\nNorthern Tablelands\nElectoral District of Northern Tablelands\nNew England (New South Wales)\nNorthern Tablelands"}

It was abolished in 1927 and replaced by Lane Cove, Manly, Mosman, Neutral Bay, North Sydney and Willoughby.

It is represented since the 2014 Newcastle by-election by Tim Crakanthorp of the Australian Labor Party.\n\nThe district takes in the eastern part of the City of Newcastle, including the parts of the suburbs from Hexham to Mayfield lying to the east of the Main North railway line, Broadmeadow, Hamilton South, Merewether Heights and Merewether and the suburbs further east, including central Newcastle and Hamilton. It also includes the Port Stephens Council suburbs of Fern Bay and Fullerton Cove.\n\nHistory\nNewcastle was created in 1859 from part of North Eastern Boroughs. It gained a second member in 1880 and a third member in 1889. With the abolition of multi-member electorates in 1894, it was divided into Newcastle East, Newcastle West, Kahibah, Waratah and Wickham. These changes to the electoral boundaries were debated. Newcastle was re-created in the 1904 re-distribution of electorates following the 1903 New South Wales referendum, which required the number of members of the Legislative Assembly to be reduced from 125 to 90. It consisted of Newcastle East and part of Newcastle West. With the introduction of proportional representation in 1920, it absorbed Kahibah, Wallsend and Wickham and elected five members. With the end of proportional representation in 1927, Newcastle was split into the single-member electorates of Newcastle, Hamilton, Kahibah and Wallsend.\n\nIt has since been usually held by the Labor Party. This pattern was threatened in early 2007, when sitting member Bryce Gaudry lost his preselection to a former local newsreader, Jodi McKay. Gaudry opted to stand as an independent and as a consequence split the Labor Party's vote. Independent former Lord Mayor of Newcastle John Tate came close to winning the seat after preferences but McKay managed to hold on. Labor's previous margin of over 15% had been slashed to as little as 1.4%, making it one of Labor's most marginal seats.\n\nAt the 2011 New South Wales state election, Liberal Tim Owen defeated incumbent and one-term member McKay and popular Independent Tate, marking the first time the Liberals or their predecessors had won Newcastle as a single-member seat in over a century. This was one of many gains the Liberals made in what was previously Labor heartland.\n\nOwen became an independent and moved to the crossbench on 6 August 2014 after accusations at the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). He resigned from parliament on 12 August 2014 after evidence of corruption was uncovered. The Liberals opted not to contest the ensuing by-election, which saw Labor's Tim Crakanthorp reclaim the seat handily.\n\nMembers for Newcastle\n\nElection results\n\nReferences\n\nNewcastle\nPolitics of Newcastle, New South Wales\n1859 establishments in Australia\nNewcastle\n1894 disestablishments in Australia\nNewcastle\n1904 establishments in Australia\nNewcastle"}

He has appeared in several films, stage, and television productions. Fagbenle is best known for his role as Luke in The Handmaid’s Tale (2017–2022), for which he received an Emmy nomination, and his portrayal of Barack Obama in The First Lady (2022).\n\nEarly life\nBorn in London to a Yoruba Nigerian father, journalist Tunde Fagbenle, and a White British/English mother, Ally Bedford, Fagbenle was raised by his mother and lived in Nigeria, Spain, and the UK as a child. He started learning the alto saxophone and within a year joined the South Coast Jazz Band, which toured the Edinburgh Festival. In the UK he performed as a musician in big bands at the Wembley Arena and the Royal Albert Hall.\n\nHis name \"Olatunde\" means literally \"Honour returns\" or \"Honour is restored\" in Yoruba. This may be in the abstract or literal sense. His last name, Fagbenle, or \"Fágbénlé\" in Yoruba, means \"Ifa [the Yoruba oracle] makes me triumph,\" indicating that Fagbenle's paternal ancestors were worshippers of the Ifa religion. His middle name, Olateju means, \"honor is clear,\"  and his other middle name, \"Olaolorun,\" means \"the wealth/honor of God.\"\n\nHis younger brothers include actor and film producer Luti Fagbenle, and video director and producer Daps. His sister is a WNBA player and Olympian Temi Fagbenle.\n\nActing career\n\nTheatre\nHe started acting at the age of 14 for the Ritual Theatre Arts and was given the lead role in an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth, performing at international venues and at central London's Bloomsbury Theatre. He trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and graduated early to make his graduate debut at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester in Les Blancs in 2001. Fagbenle originated the role of \"Perry\" in the Royal Court's production of the award-winning production of Fallout.\n\nFagbenle continued his Shakespearean roles by performing in Romeo and Juliet as Mercutio in a national tour culminating at the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 2004. The Evening Telegraph said of his performance, \"O-T Fagbenle achieves the impossible by almost overshadowing the young lovers with his inspired performance of Mercutio\".\n\nFagbenle was soon offered his first all-out lead. Outstanding reviews preceded a M.E.N. Theatre Award for best actor in a leading role for his portrayal of a man claiming to be Sidney Poitier's son in John Guare's award-winning play Six Degrees of Separation.\n\nIn 2008, Fagbenle flew to Paris with the theatre director Peter Brook to help workshop and develop Brook's international production of Tierno Bokar.\n\nAfter John W. Bubbles in the original opera and Sammy Davis Jr. in the film, Fagbenle played the role of Sportin' Life in Sir Trevor Nunn's production of Porgy and Bess - The Musical at the Savoy Theatre in the West End of London. Fagbenle received outstanding reviews. Variety magazine's review remarked 'There are moments everything takes wing as a musical, mostly whenever Fagbenle's splendidly serpentine, easeful Sportin' Life is around. Light on his feet, his every moment is poised and polished.'\n\nIn 2012 in London, England, Fagbenle took on the role of Slupianek in The Conquest of the South Pole at the Arcola and Rose Theatres.

{"id": "4047804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern%20Ireland%20flags%20issue", "title": "Northern Ireland flags issue", "text": "The Northern Ireland flags issue is one that divides the population along sectarian lines. Depending on political allegiance, people identify with differing flags and symbols, some of which have, or have had, official status in Northern Ireland.\n\nCommon flags\n\nThe flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack or Union Flag, is the only flag routinely used officially by the sovereign UK government, as well as being flown on most council buildings in Northern Ireland. The Union Flag is often flown by unionists but is disliked by nationalists. British law states that the Union Flag must be flown on designated days from central government buildings in Northern Ireland.\nThe Ulster Banner, the flag of the pre-1973 government of Northern Ireland, was used from 1953 to 1972 by the Stormont government to represent the government of Northern Ireland. That government was granted a royal warrant to fly the Ulster Banner in 1924, but this expired when the government was dissolved under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. It continues to be used by some sports teams representing Northern Ireland internationally, for example by the Northern Ireland football team, and by the Northern Ireland Commonwealth Games team.\nThe flag of Ireland or Irish tricolour is the state flag of the Republic of Ireland, disliked by Unionists and is regarded by republicans and nationalists as the flag of all of Ireland.\nThe Saint Patrick's Saltire represents Northern Ireland indirectly as Ireland in the Union Jack. It is sometimes flown during Saint Patrick's Day parades in Northern Ireland, and is used to represent Northern Ireland during some royal events.\nOther flags flown by socialist republicans include the Starry Plough, the Sunburst flag and even the flag of the Ulster province. Loyalists sometimes display the flag of Scotland as a sign of their Scottish ancestry. Ulster nationalists use the unofficial 'Ulster Nation flag', although it has now been adopted as an Ulster-Scots flag.\n\nControversies\nThe Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954 prohibited the display of any flag which was \"likely to cause a breach of public order\", and gave the police powers to deal with it. However, it specifically excluded the Union Jack from its provisions. In 1956, the Stormont Minister of Affairs, George Hanna, banned an Irish Nationalist cultural demonstration planned for the annual Feis at Newtownbutler, County Fermanagh. The march proceeded anyway, and in response the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) launched a baton charge to seize a banner depicting Patrick Pearse but were unsuccessful. Police attempted a second baton charge which also failed and then resorted to using fire hoses against the crowds. Several people were injured during the disturbances, at least one seriously. The RUC had removed three Irish tricolours from the home of a parish priest during the previous year's Feis. In 1964, the RUC moved in to remove an Irish tricolour from the window of an office in Belfast, after Ian Paisley had publicly said that if they did not, he would do so personally. This resulted in serious rioting. The Act was repealed in 1987.\n\nIn some loyalist areas, the flying of flags supporting loyalist paramilitaries has proved controversial. Groups like the Ulster Defence Association, Ulster Volunteer Force, Young Citizen Volunteers, Red Hand Commando, and Loyalist Volunteer Force all have their own unique flags and although these flags usually appear alongside murals, they can occasionally be seen flying from lampposts in villages and towns or flying from houses in the run-up to the Twelfth.\n\nAfter the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, flags continue to be a source of disagreement in Northern Ireland. The Agreement states that:\n\nSome local councils have debated the usage of the Tricolour. In 2002 Belfast City Council displayed the Tricolour along with the Union Flag in the Lord Mayor's parlour during the term of Sinn Féin Lord Mayor Alex Maskey. A different approach was taken in 1997; when the Social Democratic and Labour Party's (SDLP) Alban Maginness was Lord Mayor, neither flag was displayed. In September 2003, Belfast City Council discussed flying the Tricolour alongside the Union Flag on designated occasions.\n\nIn June 2007 the designated nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party complained about an artist's rendering of IKEA Belfast that included both the Union Flag and the Ulster Banner flag as two of the three flags in front of the store. After being labelled \"an upmarket Orange hall\" by the party, IKEA assured customers and co-workers that only the Swedish flag would be seen outside the actual store.\n\nThe Ulster Banner continued to be used by some local governments, such as the predominantly unionist Castlereagh, which flew it outside its offices.\n\nA decision in December 2012 to fly the Union flag over Belfast City Hall only on certain designated days, instead of all the year round as previously, led to the Belfast City Hall flag protests, which included riots in which police officers were injured.\n\nThe Northern Ireland flags controversy has led to Unicode being unable to release an equivalent country emoji for Northern Ireland, as it has for Scotland, England, and Wales.\n\nFlag proposals\n\nHaass talks\nIn 2013, US diplomat Richard Haass chaired talks between the political parties in Northern Ireland dealing with, among other things, the issue of flags. The resulting draft proposals, which were not agreed to by the parties, included the idea of a new flag for Northern Ireland, and the possibility of a \"circumscribed role for the sovereign flag of Ireland in conjunction with the Union flag.\"\n\nProposed \"Civic Flag\"\nIn December 2021, the Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition (FICT) published its final report which included a recommendation that a new \"Civic Flag for Northern Ireland\" should be adopted and be flown at buildings of the Northern Ireland Executive, Northern Ireland Assembly and local district councils in Northern Ireland. The commissions suggested that the design for the new flag should incorporate expressions of Britishness and Irishness and should also represent the diversity of the community in Northern Ireland.\n\nSee also\n Flag of Northern Ireland\n List of flags of the Republic of Ireland\n List of flags of the United Kingdom\n List of flags used in Northern Ireland\n Cross-border flag for Ireland\n Party Processions Act 1850 Act which banned \"any Banner, Emblem, Flag or Symbol, the Display whereof may be calculated or tend to provoke Animosity between different Classes of Her Majesty's Subjects\"\n Kerb painting\n Coat of arms of Northern Ireland\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Symbols in Northern Ireland - Flags Used in the Region by Dara Mulhern and Martin Melaugh; illustrated article from CAIN Project (Conflict Archive on the INternet)\n\nIssue\nFlag controversies\nSectarianism"}

{"id": "4047822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R10000", "title": "R10000", "text": "The R10000, code-named \"T5\", is a RISC microprocessor implementation of the MIPS IV instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Technologies, Inc. (MTI), then a division of Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). The chief designers are Chris Rowen and Kenneth C. Yeager. The R10000 microarchitecture is known as ANDES, an abbreviation for Architecture with Non-sequential Dynamic Execution Scheduling. The R10000 largely replaces the R8000 in the high-end and the R4400 elsewhere. MTI was a fabless semiconductor company; the R10000 was fabricated by NEC and Toshiba. Previous fabricators of MIPS microprocessors such as Integrated Device Technology (IDT) and three others did not fabricate the R10000 as it was more expensive to do so than the R4000 and R4400.\n\nHistory \n\nThe R10000 was introduced in January 1996 at clock frequencies of 175 MHz and 195 MHz. A 150 MHz version was introduced in the O2 product line in 1997, but discontinued shortly after due to customer preference for the 175 MHz version. The R10000 was not available in large volumes until later in the year due to fabrication problems at MIPS's foundries. The 195 MHz version was in short supply throughout 1996, and was priced at US$3,000 as a result.\n\nOn 25 September 1996, SGI announced that R10000s fabricated by NEC between March and the end of July that year were faulty, drawing too much current and causing systems to shut down during operation. SGI recalled 10,000 R10000s that had shipped in systems as a result, which impacted the company's earnings.\n\nIn 1997, a version of R10000 fabricated in a 0.25 µm process enabled the microprocessor to reach 250 MHz.\n\nUsers\nUsers of the R10000 include:\n SGI:\n Workstations: Indigo2 (IMPACT Generation), Octane, O2\n Servers: Challenge, Origin 2000\n Supercomputers: Onyx, Onyx2\n NEC, in its Cenju-4 supercomputer\n Siemens Nixdorf, in its servers run under SINIX\n Tandem Computers, in its Himalaya fault-tolerant servers\n\nDescription \n\nThe R10000 is a four-way superscalar design that implements register renaming and executes instructions out-of-order. Its design is a departure from previous MTI microprocessors such as the R4000, which is a much simpler scalar in-order design that relies largely on high clock rates for performance.\n\nThe R10000 fetches four instructions every cycle from its instruction cache. These instructions are decoded and then placed into the integer, floating-point or load/store instruction queues depending on the type of the instruction. The decode unit is assisted by the pre-decoded instructions from the instruction cache, which append five bits to every instruction to enable the unit to quickly identify which execution unit the instruction is executed in, and rearrange the format of the instruction to optimize the decode process.\n\nEach of the instruction queues can accept up to four instructions from the decoder, avoiding any bottlenecks. The instruction queues issue their instructions to their execution units dynamically depending on the availability of operands and resources. Each of the queues except for the load/store queue can issue up to two instructions every cycle to its execution units. The load/store queue can only issue one instruction. The R10000 can thus issue up to five instructions every cycle.\n\nInteger unit\nThe integer unit consists of the integer register file and three pipelines, two integer, one load store. The integer register file is 64 bits wide and contains 64 entries, of which 32 are architectural registers and 32 are rename registers which implement register renaming. The register file has seven read ports and three write ports. Both integer pipelines have an adder and a logic unit. However, only the first pipeline has a barrel shifter and hardware for confirming the prediction of conditional branches. The second pipeline is used to access the multiplier and divider. Multiplies are pipelined, and have a six-cycle latency for 32-bit integers and ten for 64-bit integers. Division is not pipelined. The divider uses a non-restoring algorithm that produces one bit per cycle. Latencies for 32-bit and 64-bit divides are 35 and 67 cycles, respectively.\n\nFloating-point unit\nThe floating-point unit (FPU) consists of four functional units, an adder, a multiplier, divide unit and square root unit. The adder and multiplier are pipelined, but the divide and square root units are not. Adds and multiplies have a latency of three cycles and the adder and multiplier can accept a new instruction every cycle. The divide unit has a 12- or 19-cycle latency, depending on whether the divide is single precision or double precision, respectively.\n\nThe square root unit executes square root and reciprocal square root instructions. Square root instructions have an 18- or 33-cycle latency for single precision or double precision, respectively. A new square root instruction can be issued to the divide unit every 20 or 35 cycles for single precision and double precision respectively. Reciprocal square roots have longer latencies, 30 to 52 cycles for single precision (32-bit) and double precision (64-bit) respectively.\n\nThe floating-point register file contains sixty-four 64-bit registers, of which thirty-two are architectural and the remaining are rename registers.\nThe adder has its own dedicated read and write ports, whereas the multiplier shares its with the divider and square root unit.\n\nThe divide and square root units use the SRT algorithm. The MIPS IV ISA has a multiply–add instruction. This instruction is implemented by the R10000 with a bypass — the result of the multiply can bypass the register file and be delivered to the add pipeline as an operand, thus it is not a fused multiply–add, and has a four-cycle latency.\n\nCaches\nThe R10000 has two comparatively large on-chip caches, a 32 KB instruction cache and a 32 KB data cache. The instruction cache is two-way set-associative and has a 128-byte line size. Instructions are partially decoded by appending four bits to each instruction (which have a length of 32 bits) before they are placed in the cache.\n\nThe 32 KB data cache is dual-ported through two-way interleaving. It consists of two 16 KB banks, and each bank are two-way set-associative. The cache has 64-byte lines, uses the write-back protocol, and is virtually indexed and physically tagged to enable the cache to be indexed in the same clock cycle and to maintain coherency with the secondary cache.\n\nThe external secondary unified cache supported capacities between 512 KB and 16 MB. It is implemented with commodity synchronous static random access memorys (SSRAMs). The cache is accessed via its own 128-bit bus that is protected by 9-bits of error correcting code (ECC). The cache and bus operate at the same clock rate as the R10000, whose maximum frequency was 200 MHz. At 200 MHz, the bus yielded a peak bandwidth of 3.2 GB/s. The cache is two-way set associative, but to avoid a high pin count, the R10000 predicts which way is accessed.\n\nAddressing\nMIPS IV is a 64-bit architecture, but to reduce cost the R10000 does not implement the entire physical or virtual address. Instead, it has a 40-bit physical address and a 44-bit virtual address, thus it is capable of addressing 1 TB of physical memory and 16 TB of virtual memory.\n\nAvalanche system bus\nThe R10000 uses the Avalanche bus, a 64-bit bus that operates at frequencies up to 100 MHz. Avalanche is a multiplexed address and data bus, so at 100 MHz it yields a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 800 MB/s, but its peak bandwidth is 640 MB/s as it requires some cycles to transmit addresses.\n\nThe system interface controller supports glue-less symmetrical multiprocessing (SMP) of up to four microprocessors. Systems using the R10000 with external logic can scale to hundreds of processors. An example of such a system is the Origin 2000.\n\nFabrication\nThe R10000 consists of approximately 6.8 million transistors, of which approximately 4.4 million are contained in the primary caches. The die measures 16.640 by 17.934 mm, for a die area of 298.422 mm2. It is fabricated in a 0.35 µm process and packaged in 599-pad ceramic land grid array (LGA). Before the R10000 was introduced, the Microprocessor Report, covering the 1994 Microprocessor Forum, reported that it was packaged in a 527-pin ceramic pin grid array (CPGA); and that vendors also investigated the possibility of using a 339-pin multi-chip module (MCM) containing the microprocessor die and 1 MB of cache.\n\nDerivatives \nThe R10000 was extended by multiple successive derivatives. All derivatives after the R12000 have their clock frequency kept as low as possible to maintain power dissipation in the 15 to 20 W range so they can be densely packaged in SGI's high performance computing (HPC) systems.\n\nR12000 \n\nThe R12000 is a derivative of the R10000 started by MIPS and completed by SGI. It was fabricated by NEC and Toshiba. The version fabricated by NEC is called the VR12000. The microprocessor was introduced in November 1998. It is available at 270, 300 and 360 MHz. The R12000 was developed as a stop-gap solution following the cancellation of the \"Beast\" project, which intended to deliver a successor to the R10000. R12000 users include NEC, Siemens-Nixdorf, SGI and Tandem Computers (and later Compaq, after their acquisition of Tandem).\n\nThe R12000 improves upon the R10000 microarchitecture by: inserting an extra pipeline stage to improve clock frequency by resolving a critical path; increasing the number of entries in the branch history table, improving prediction; modifying the instruction queues so they take into account the age of a queued instruction, enabling older instructions to be executed before newer ones if possible.\n\nThe R12000 was fabricated by NEC and Toshiba in a 0.25 µm CMOS process with four levels of aluminum interconnect. The use of a new process does not mean that the R12000 was a simple die shrink with a tweaked microarchitecture; the layout of the die is optimized to take advantage of the 0.25 µm process. The NEC fabricated VR12000 contained 7.15 million transistors and measured 15.7 by 14.6 mm (229.22 mm2).\n\nR12000A \nThe R12000A is a derivative of the R12000 developed by SGI. Introduced in July 2000, it operates at 400 MHz and was fabricated by NEC a 0.18 µm process with aluminum interconnects.\n\nR14000 \nThe R14000 is a further development of the R12000 announced in July 2001. The R14000 operates at 500 MHz, enabled by the 0.13 µm CMOS process with five levels of copper interconnect it is fabricated with. It features improvements to the microarchitecture of the R12000 by supporting double data rate (DDR) SSRAMs for the secondary cache and a 200 MHz system bus.\n\nR14000A \n\nThe R14000A is a further development of the R14000 announced in February 2002. It operates at 600 MHz, dissipates approximately 17 W, and was fabricated by NEC Corporation in a 0.13 µm CMOS process with seven levels of copper interconnect.\n\nR16000 \n\nThe R16000, code-named \"N0\", is the last derivative of the R10000. It is developed by SGI and fabricated by NEC in their 0.11 µm process with eight levels of copper interconnect. The microprocessor was introduced on 9 January 2003, debuting at 700 MHz for the Fuel and also used in their Onyx4 Ultimate Vision. In April 2003, a 600 MHz version was introduced for the Origin 350. Improvements are 64 KB instruction and data caches.\n\nR16000A \n\nThe R16000A refers to R16000 microprocessors with clock rates higher than 700 MHz. The first R16000A is an 800 MHz version, introduced on 4 February 2004. Later, a 900 MHz version was introduced, and this version was, for some time, the fastest publicly known R16000A—SGI later revealed there were 1.0 GHz R16000s shipped to selected customers. R16000 users included HP and SGI. SGI used the microprocessor in their Fuel and Tezro workstations; and the Origin 3000 servers and supercomputers. HP used the R16000A in their NonStop Himalaya S-Series fault-tolerant servers inherited from Tandem via Compaq.\n\nR18000 \n\nThe R18000 is a canceled further development of the R10000 microarchitecture that featured major improvements by Silicon Graphics, Inc. described at the Hot Chips symposium in 2001. The R18000 was designed specifically for SGI's ccNUMA servers and supercomputers. Each node would have two R18000s connected via a multiplexed bus to a system controller, which would interface the microprocessors to their local memory and the rest of the system via a hypercube network.\n\nThe R18000 improved the floating-point instruction queues and revised the floating-point unit to feature two multiply–add units, quadrupling the peak FLOPS count. Division and square-root would be performed in separate non-pipelined units in parallel to the multiply–add units. The system interface and memory hierarchy was also significantly reworked. It would have a 52-bit virtual address and a 48-bit physical address. The bidirectional multiplexed address and data system bus of the earlier models would be replaced by two unidirectional DDR links, a 64-bit multiplexed address and write path and a 128-bit read path. The paths could be shared with another R18000 through multiplexing. The bus could also be configured in the SysAD or Avalanche configuration for backwards compatibility with R10000 systems.\n\nThe R18000 would have a 1 MB four-way set-associative secondary cache to be included on-die; supplemented by an optional tertiary cache built from single data rate (SDR) or double data rate (DDR) SSRAM or DDR SDRAM with capacities of 2 to 64 MB. The L3 cache would have its cache tags, equivalent to 400 KB, located on-die to reduce latency. The L3 cache would be accessed via a 144-bit bus, of which 128 bits are for data and 16 bits for ECC. The L3 cache's clock rate would be programmable.\n\nThe R18000 was to be fabricated in NEC's UX5 process, a 0.13 µm CMOS process with nine levels of copper interconnect. It would have used 1.2 V power supply and dissipated less heat than contemporary server microprocessors in order to be densely packed into systems.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Fu, Tim et al.

Introduced in June 1988, it was the second MIPS implementation, succeeding the R2000 as the flagship MIPS microprocessor. It operated at 20, 25 and 33.33 MHz.\n\nThe MIPS 1 instruction set is small compared to those of the contemporary 80x86 and 680x0 architectures, encoding only more commonly used operations and supporting few addressing modes. Combined with its fixed instruction length and only three different types of instruction formats, this simplified instruction decoding and processing. It employed a 5-stage instruction pipeline, enabling execution at a rate approaching one instruction per cycle, unusual for its time.\n\nThis MIPS generation supports up to four co-processors. In addition to the CPU core, the R3000 microprocessor includes a Control Processor (CP), which contains a Translation Lookaside Buffer and a Memory Management Unit. The CP works as a coprocessor. Besides the CP, the R3000 can also support an external R3010 numeric coprocessor, along with two other external coprocessors.\n\nThe R3000 CPU does not include level 1 cache. Instead, its on-chip cache controller operates external data and instruction caches of up to 256 KB each. It can access both caches during the same clock cycle.\n\nThe R3000 found much success and was used by many companies in their workstations and servers. Users included:\n Ardent Computer\n Atari COJAG (A modified Atari Jaguar for arcade systems).\n Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for their DECstation workstations and multiprocessor DECsystem servers.\n Evans & Sutherland for their Vision (ESV) series workstations.\n LSI Logic for their CW4003 RISC processor core and DCAM-101 system-on-a-chip.\n MIPS Computer Systems for their MIPS RISC/os Unix workstations and servers.\n NEC for their RISC EWS4800 workstations and UP4800 servers.\n Prime Computer\n Pyramid Technology\n Seiko Epson\n Silicon Graphics for their Professional IRIS, Personal IRIS and Indigo workstations, and the multiprocessor Power Series visualization systems.\n Sony for their PlayStation and PlayStation 2 (SCPH-10000 to SCPH-700XX - clocked at 37.5 MHz for use as an I/O CPU and at 33.8 MHz for compatibility with PlayStation games) video game consoles, and NEWS workstations, as well as the Bemani System 573 Analog arcade unit, which runs on the R3000A.\n Tandem Computers for their NonStop Cyclone/R and CLX/R fault-tolerant servers.\n Whitechapel Workstations for their Hitech-20 workstation.\n New Horizons Probe \n\nThe R3000 was also used as an embedded microprocessor. When advances in technology rendered it obsolete for high-performance systems, it found continued use in lower-cost designs. Companies such as LSI Logic developed derivatives of the R3000 specifically for embedded systems.\n\nThe R3000 was a further development of the R2000 with minor improvements including larger TLB and a faster bus to the external caches. The R3000 die contained 115,000 transistors and measured about 75,000 square mils (48 mm2). MIPS was a fabless semiconductor company, so the R3000 was fabricated by MIPS partners including Integrated Device Technology (IDT), LSI Logic, NEC Corporation, Performance Semiconductor, and others. It was fabricated in a 1.2 μm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process with two levels of aluminium interconnect.\n\nDerivatives of the R3000 for non-embedded applications include:\n R3000A - A further development by MIPS introduced in 1989. It operated at clock frequencies up to 40 MHz.\n PR3400 - Developed by Performance Semiconductor, introduced in May 1991, also at up to 40 MHz. It integrated the Performance Semiconductor PR3000A and PR3010A onto a single die.\n\nDerivatives of the R3000 for embedded applications include:\n CW4003, DCAM-101 - Aimed at digital camera applications, the CW4003 core featured a \"multiplier-addition bolt-on\" (MABO) unit for accelerated integer arithmetic and a pixel-processing accelerator (PPA) unit accessible via the coprocessor 2 interface. The DCAM-101 combined the CW4003 core with modules interfacing to a camera sensor, display, storage and other peripherals, also incorporating a JPEG compression/decompression unit.\n PR31500, PR31700 - Microprocessors from Philips Semiconductors used in the Philips Velo handheld PC range.

{"id": "4047829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R4000", "title": "R4000", "text": "The R4000 is a microprocessor developed by MIPS Computer Systems that implements the MIPS III instruction set architecture (ISA). Officially announced on 1 October 1991, it was one of the first 64-bit microprocessors and the first MIPS III implementation. In the early 1990s, when RISC microprocessors were expected to replace CISC microprocessors such as the Intel i486, the R4000 was selected to be the microprocessor of the Advanced Computing Environment (ACE), an industry standard that intended to define a common RISC platform. ACE ultimately failed for a number of reasons, but the R4000 found success in the workstation and server markets.\n\nModels \nThere are three configurations of the R4000: the R4000PC, an entry-level model with no support for a secondary cache; the R4000SC, a model with secondary cache but no multiprocessor capability; and the R4000MC, a model with secondary cache and support for the cache coherency protocols required by multiprocessor systems.\n\nDescription \nThe R4000 is a scalar superpipelined microprocessor with an eight-stage integer pipeline. During the first stage (IF), a virtual address for an instruction is generated and the instruction translation lookaside buffer (TLB) begins the translation of the address to a physical address. In the second stage (IS), translation is completed and the instruction is fetched from an internal 8 KB instruction cache. The instruction cache is direct-mapped and virtually indexed, physically tagged. It has a 16- or 32-byte line size. Architecturally, it could be expanded to 32 KB.\n\nDuring the third stage (RF), the instruction is decoded and the register file is read. The MIPS III defines two register files, one for the integer unit and the other for floating-point. Each register file is 64 bits wide and contained 32 entries. The integer register file has two read ports and one write port, while the floating-point register file has two read ports and two write ports. Execution begins at stage four (EX) for both integer and floating-point instructions; and is written back to the register files when completed in stage eight (WB). Results may be bypassed if possible.\n\nInteger execution \nThe R4000 has an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), a shifter, multiplier and divider and load aligner for executing integer instructions. The ALU consists of a 64-bit carry-select adder and a logic unit and is pipelined. The shifter is a 32-bit barrel shifter. It performs 64-bit shifts in two cycles, stalling the pipeline as a result. This design was chosen to save die area. The multiplier and divider are not pipelined and have significant latencies: multiplies have a 10- or 20-cycle latency for 32-bit or 64-bit integers, respectively; whereas divides have a 69- or 133-cycle latency for 32-bit or 64-bit integers, respectively. Most instructions have a single cycle latency. The ALU adder is also used for calculating virtual addresses for loads, stores and branches.\n\nLoad and store instructions are executed by the integer pipeline, and access the on-chip 8 KB data cache.\n\nFloating-point execution \nThe R4000 has an on-die IEEE 754-1985-compliant floating-point unit (FPU), referred to as the R4010. The FPU is a coprocessor designated CP1 (the MIPS ISA defined four coprocessors, designated CP0 to CP3). The FPU can operate in two modes, 32- or 64-bit which are selected by setting a bit, the FR bit, in the CPU status register. In 32-bit mode, the 32 floating-point registers become 32 bits wide when used to hold single-precision floating-point numbers. When used to hold double-precision numbers, there are 16 floating-point registers (the registers are paired).\n\nThe FPU can operate in parallel with the ALU unless there is a data or resource dependency, which causes it to stall. It contains three sub-units: an adder, a multiplier and a divider. The multiplier and divider can execute an instruction in parallel with the adder, but they use the adder in their final stages of execution, thus imposing limits to overlapping execution. Thus, under certain conditions, it can execute up to three instructions at any time, one in each unit. The FPU is capable of retiring one instruction per cycle.\n\nThe adder and multiplier are pipelined. The multiplier has a four-stage multiplier pipeline. It is clocked at twice the clock frequency of the microprocessor for adequate performance and uses dynamic logic to achieve the high clock frequency. Division has a 23- or 36-cycle latency for single- or double-precision operations and square-root has a 54- or 112-cycle latency. Division and square-root uses the SRT algorithm.\n\nMemory management \nThe memory management unit (MMU) uses a 48-entry translation lookaside buffer to translate virtual addresses. The R4000 uses a 64-bit virtual address, but only implements 40 of the 64 bits, allowing 1 TB of virtual memory; the remaining bits are checked to ensure that they contain zero. The R4000 uses a 36-bit physical address, thus is able to address 64 GB of physical memory.\n\nSecondary cache \nThe R4000 (SC and MC configurations only) supports an external secondary cache with a capacity of 128 KB to 4 MB. The cache is accessed via a dedicated 128-bit data bus. The secondary cache can be configured either as a unified cache or as a split instruction and data cache. In the latter configuration, each cache can have a capacity of 128 KB to 2 MB. The secondary cache is physically indexed, physically tagged and has a programmable line size of 128, 256, 512 or 1,024 bytes. The cache controller is on-die. The cache is built from standard static random access memory (SRAM). The data and tag buses are ECC-protected.\n\nSystem bus \nThe R4000 uses a 64-bit system bus called the SysAD bus. The SysAD bus was an address and data multiplexed bus, that is, it used the same set of wires to transfer data and addresses. While this reduces bandwidth, it is also less expensive than providing a separate address bus, which requires more pins and increases the complexity of the system.  The SysAD bus can be configured to operate at half, a third or a quarter of the internal clock frequency. The SysAD bus generates its clock signal by dividing the operating frequency.\n\nTransistor count, die dimensions and process details \nThe R4000 contains 1.2 million transistors. It was designed for a 1.0 μm two-layer metal complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process. As MIPS was a fabless company, the R4000 was fabricated by partners in their own processes, which had a 0.8 μm minimum feature size.\n\nClocking \nThe R4000 generates the various clock signals from a master clock signal generated externally. For the operating frequency, the R4000 multiplies the master clock signal by two by use of an on-die phase-locked loop (PLL).\n\nPackaging \nThe R4000PC is packaged in a 179-pin ceramic pin grid array (CPGA). The R4000SC and R4000MC are packaged in a 447-pin ceramic staggered pin grid array (SPGA). The pin out of the R4000MC is different from the R4000SC, with some pins which are unused on the R4000SC used for signals to implement cache coherency on the R4000MC. The pin-out of the R4000PC is similar to that of the PGA-packaged R4200 and R4600 microprocessors. This characteristic enables a properly designed system to use any of the three microprocessors.\n\nR4400 \n\nThe R4400 is a further development of the R4000. It was announced in early November 1992. Samples of the microprocessor had been shipped to selected customers before then, with general availability in January 1993. The R4400 operates at clock frequencies of 100, 133, 150, 200, and 250 MHz. The only major improvement from the R4000 is larger primary caches, which were doubled in capacity to 16 KB each from 8 KB each. It contained 2.3 million transistors.\n\nThe R4400 was licensed by Integrated Device Technology (IDT), LSI Logic, NEC, Performance Semiconductor, Siemens AG and Toshiba. IDT, NEC, Siemens and Toshiba fabricated and marketed the microprocessor. LSI Logic used the R4400 in custom products. Performance Semiconductor sold their logic division to Cypress Semiconductor where the MIPS microprocessor products were discontinued.\n\nNEC marketed their version as the VR4400. The first version, a 150 MHz part, was announced in November 1992. Early versions were fabricated in a 0.6 μm process. In mid-1995, a 250 MHz part began sampling. It was fabricated in a 0.35 μm four-layer-metal process. NEC also produced the MR4401, a ceramic multi-chip module (MCM) that contained a VR4400SC with ten 1 Mbit SRAM chips that implemented a 1 MB secondary cache. The MCM was pin-compatible with the R4x00PC. The first version, a 150 MHz part, was announced in 1994. In 1995, a 200 MHz part was announced.\n\nToshiba marketed their version as the TC86R4400. A 200 MHz part containing 2.3 million transistors and measuring 134 mm2 fabricated in a 0.3 μm process was introduced in mid-1994. The R4400PC was priced at , the R4400SC at , and the R4400MC at  in quantities of 10,000.\n\nUsage \nThe R4400 is used by:\n\n Carrera Computers in their Windows NT personal computers and workstations\n Concurrent Computer Corporation in their real-time multiprocessor Maxion systems\n DeskStation Technology in their Windows NT personal computers and DeskStation Tyne workstation\n Digital Equipment Corporation in their DECstation 5000/260 workstation and server\n NEC Corporation in their RISCstation workstations, RISCserver servers, and Cenju-3 supercomputer\n NeTPower in their Windows NT workstations and servers\n Pyramid Technology used the R4400MC in their Nile Series servers\n Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme (SNI) in their RM-series UNIX servers and SR2000 mainframe\n Silicon Graphics in their Onyx, Indigo, Indigo2, and Indy workstations; and in their Challenge server\n Tandem Computers in their NonStop Himalaya fault-tolerant servers\n\nChipsets \nThe R4000 and R4400 microprocessors were interfaced to the system by custom ASICs or by commercially available chipsets.

{"id": "4047831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R5000", "title": "R5000", "text": "The R5000 is a 64-bit, bi-endian, superscalar, in-order execution 2-issue design microprocessor, that implements the MIPS IV instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Quantum Effect Design (QED) in 1996. The project was funded by MIPS Technologies, Inc (MTI), also the licensor. MTI then licensed the design to Integrated Device Technology (IDT), NEC, NKK, and Toshiba. The R5000 succeeded the QED R4600 and R4700 as their flagship high-end embedded microprocessor. IDT marketed its version of the R5000 as the 79RV5000, NEC as VR5000, NKK as the NR5000, and Toshiba as the TX5000. The R5000 was sold to PMC-Sierra when the company acquired QED. Derivatives of the R5000 are still in production today for embedded systems.\n\nUsers\nUsers of the R5000 in workstation and server computers were Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) and Siemens-Nixdorf. SGI used the R5000 in their O2 and Indy low-end workstations. The R5000 was also used in embedded systems such as network routers and high-end printers. The R5000 found its way into the arcade gaming industry, R5000 powered mainboards were used by Atari and Midway. Initially the Cobalt Qube and Cobalt RaQ used a derivative model, the RM5230 and RM5231. The Qube 2700 used the RM5230 microprocessor, whereas the Qube 2 used the RM5231. The original RaQ systems were equipped with RM5230 or RM5231 CPUs but later models used AMD K6-2 chips and then eventually Intel Pentium III CPUs for the final models.\n\nHistory\nThe original roadmap called for 200 MHz operation in early 1996, 250 MHz in late 1996, succeeded in 1997 by R5000A. The R5000 was introduced in January 1996 and failed to achieve 200 MHz, topping out at 180 MHz. When positioned as a low-end workstation microprocessor, the competition included the IBM and Motorola PowerPC 604, the HP PA-7300LC and the Intel Pentium Pro.\n\nDescription\n\nThe R5000 is a two-way superscalar design that executes instructions in-order. The R5000 could simultaneously issue an integer and a floating-point instruction. It had one simple pipeline for integer instructions and another for floating-point to save transistors and die area to reduce cost. The R5000 did not perform dynamic branch prediction for cost reasons. Instead it uses a static approach, utilizing the hints encoded by the compiler in the branch-likely instructions first introduced in the MIPS II architecture to determine how likely a branch is taken.\n\nThe R5000 had large L1 caches, a distinct characteristic of QED, whose designers favored simple designs with large caches. The R5000 had two L1 caches, one for instructions and the other for data. Both have a capacity of 32 KB. The caches are two-way set-associative, have a 32-byte line size, and are virtually indexed, physically tagged. Instructions were predecoded as they enter the instruction cache by appending four bits to each instruction. These four bits specify whether can be issued together and which execution unit they are executed by. This assisted superscalar instruction issue by moving some of the dependency and conflict checking out of the critical path.\n\nThe integer unit executes most instructions with a one cycle latency and throughput except for multiply and divide. 32-bit multiplies have a five-cycle latency and a four-cycle throughput. 64-bit multiplies have an extra four cycles of latency and half the throughput. Divides have a 36-cycle latency and throughput for 32-bit integers, and for 64-bit integers, they are increased to 68 cycles.\n\nThe floating-point unit (FPU) was a fast single-precision (32-bit) design, for reduced cost and to benefit SGI, whose mid-range 3D graphics workstations relied mostly on single-precision math for 3D graphics applications. It was fully pipelined, which made it significantly better than that of the R4700. The R5000 implements the multiply-add instruction of the MIPS IV ISA. Single-precision adds, multiplies and multiply-adds have a four-cycle latency and a one cycle throughput. Single-precision divides have a 21-cycle latency and a 19-cycle throughput, while square roots have a 26-cycle latency and a 38-cycle throughput. Division and square-root was not pipelined. Instructions that operate on double precision numbers have a significantly higher latency and lower throughput except for add, which has identical latency and throughput with single-precision add. Multiply and multiply-add have a five-cycle latency and a two-cycle throughput. Divide has a 36-cycle latency and a 34-cycle throughput. Square root has a 68-cycle latency and a 66-cycle throughput.\n\nThe R5000 had an integrated L2 cache controller that supported capacities of 512 KB, 1 MB and 2 MB. The L2 cache shares the SysAD bus with the external interface. The cache was built with custom synchronous SRAMs (SSRAMs). The microprocessor uses the SysAD bus that is also used by several other MIPS microprocessors. The bus is multiplexed (address and data share the same set of wires) and can operate at clock frequencies up to 100 MHz. The initial R5000 did not support multiprocessing, but the package reserved eight pins for the future addition of this feature.\n\nQED was a fabless company and did not fabricate their own designs. The R5000 was fabricated by IDT, NEC and NKK. All three companies fabricated the R5000 in a 0.35 μm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process, but with different process features. IDT fabricated the R5000 in a process with two levels of polysilicon and three levels of aluminium interconnect. The two levels of polysilicon enabled IDT to use a four-transistor SRAM cell, resulting in a transistor count of 3.6 million and a die that measured 8.7 mm by 9.7 mm (84.39 mm2). NEC and NKK fabricated the R5000 in a process with one level of polysilicon and three levels of aluminium interconnect. Without an extra level of polysilicon, both companies had to use a six-transistor SRAM cell, resulting in a transistor count of 5.0 million and a larger die with an area of around 87 mm2. Die sizes in the range of 80 to 90 mm2 were claimed by MTI. 0.8 million of the transistors in both versions were for logic, and the remainder contained in the caches. It was packaged in a 272-ball plastic ball grid array (BGA) or 272-pin plastic pin grid array (PGA). It was not pin-compatible with any previous MIPS microprocessor.\n\nDerivatives\nIn the late 1990s, Quantum Effect Design acquired a license to manufacture and sell MIPS microprocessors from MTI and became a microprocessor vendor, changing its name to Quantum Effect Devices to reflect its new business model. The company's first products were members of the RM52xx family, which initially consisted of two models, the RM5230 and RM5260. These were announced on 24 March 1997. The RM5230 was initially available at 100 and 133 MHz, and the RM5260 at 133 and 150 MHz. On 29 September 1997, new 150 and 175 MHz RM5230s were introduced, as were 175 and 200 MHz RM5260s.\n\nBoth the RM5230 and RM5260 are derivatives of the R5000 and differ in the size of their primary caches (16 KB each instead of 32 KB), the width of their system interfaces (the RM5230 has a 32-bit 67 MHz SysAD bus, and the RM5260 a 64-bit 75 MHz SysAD bus), and the addition of multiply-add and three-operand multiply instructions for digital signal processing applications. These microprocessors were fabricated by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in its 0.35 μm process with three levels of interconnect. They were packaged by Amkor Technology in its Power-Quad 4 packages, the RM5230 in a 128-pin version, and the RM5260 in a 208-pin version.\n\nThe RM52xx family was later joined by the RM5270, which was announced at the Embedded Systems Conference on 29 September 1997. Intended for high-end embedded applications, the RM5270 was available at 150 and 200 MHz. Improvements were the addition of an on-chip secondary cache controller that supported up to 2 MB of cache. The SysAD bus is 64 bits wide and can operate at 100 MHz. It was packaged in a 304-pin Super-BGA (SBGA) that was pin-compatible with the RM7000 and was offered as a migration path to the RM7000.\n\nOn 20 July 1998, the RM52x1 family was announced. The family consisted of the RM5231, RM5261, and RM5271. These microprocessors were derivatives of the corresponding devices from the RM52x0 family fabricated in a 0.25 μm process with four levels of metal. The RM5231 was initially available at 150, 200, and 250 MHz; whereas the RM5261 and RM5271 were available at 250 and 266 MHz. On 6 July 1999, a 300 MHz RM5271 was introduced, priced at US$140 in quantities of 10,000. The RM52x1 improved upon the previous family with larger 32 KB primary caches and a faster SysAD bus that supported clock rates up to 125 MHz.\n\nAfter QED was acquired by PMC-Sierra, the RM52xx and RM52x1 families were continued as PMC-Sierra products. PMC-Sierra introduced two RM52x1 derivatives, the RM5231A and RM5261A, on 4 April 2001. These microprocessors were fabricated by TSMC in its 0.18 μm process and differ from the previous devices by featuring higher clock rates and lower power consumption. The RM5231A was available at clock rates of 250 to 350 MHz, and the RM5261A from 250 to 400 MHz.\n\nR5900 used in Sony's PlayStation 2 is a modified version of R5000 CPU dubbed the Emotion Engine with a customized instruction/data cache arrangement and Sony's proprietary 107 vector SIMD Multimedia Extensions(MMI). Its custom FPU is not IEEE 754 compliant unlike FPUs used by R5000. It also has a second MIPS core which acted as a sync controller for specialized vector coprocessors, important for 3D math which at the time was principally computed on the CPU.\n\nReferences\n\n Computergram (8 January 1996). \"MIPS Ready With R5000 Successor to the 4600/4700\".

{"id": "4047836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R8000", "title": "R8000", "text": "The R8000 is a microprocessor chipset developed by MIPS Technologies, Inc. (MTI), Toshiba, and Weitek. It was the first implementation of the MIPS IV instruction set architecture. The R8000 is also known as the TFP, for Tremendous Floating-Point, its name during development.\n\nHistory\nDevelopment of the R8000 started in the early 1990s at Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI). The R8000 was specifically designed to provide the performance of circa 1990s supercomputers with a microprocessor instead of a central processing unit (CPU) built from many discrete components such as gate arrays. At the time, the performance of traditional supercomputers was not advancing as rapidly as reduced instruction set computer (RISC) microprocessors. It was predicted that RISC microprocessors would eventually match the performance of more expensive and larger supercomputers at a fraction of the cost and size, making computers with this level of performance more accessible and enabling deskside workstations and servers to replace supercomputers in many situations.\n\nFirst details of the R8000 emerged in April 1992 in an announcement by MIPS Computer Systems detailing future MIPS microprocessors. In March 1992, SGI announced it was acquiring MIPS Computer Systems, which became a subsidiary of SGI called MIPS Technologies, Inc. (MTI) in mid-1992. Development of the R8000 was transferred to MTI, where it continued. The R8000 was expected to be introduced in 1993, but it was delayed until mid-1994. The first R8000, a 75 MHz part, was introduced on 7 June 1994. It was priced at US$2,500 at the time. In mid-1995, a 90 MHz part appeared in systems from SGI. The R8000's high cost and narrow market (technical and scientific computing) restricted its market share, and although it was popular in its intended market, it was largely replaced with the cheaper and generally better performing R10000 introduced January 1996.\n\nUsers of the R8000 were SGI, who used it in their Power Indigo2 workstation, Power Challenge server, Power ChallengeArray cluster and Power Onyx visualization system. In the November 1994 TOP500 list, 50 systems out of 500 used the R8000. The highest ranked R8000-based systems were four Power Challenges at positions 154 to 157. Each had 18 R8000s.\n\nDescription\nThe chip set consisted of the R8000 microprocessor, the R8010 floating-point unit, two Tag RAMs, and the streaming cache. The R8000 is superscalar, capable of issuing up to four instructions per cycle, and executes instructions in program order. It has a five-stage integer pipeline.\n\nR8000\n\nThe R8000 controlled the chip set and executed integer instructions. It contained the integer execution units, integer register file, primary caches and hardware for instruction fetch, branch prediction the translation lookaside buffers (TLBs).\n\nIn stage one, four instructions are fetched from the instruction cache. The instruction cache is 16 kB large, direct-mapped, virtually tagged and virtually indexed, and has a 32-byte line size. Instruction decoding and register reads occur during stage two, and branch instructions are resolved as well, leading to a one-cycle branch mispredict penalty. Load and store instructions begin execution in stage three, and integer instructions in stage four. Integer execution was delayed until stage four so that integer instructions which use the result of a load as an operand may be issued in the cycle after the load. Results are written to the integer register file in stage five.\n\nThe integer register file has nine read ports and four write ports. Four read ports supply operands to the two integer execution units (the branch unit was considered part of an integer unit).  Another four read ports supply operands to the two address generators.  Four ports are needed, rather than two, because of the base(register) + index(register) address style added in the MIPS IV ISA.  The R8000 issues at most one integer store per cycle, and one final read port delivers the integer store data.\n\nTwo register file write ports are used to write results from the two integer functional units.  The R8000 issues two integer loads per cycle, and the other two write ports are used to write the results of integer loads to the register file.\n\nThe level 1 data cache was organized as two redundant arrays, each of which had one read port and one write port.  Integer stores were written to both arrays.  Two loads could be processed in parallel, one on each array.\n\nInteger functional units consisted of two integer units, a shift unit, a multiply-divide unit, and two address generator units. Multiply and divide instructions are executed in the multiply-divide unit, which is not pipelined. As a result, the latency for a multiply instruction is four cycles for 32-bit operands and six cycles for 64-bit. The latency for a divide instruction depends on the number of significant digits in the result and thus it varies from 21 to 73 cycles.\n\nLoads and stores\nLoads and stores begin execution in stage three. The R8000 has two address generation units (AGUs) that calculate virtual address for loads and stores. In stage four, the virtual addresses are translated to physical addresses by a dual-ported TLB that contains 384 entries and is three-way set associative. The 16 kB data cache is accessed in the same cycle. It is dual-ported, and is accessed via two 64-bit buses. It can service two loads or one load and one store per cycle. The cache is not protected by parity or by error correcting code (ECC). In the event of a cache miss, the data must be loaded from the streaming cache with an eight-cycle penalty. The cache is virtually indexed, physically tagged, direct mapped, has a 32-byte line size and uses a write-through with allocate protocol. If the loads hit in the data cache, the result is written to the integer register file in stage five.\n\nR8010\n\nThe R8010 executed floating-point instructions provided by an instruction queue on the R8000. The queue decoupled the floating-point pipeline from the integer pipeline, implementing a limited form of out-of-order execution by allowing floating-point instructions to execute when possible after or before the integer instructions from the same group are issued. The pipelines were decoupled to help mitigate some of the streaming cache latency.\n\nIt contained the floating-point register file, a load queue, a store queue, and two identical floating-point units. All instructions except for divide and square-root are pipelined. The R8010 implements an iterative division and square-root algorithm that uses the multiplier for a key part, requiring the pipeline to be stalled the unit for the duration of the operation.\n\nArithmetic instructions except for compares have a four-cycle latency. Single and double precision divides have latencies of 14 and 20 cycles, respectively; and single and double precision square-roots have latencies of 14 and 23 cycles, respectively.\n\nStreaming cache and Tag RAMs\nThe streaming cache is an external 1 to 16 MB cache that serves as the R8000's L2 unified cache and the R8010's L1 data cache. It operates at the same clock rate as the R8000 and is built from commodity synchronous static RAMs. This scheme was used to attain sustained floating point performance, which requires frequent access to data. A small low-latency primary cache would not contain enough data and frequently miss, necessitating long latency refiles that reduce performance.\n\nThe streaming cache is two-way interleaved. It has two independent banks, each containing data from even or odd addresses. It can therefore perform two reads, two writes, or a read and a write every cycle, provided that the two accesses are to separate banks. Each bank is accessed via two 64-bit unidirectional buses, one for reads, and the other for writes. This scheme was used to avoid bus turnover, which is required by bidirectional buses. By avoiding bus turnover, the cache can be read from in one cycle and then written to in the next cycle without an intervening cycle for turnover, resulting in improved performance.\n\nThe streaming cache's tags are contained on two Tag RAM chips, one for each bank. Both chips contain identical data. Each chip contains 1.189 Mbit of cache tags implemented by four-transistor SRAM cells. The chips are implemented in a 0.7 μm BiCMOS process with two levels of polysilicon and two levels of aluminium interconnect. BiCMOS circuitry was used in the decoders and combined sense amplifier and comparator portions of the chip to reduce cycle time. Each Tag RAM is 14.8 mm by 14.8 mm large, packaged in a 155-pin CPGA, and dissipates 3 W at 75 MHz. In addition to providing the cache tags, the Tag RAMs are responsible for the streaming cache being four-way set associative. To avoid high a pin count, the cache tags are four-way set associative and logic selects which set to access after lookup instead of the usual way of implementing set-associative caches.\n\nAccess to the streaming cache is pipelined to mitigate some of the latency. The pipeline has five stages: in stage one, addresses are sent to the Tag RAMs, which are accessed in stage two. Stage three is for the signals from the Tag RAMs to propagate to the SSRAMs. In stage four, the SSRAMs are accessed and data is returned to the R8000 or R8010 in stage five.\n\nPhysical\nThe R8000 contained 2.6 million transistors and measured 17.34 mm by 17.30 mm (299.98 mm²). The R8010 contained 830,000 transistors. In total, the two chips contained 3.43 million transistors. Both were fabricated by Toshiba in their VHMOSIII process, a 0.7 μm, triple-layer metal complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process. Both are packaged in 591-pin ceramic pin grid array (CPGA) packages. Both chips used a 3.3 V power supply, and the R8000 dissipated 13 W at 75 MHz.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \"Aligning Instructions for Multiple Dispatch\".

Shahreza was selected as the national city of pottery in Iran in 2015. The reason for this choice was the high skill of the artists and the unique soil of this city.\n\nAt the 2006 National Census, its population was 108,299 in 30,368 households. The following census in 2011 counted 123,767 people in 37,113 households. The latest census in 2016 showed a population of 134,952 people in 43,478 households.\n\nSituation\n\nShahreza is located 508 km south to Tehran and about 80 km south west to Isfahan and Zard Kooh mountain chain runs from north-west to south-east of the city, enjoying a cold climate.  It is an old city which was first named Qomsheh, but later on its name was changed to Shahreza due to the existence there of the shrine of Shahreza.  The most important tourist attractions are:  Mahyar caravanserai, Shah Reza caravanserai, the Shah Ghandab caves, located south-east of Shahreza, the Poodeh mosque, and Shahreza Imamzadeh. Other tourist attractions include the Amin Abad caravanserai, a Safavid Empire structure in Amin Abad, a village 42 km south of Shahreza.\n\nShahreza is a strategic city due to having large military bases, rail transportation system, very fertile soil, having the second largest industrial town in Iran (Razi town) and connecting the north to south.\n\nIt is interesting that a part of the old Silk Road passed through the Choghad Shahreza area.\n\nHistory\n\nIt was one of the ancient territories of northern Pars (Persia) Satrapy in B.C.\nIn the north of the county there is canyon of Orchiny (Orchine) that the main Iranian north-south high way passes through.

{"id": "4047840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovant", "title": "Fovant", "text": "Fovant is a village and civil parish in southwest Wiltshire, England, lying about  west of Salisbury on the A30 Salisbury-Shaftesbury road, on the south side of the Nadder valley.\n\nHistory \nThe name is derived from the Old English Fobbefunta, meaning \"spring of a man called Fobbe\".\n\nThe Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a settlement called Febefonte with 22 households, held by Wilton Abbey. The abbey was surrendered to the Crown in 1539, and Fovant was among the villages granted to Sir William Herbert, later Earl of Pembroke. (Herbert was also granted the site of the abbey, where he built Wilton House). The Pembrokes continued as landowners at Fovant until the estate was broken up in 1919.\n\nAn elementary school was built in 1847 with places for 100 children, and gained a second classroom in 1875. Children of all ages attended until 1944, when those aged twelve and over transferred to the senior school at Tisbury. By 1958, when the buildings were modernised, there were 58 pupils. In the 1980s children aged 10 and 11 went to a middle school at Tisbury, and falling numbers led to closure of the Fovant school in 1997 when it had 27 pupils.\n\nDuring World War I a training camp was set up at Fovant which, according to one soldier stationed there, was 'as good a camp as Chiseldon was a bad one'. Owing to the leadership of 'a giant colonel now fairly old', the recruits were well cared for and fed.\n\nReligious sites\n\nParish church\n\nThe Church of England parish church of St George dates from the 13th century and has a south doorway taken from a 12th-century building. Much of the church was rebuilt in the 15th century; the tower was built c. 1492 and is surmounted with stone friezes and battlements. In the 16th century the last abbess of Wilton Abbey, Cecily Bodenham, retired to Fovant and is said to have paid for the building or rebuilding of the south aisle.\n\nRestoration in 1863 by T.H. Wyatt included the rebuilding of the chancel and major changes to the interior, including the removal of a musicians' gallery. One of the six bells in the tower is from the 15th century.\n\nThe building was designated as Grade II* listed in 1960. Today the parish is part of the Nadder Valley Team Ministry.\n\nChapel\nA Congregational chapel was completed in 1820 in dressed limestone, and continues in use as Fovant Free Church.\n\nMilitary connections\n\nDuring the First World War, temporary camps were built in the Fovant area to handle training and medical treatment of soldiers, and later their demobilisation. The Fovant Military Railway was built in 1915 from Dinton station, passing close to Fovant with a terminus east of the village near the A30. The camps stretched beyond Compton Chamberlayne into Barford St Martin parish, and included Hurdcott Camp which was a depot of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).\n\nThe area is known for several regimental badges cut in chalk into a nearby hill (also being the site of Chiselbury Iron Age hillfort), created by soldiers garrisoned near Fovant.\n\nGovernance\nThe civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.\n\nThe parish is part of the Fovant and Chalke Valley electoral ward. The ward begins in the Netherhampton parish just to the west of Salisbury, stretches west to Bishopstone and northwest to Fovant, ending at Tollard Royal. The population of the ward at the 2011 census was 4,315.\n\nAmenities\nFovant has a village shop (with post office), a village hall, playing field and playground. At one time with three public houses, Fovant also has a pub called The Greater Good formerly known as the Pembroke Arms.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nFovant village website\nFovant History Interest Group\n\nVillages in Wiltshire\nCivil parishes in Wiltshire"}

Al Garhoud Bridge forms the eastern end of the road toll (called Salik) that went into effect on 1 July 2007.  Since the beginning of Salik, Al Garhoud Bridge has seen low amounts of traffic for Dubai.\n\nOld Al Garhoud Bridge \nThe old Al Garhoud Bridge was the second bridge constructed that crossed the Creek, after Al Maktoum Bridge.  The bridge opened in 1976.  In 2007, nearly 9,000 vehicles crossed the bridge every hour at peak flow.  It has been the cause of huge traffic jams in Dubai.  The main reason for this was the number of roads that fed into the bridge.  On the Bur Dubai-bound lanes, seven lanes (from three different roads) converged into three lanes. For the Deira-bound lanes, five lanes converged into three lanes.  Also, the bridge had to be closed to allow large boats to pass under it.  The bridge had a total of 6 lanes: 3 lanes in each direction.\n\nNew Al Garhoud Bridge \n\nTo solve the major traffic problems caused by the old bridge, a replacement was constructed between 2006 and 2008 by Belgian main contractor BESIX.\nThe bridge, which cost 415 million dirhams, is meant to add more lanes of road that cross Dubai Creek.  The new Al Garhoud Bridge has a total of 14 lanes, 7 in each direction.  It is able to handle 16,000 vehicles per hour.  Construction of the bridge began in February 2006 and by  26 September 2007, 76% of the construction was completed.  The bridge is  long and  above the water.  On 15 December 2007, four lanes on the Deira-bound side were opened to vehicle traffic.  Then on 15 March 2008, as had been scheduled, remaining lanes on both sides were opened.  The old bridge was demolished after the new bridge opened.  Shortly after the bridge opened, the Roads and Transport Authority announced that Al Garhoud Bridge would be decorated with artwork that look like sand dunes during the day and waves at night with the aid of lighting.\n\nPhoto gallery\nConstruction Photos on 31 January 2007\n\nConstruction Photos on 1 May 2007\n\nConstruction Photo on 31 May 2007\n\nConstruction Photo on 18 October 2007\n\nReferences \n\nBridges in Dubai\nBridges in the United Arab Emirates\nBridges completed in 1976\nBridges completed in 2008\n1976 establishments in the United Arab Emirates"}
{"id": "4047853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska%20Aces%20%28PBA%29", "title": "Alaska Aces (PBA)", "text": "The Alaska Aces were a professional basketball team in the Philippine Basketball Association since 1986 under the ownership of Alaska Milk Corporation (AMC) and the owner of 14 PBA championships, tied with the Magnolia Hotshots for the third-most titles overall. They are one of the most popular teams in the league and the Philippines.\n\nThe Aces won nine PBA championships in the 1990s, including a rare grand slam (winning three championships in one season) during the 1996 season, joining the Crispa Redmanizers (1976, 1983), San Miguel Beermen (1989), and the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers (2013–14) as one of only four franchises to achieve the feat.\n\nThe Aces last tournament was the 2021 PBA Governors' Cup where they were eliminated by the NLEX Road Warriors in the quarterfinal round in March 2022. The franchise was bought by Converge ICT on March 23, 2022, to become the Converge FiberXers.\n\nHistory\n\n1986: First season\nAfter the temporary departure of the Magnolia franchise prior to the start of the 1986 PBA season, the league was reduced to only five teams. Alaska Milk was accepted as the league's sixth member. Being a pro league newcomer, the ballclub was allowed to choose players from the pool presented by the PBA. The team was headed by Filipino-American owner Wilfred Steven Uytengsu, team manager Joel Aquino and their coach was Tony Vasquez, who played for Ateneo de Manila during his playing days and as a coach, he piloted the Ateneo juniors to an NCAA championship and also once mentored the Blue Eagles.\n\nAmong the players they choose from the pool were Arnie Tuadles and Ricky Relosa from Ginebra, Rudy Distrito, Marte Saldaña and Noli Banate from Magnolia, Alejo Alolor, Teddy Alfarero and Frankie Lim from Great Taste, and Dennis Abbatuan from Shell. In the PBA draft, as the newest member of the league, they had the first crack and Alaska selected Rey Cuenco as the number one overall pick. In the second and third rounds, they choose Ludovico Valenciano and Reynaldo Ramos.\n\nTheir very first two imports in the first conference of the season were the returning Donnie Ray Koonce and Jerry Eaves, a third round draft pick by the Utah Jazz in 1982 and who played for Utah's entire 82-game regular season in his rookie year. Both were handpicked by Alaska coaching consultant Norman Black, the former import and coach of the defunct Magnolia quintet who signed a one-year contract with the new team.\n\nAlaska placed fourth in their inaugural conference and missed out the semifinal round in the second and third conferences, placing fifth and sixth.\n\n1987–1988: Bruise Brothers era\nA strike within Alaska Milk Corporation led the team to play under a different brand. AMC brought in Hills Bros. Coffee to mitigate the strike's impact on its brand. The ballclub, temporarily renamed as the Hills Bros. Coffee Kings, had a new coach in Nat Canson, who last coached the Gold Eagle Beer squad in 1984. Following Manila Beer's disbandment, the Coffee Kings acquired three players from the Brewmasters; Elpidio Villamin, Tim Coloso and sophomore Adonis Tierra. They also acquired three-time PBA MVP William 'Bogs' Adornado from Shell via trade and Ginebra discard Joey Marquez.\n\nIn the 1987 All-Filipino Conference, the Coffee Kings surprisingly made it to the finals against corporate rival Great Taste Coffee Makers. This mark the birth of the tandem known as the \"Bruise Brothers\" in Yoyoy Villamin and Ricky Relosa, both players during their earlier years in the PBA were the promising forwards of legendary teams Crispa and Toyota. Villamin played alongside Abet Guidaben and Philip Cezar for Crispa while Relosa were teammates with Ramon Fernandez and Abe King at Toyota. The Coffee Kings were swept in the finals by Great Taste in three games. Coach Nat Canson resigned three weeks after the championship series.\n\nFormer Tanduay coach Arturo Valenzona, who himself was ax from the job by Tanduay management after the Rhum Makers were eliminated, accepted the offer to coach the Hills Bros. Coffee Kings starting the third conference. Parading a sweet-shooting import Jose Slaughter, who breaks the previous record for most three-point shots converted with 14 triples as he finished with 79 points in the October 18 game against Great Taste which they won, 129–115. Hills Bros were in their second finals stint after beating the Billy Ray Bates led-Ginebra in a playoff game on December 1, 1987. They faced San Miguel Beermen (formerly Magnolia) in the Reinforced Conference championship series and after winning Game One, they lost the next four games and finished bridesmaid for the second straight conference of the season.\n\nReturning to Alaska Milk in the 1988 PBA season, the team signed three players from Shell; Rey Lazaro, Biboy Ravanes and Willie Pearson to strengthen its lineup. Before the start of the season, Bogs Adornado announces his retirement from active playing and was given recognition by the PBA in the opening day on March 20, 1988. Alaska placed third in the Open and All-Filipino Conference of the season. Bogs Adornado would replace Arturo Valenzona as the team's head coach beginning the third conference.\n\n1989–1992: Arrival of coach Tim Cone and Jolas with their 1st title\nThe year 1989 was an exciting year for Alaska as the team drafted the high-leaping Paul Alvarez and the backcourt tandem of Ric-Ric Marata and Elmer Cabahug. Veteran center Abet Guidaben, who has been disgruntled in the last three months of the 1988 season following a bitter trade with Ramon Fernandez that sent him to Purefoods Hotdogs, has joined the bruise brothers to form an awesome force inside the paint. Alaska was able to hire Sean Chambers, who played with the American selection in two previous PBA/IBA series, as their import to replaced their first choice Carl Lott in the 1989 Open Conference. Chambers led Alaska to a third-place finish in his first PBA stint.\n\nAmerican Tim Cone, a member of the PBA's vintage panel, accepted the coaching chores for Alaska Milk on full-time starting the All-Filipino Conference. Alaska has long without a coach when Bogs Adornado was sacked after the elimination round of the first conference and team manager Joel Aquino handled the team on interim basis.\n\nAlaska continues to struggle despite the mixture of veterans and young players in the roster and team owner Wilfred Uytengsu could not hide his disappointment when the Milkmen went winless in the semifinals of the 1990 All-Filipino Conference. They got rid of one of their veterans; Abet Guidaben, who was traded to Pepsi for Harmon Codiñera.\n\nIn the third conference of the 1990 PBA season, Alaska finally advances in the finals for the third time in franchise history and their first since the 1987 season. Going up against the Purefoods Hotdogs, both teams were gunning for their first championship. Alaska had former Boston Celtic Carlos Clark and Sean Chambers as their imports to be pitted against Daren Queenan and Robert Rose of the Hotdogs. The Milkmen went up 2–0 in the best-of-five title series and on a threshold of winning their first trophy, but Purefoods came back and win the last three games to capture the 1990 PBA third conference crown.\n\n1991:The JOLAS Era a.k.a. The Helicopter and Mr. Clutch.\n\nBeginning the 1991 PBA season, the team let go of its vital cog, Yoyoy Villamin, who was traded along with Ric-ric Marata to Sarsi. Elmer Cabahug was shipped to Purefoods and Alaska acquired the Hotdogs star player Jojo Lastimosa in return as he will team up with Paul Alvarez in which coach Tim Cone describes as unbeatable tandem. Alaska signed their two first round picks in the rookie draft, Alex Araneta and Eugene Quilban and their third rookie, Rhoel Gomez. There were criticisms on some of Alaska's moves during the off-season as they say experience was supposed to win championships instead of the fountain of youth.\n\nAfter a third-place showing in the All-Filipino Conference, the Milkmen returned to the finals in the Third Conference with Paul Alvarez back in form after being idle for almost eight months, recuperating from the injury he suffered in 1990, in Game three of the title playoffs. Playing against crowd-favorite Ginebra San Miguel, the Milkmen finally won their first PBA title, winning the best of five series, three games to one. Alaska import Sean Chambers got the better of his counterpart, Ginebra import Wes Matthews, in the four-game series.\n\nIn 1992, Alaska owned the second pick in the draft and they choose the burly 6'4\" Stevenson Solomon, who had been in the mold of a Yoyoy Villamin and was part of the national team that regain the SEA Games basketball gold in Manila. Another national player, Allen Sasan, was chosen by Alaska in the first round. Despite a stronger lineup compared to the previous year, and with Lastimosa and Alvarez playing together for one full season, the Milkmen were eliminated in the All-Filipino and third conferences.\n\n1993–1995: The Abarrientos era and the rivalry with Sunkist\nAlaska previously had the best point guards in the past four years to back up their veteran and starting point guard Frankie Lim, Ricric Marata for two years, then Eugene Quilban and Gilbert 'Jun' Reyes (whom Quilban was traded for), all big names during their amateur days. In 1993, Alaska picks another point guard in the rookie draft as the third overall, former FEU Tamaraw Johnny Abarrientos, who has been making waves in the Philippine Basketball League, winning PBL titles for three seasons and was expected to follow the footsteps of Hector Calma and Ronnie Magsanoc in the pros. He will be the starting point guard of Alaska as Frankie Lim, the last among the original milkmen, decided to moved out and joined the Purefoods TJ Hotdogs.\n\nThe beginning of what turn out to be a dynasty in the second part of the 1990s started in the 1994 season. The Milkmen in the middle of last year acquired forward Bong Hawkins from Sta. Lucia Realtors. The team selected 6'5\" center Poch Juinio in the 1994 PBA draft. Alaska would win their second PBA title in the third conference called Governors Cup, defeating Swift Mighty Meaties in six games.\n\nSwift, renamed Sunkist Orange Juicers in the 1995 PBA season, became Alaska's finals rival that year. They played in the championship in the first two conferences of the season and the Orange Juicers prevailed both times. The three consecutive finals meeting between the two teams was the first since Crispa and Toyota in 1975–1976. Alaska was able to stop Sunkist' quest for a grandslam by retaining the Governors Cup crown, defeating San Miguel Beermen in seven games.\n\n1996 Grand Slam\nAlaska return to the All-Filipino Cup finals against Purefoods, who were back in the All-Filipino finals after missing out in 1995. The Milkmen were considered the underdogs before the best of seven title showdown. They outbattled a tough and gritty TJ Hotdogs and won in just five games. Last season's rookie of the year Jeffrey Cariaso converted two free throws with 0.6 of a second remaining in overtime of Game five and Purefoods up by one, 92–91, to win it in a fitting moment as Alaska won their first All-Filipino title and their fourth PBA crown.\n\nThe Milkmen were in their seventh straight finals appearance when they go up against surprise finalist Formula Shell for the Commissioner's Cup title. The Milkmen were given a hard time by the Shell team of Benjie Paras, Victor Pablo and import Kenny Redfield. The finals series went into a seventh and deciding game and Alaska's championship experience prove to be a key factor in winning, 83–77. Their import, Sean Chambers, was a late replacement for Derrick Hamilton, who was sent packing after traces of Marijuana were discovered in his urine during the last stages of the semifinals.\n\nIn the Governor's Cup, Alaska completed the PBA's fourth grandslam, defeating Ginebra San Miguel in five games. In the year-end awards, Johnny Abarrientos was named MVP, Bong Hawkins settled for the Mythical five with Jojo Lastimosa, Starting center Poch Juinio was the season's most improved player and Sean Chambers was a runaway winner of the best import award.\n\nThe dynasty continues (1997–1998)\nBefore the 1997 PBA season started, Alaska lost three players who were integral part of the team that bagged four straight titles, they are Jun Reyes, whom Alaska dealt to Sta.Lucia in exchange for Boyet Fernandez, center Cris Bolado, who moved to Purefoods, and Jeffrey Cariaso, who was shipped to Mobiline. New acquisitions Dwight Lago, Rodney Santos and Boyet Fernandez would be hampered by their unfamiliarity with Alaska's vaunted triangle offense.\n\nIn the All-Filipino Cup, the Milkmen were eliminated from the semifinals for the first time in four years. They return to the finals in the Commissioner's Cup but lost to Gordon's Gin Boars (formerly Ginebra) in six games. Alaska was able to retain the only crown left in their grandslam conquest last year by winning their fourth straight Governor's Cup trophy. Late in the eliminations, they acquired veteran center Jack Tanuan and the high-flying Kenneth Duremdes in exchange for Dwight Lago and Boyet Fernandez from Pop Cola. Duremdes became a perfect replacement for Cariaso and in the title series against Purefoods Carne Norte Beefies, the Milkmen had an easier time in winning four games to one after losing the series opener. Alaska showed no mercy in a 94–66 rout in Game five.\n\nThe Milkmen were in a bid for a second grandslam in the 1998 season after defeating the Ron Jacobs-coached San Miguel Beermen twice in the finals of the first two conferences. They came back from a 2–3 series deficit in the All-Filipino Cup to win in seven games. In the Commissioner's Cup, dreadlock-sporting Devin Davis became the only other Alaska import in the 1990s besides Sean Chambers to lead the team to the crown. The Milkmen won their 9th PBA title, tying the famed Toyota Super Corollas as the third winningest ball club.\n\nThe possible 'Grand Slam II' for the team didn't happen with the 1998 Asian Games set in December and Cone being named head coach, Abarrientos, Duremdes and Lastimosa were tapped to lead the Philippine team.\n\nAssistants Jun Reyes and Dickey Bachmann took over for Alaska. But despite a strong showing from the slasher Rodney Santos and their resident shooter, Rhoel Gomez, the Milkmen failed to enter the semis of both the special 1998 PBA Centennial Cup and the season-ending Governor's Cup.\n\nDuremdes was named the Most Valuable Player at the end of the year, the second Alaska Milkmen to win the coveted individual award.\n\n10th PBA title\nWith the arrival of some talented Filipino-American cagers in the league, the Milkmen opted to stick with the same core for the 1999 season. In the All-Filipino, the Milkmen was eliminated by expansion team Tanduay in the semis.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, Devin Davis made his return to the team, but the young San Miguel team of Danny Ildefonso and Danny Seigle conspired with their import, Terquin Mott, to eliminate the Aces in five games. They finished third in the tournament.\n\nAlaska advanced to the Finals of the Governor's Cup with Chambers at the helm but San Miguel, led by Lamont \"The Helicopter\" Strothers, defeated the Milkmen in six games despite Alaska getting an early 2–1 series lead.\n\nIn 2000, Jojo Lastimosa was traded to Pop Cola as part of the team's future plan to rebuild. Alaska won their 10th PBA title at the expense of Purefoods in the All-Filipino Conference. Purefoods won Game one of this series but the Milkmen won the next four games to win the series.\n\nThe Milkmen failed to enter the Finals of the Commissioner's Cup after they were eliminated by the Beermen in the semi-finals.\n\n2001–2022: Alaska Aces\nAs part of the league's move to strengthen its marketing through the PBA Properties, Alaska adopted a new moniker the Alaska Aces. Despite the change Alaska failed to reach the Finals of the Governor's Cup once again.\n\n2000–01 season\n\nBefore the 2001 season, the Aces traded popular star Johnny Abarrientos to the Pop Cola Panthers for forward Ali Peek and guard Jon Ordonio. In the draft, Alaska used the fifth pick to draft fil-am John Arigo. The Aces also signed Duremdes to a reported 48 million peso deal for seven years.  In the All-Filipino conference, the Aces were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Abarrientos and Pop Cola. In the Commissioners Cup, a strong showing by Peek gave defending champion San Miguel a fight but still loss in five games of the semis. In the Governors Cup, they were eliminated in the quarterfinals.  Chambers retired three games into the Governors Cup. In a simple ceremony, the Aces retired his #20 jersey, becoming the second player in team history to have his number retired.\n\n2001–02 season\n\nDuremdes was borrowed by the Philippine National Team in 2002 and Lastimosa made his return to Alaska. The Aces, with Ron Riley and Montreal Dobbins as imports, but after 6 games, Dobbins was replaced by James Head, advanced to the finals of the Governor's Cup against Purefoods. The Aces led 2–0 in the seven-game series, but the TJ Hotdogs won the next three games. After Alaska tied it up in Game Six, Purefoods won Game seven to deny the Aces its 11th title. In the Commissioner's Cup, Ajani Williams and Chris Carawell bannered the Aces but was eliminated by Talk N' Text in the semi-finals. Duremdes returned for the Aces in the All-Filipino and made it to the finals. After winning Game 1, the Aces lost the next three games to settle another runner-up finish.\n\n2002–03 season: Invitational Champs\n\nIn the 2003 PBA Draft, Alaska shocked the league by trading their superstar, Kenneth Duremdes to the Sta. Lucia Realtors for the fifth pick of the first round. This enabled Alaska to get Brandon Cablay as the team's top draft pick.  The Aces also held the first overall pick in the draft and selected De La Salle University-Manila star point guard Mike Cortez, who was considered as the next great point guard in the Alaska franchise's history, following Johnny Abarrientos.\n\nDuring halftime of their season opening game, Alaska retired Jojo Lastimosa's #6 jersey. During the offseason, Lastimosa announced his retirement after playing 15 seasons in the league. He became one of the team's assistant coaches under coach Cone's era.\n\nIn the All-Filipino, Alaska failed in its bid to enter the Finals as they were eliminated by Talk 'N Text in a grueling five-game series. However, the Aces won the third-place trophy via a blowout in expense of the San Miguel Beermen.\n\nIn the Invitational tournament, Alaska had to play in the qualifying round to enter the tournament. The Aces swept the elimination round, winning all four of its games, to make it to the semis.

Lucia in the quarters.\n\n2003–04 Fiesta Conference\n\nAlaska paraded former NBA journeyman Galen Young for the 2004 Fiesta Conference. The Aces placed second after the elimination round of the tournament. But, they failed to enter the finals of the said tournament winning only one game in three outings in the semi-finals.\n\n2004–05 season\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, the Aces managed to finished fourth in the qualifying round. After eliminating FedEx in the Wild-Card phase, they were swept by San Miguel in the quarters. During the tournament, Arigo and Peek were shipped to Coca-Cola for Jeffrey Cariaso and Reynel Hugnatan. Bong Hawkins also made his return to the Aces, reuniting him with Cariaso, assistant coach Jojo Lastimosa, and Cone.  Alaska hired Leon Derricks for the Fiesta Conference. However, his inconsistent game led to his replacement by former Chicago Bull Dickey Simpkins. The addition of Simpkins helped Alaska climb into third place at the end of the classification round. The Aces faced Red Bull Thunder in the semis. A back injury sustained by Simpkins, after being elbowed in the back by Dorian Peña, prevented him from playing at full strength during the series. Former Alaska Ace, Bryan Gahol, hit the last second shot in Game three to eliminate Alaska from the tournament.\n\n2005–06 season\n\nPrior to the start of the 2005–06 PBA season, the Aces built up their lineup by acquiring national team pool members, Tony dela Cruz and Rich Alvarez from the disbanding Shell Turbo Chargers. They also acquired the services of former Mobiline and Coca-Cola import Artemus \"Tee\" McClary for the Fiesta Conference.  After the Aces placed second behind Team Pilipinas in the Brunei Sultan's Cup, with Dela Cruz playing for the said team, the team was considered as one of the top contenders to win the upcoming season.  However, they went on a slide after a good start. After Alaska blowing a 28-point lead and losing to the Purefoods Chunkee Giants, the team went on a downhill since. With McClary's decline starting to show, he was eventually replaced by the 3-point shooting Odell Bradley who showed some impressive scoring outputs. However, Alaska still finished seventh in the classification phase with a 7–9 record.  The Aces swept Sta. Lucia in a best-of-three matchup in the wildcard phase before being swept in a best-of-five affair by eventual champion Red Bull Barako.\n\nWeeks before the start of the Philippine Cup, Alaska traded Brandon Cablay to San Miguel in exchange for veteran Nic Belasco. On May 8, 2006, they traded Don Allado to Talk 'N Text for guard Willie Miller, forward John Ferriols, & 2006 first round pick.

The opening game of the series saw Alaska winning on a last second three-pointer by Nic Belasco. In the semi-finals against top-seed Purefoods Chunkee Giants, the Aces led 3–1 and was a win away from a finals berth but failed to win all of the remaining games. Alaska would end the tournament on a winning note, capturing the third-place trophy with a 102–95 win over San Miguel, their 12th third-place finish in team history.\n\n2006–07 season: Fiesta Conference Champions\nHead coach Tim Cone signed a contract extension to remain with the team, erasing speculation of his possible dismissal. In the 2006 PBA Draft, Alaska selected Letran's Aaron Aban and UST's Christian Luanzon.\n\nAlaska started the 2006–07 PBA Philippine Cup poorly but rebounded to finish with an 8–10 record for a wildcard berth. After losing in a last-second overtime thriller against Coca-Cola, and a win by Sta. Lucia on the next game date eliminated Alaska from contention despite winning their last game against Sta. Lucia.\n\nInjuries to Reynel Hugnatan and Mike Cortez affected the team's play throughout the said conference.\n\nHowever, Alaska started the 2007 PBA Fiesta Conference with a 7–4 card before the All-Star break, with Roselle Ellis as their import. Shooting Guard, Willie Miller provided a strong performance for the Aces during the tournament posting numerous 20 point-games.\n\nThe return of Cortez sparked a late surge by the team by finishing with a 12–6 record and beat Ginebra in a one-game playoff to earn an outright semifinals berth.\n\nAfter eliminating the San Miguel Beermen in the semifinals via a 4–2 series win, the Aces entered the finals for a 19th time to meet the Talk 'N Text Phone Pals.\n\nDespite a 1–2 and a 2–3 deficit in the titular showdown, Miller, named the league's Most Valuable Player, erupted for 29 points to tie the series in Game 4 and recovered from a dismal performance in Game 5 with a sterling 37-point output in Game 6 to force a decider.\n\nThe seventh game was a seesaw battle before Miller fired a go-ahead layup and a Reynel Hugnatan freethrow in the last two minutes to seal a 99–96 championship win for Alaska.\n\n2007–08 season\nAlaska picked Adamson stalwart, Ken Bono, and University of Visayas Green Lancers starting center, JR \"Baby Shaq\" Quiñahan as the 6th and 7th overall picks of the 2007 PBA Draft along with second round selection Ardy Larong.\n\nIn order to free up some cap spaces, the team traded veteran forward Nic Belasco to Welcoat in exchange for Junjun Cabatu while signing free agent Ariel Capus.\n\nIn the 2007–08 Philippine Cup, the Aces lost at the semis against Sta. Lucia.\n\nBefore the start of the Fiesta Conference, Alaska acquired former King Blue Eagles LA Tenorio and Larry Fonacier in exchange for ace point guard Mike Cortez and 1st round draft pick Ken Bono. They also tapped former Chicago Bull and Talk 'N Text import Randy Holcomb as their reinforcement to help them defend the crown. Alaska, started slowly winning only 2 of their 6 matches including a 4-game losing streak. Then came a rumor that Holcomb will be replaced by former Milwaukee Buck Daniel Santiago. However, it was confirmed that the rumors were not true and they were not in negotiations with the Puerto Rico national team starting center. Alaska came on to a conference high 6-game winning streak and made their record to 8–6 and had a chance of getting a semi-final seat.\n\nIn their 2nd-round game against Magnolia, Alaska was trailing along the way until the final minute which they came in and even grabbed the lead, but Alaska's semi-final dream came to an end when a call by the referee with 0.3 seconds left caused them the game. Tied at 99 all, former Alaska Ace Mike Cortez split his freethrows to give Magnolia a one-point lead. However, Larry Fonacier's jumper went in front of the rim as time expired and Magnolia escaped with a nail-biting 100–99 win over the defending champions.\n\n2008–09 season: On the road to 13th title\nIn the 2008 Annual Rookie Draft held on August 31, 2008, at Market! Market!, Taguig, Alaska drafted scoring guard Solomon Mercado at fifth in the first round and grabbing Mapúa star Kelvin dela Peña at fifteenth in the second round. A day after the draft, the team acquired 2007 first overall pick and team leading scorer Joe Devance from Rain or Shine (formerly Welcoat Dragons) in exchange for Solomon Mercado and wingman Eddie Laure.\n\nOn September 4, 2008, the team signed 2004 7th overall pick Ervin Sotto.

Meanwhile, the team also signed veteran 6–9 Eric Canlas through free agency.\n\nThe Aces started their campaign on their quest for their 4th All-Filipino crown on a high note including a 4–0 start. They struggled in the middle part of the conference but still remained the leader in the standings. Alaska finished as the number one team after the elimination round winning 12 games in 18 matches and was the first team to secure a seat in the Semifinals giving them a long rest. After three weeks of waiting, they faced the defending Philippine Cup champion Sta. Lucia Realtors, a re-match of last year's Semifinals which went to a seven-game grueling series. The Realtors swept the depleted-lineup of the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters in the Quarterfinals. The Aces beat the defending champion Realtors in six games to advance and arranged a Finals showdown with the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters. They had a 2–0 lead first but Talk 'N Text tied the series 2–2. In Game 5, Alaska won 95–93 courtesy by Willie Miller's tough three-point shot. In Game 6, Talk 'N Text tied the series 3–3 to force a Game 7. In Game 7, they had a chance to win the title but the missed free throws during the crucial seconds of the game by Miller and Joe Devance gave Talk 'N Text the win and the title, 93–89.\n\n2009–10 season: two straight Finals appearances and their 13th title\nIn the All-Filipino Cup, Alaska started strong and finished in first place in the standings, earning them an automatic semi-final seat. Willie Miller led the Aces in scoring with LA Tenorio continued to blossom for the Aces. They swept Ginebra in the semi-finals and faced Purefoods for the championship, who defeated San Miguel in the semis. Despite their strong output during the eliminations, Purefoods swept them in the finals, including three straight game heart-breaking losses.\n\nIn the Fiesta Conference, Alaska paraded import Diamon Simpson. Simpson, who played for the Los Angeles D-Fenders, an NBA D-League team and affiliate of back-to-back NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers before coming to the PBA, was very impressive and fit perfectly into Tim Cone's Triangle System. He nearly averaged 30 points and 20 rebounds a game and made Alaska the favorites to win it all in the import-laden conference.  In the middle of the conference, leading scorer Willie Miller was traded to the Barangay Ginebra Kings in exchange for high flyer Cyrus Baguio. It was stated by Miller's agent  that Miller wanted out of Alaska before the season started. After the trade was approved and made, in a coincidence, Alaska's next game was against Ginebra. In that game, the Aces trailed most of the game until the fourth quarter, when Cyrus Baguio finally exploded for 14 points to lead Alaska to a come from behind win. The Aces put team captain Jeffrey Cariaso in the reserve list in what would have been his retirement but a few games later, Cariaso returned to play once more. Alaska also signed veteran guard Topex Robinson during the season.\n\nAlaska met rival Talk N Text in the semi-finals. LA Tenorio was awarded as the Most Improved Player in the league. Former Alaska point guard Johnny Abarrientos announced his retirement after playing 15 seasons in the league. The Aces defeated the Tropang Texters in a grueling seven-game series despite being down 2–3. The Aces met top seed San Miguel Beermen led by best import Gabe Freeman in the finals. The Aces dominated the Beermen and won their 12th Championship in six games. LA Tenorio and Cyrus Baguio were named co-Finals MVPs of the series.\n\nAt the end of the season, Jeffrey Cariaso retired and Tony Dela Cruz was named the new captain of the team.\n\n2010–11 season: The franchise's 25th anniversary\nBefore the season began, the Aces celebrated their 25th anniversary as a PBA franchise on September 28, 2010. During the commemoration, they formally retired the jerseys of Bong Hawkins (#16) and Johnny Abarrientos (#14). Both players were instrumental for their grandslam finish in 1996.  On draft day, they traded shooter Larry Fonacier to Talk 'N Text in exchange for the fourth overall pick which was used to pick former UE Warrior Elmer Espiritu.  With Jeffrey Cariaso already retired, they traded their second pick in first round to Meralco for another former UE player Bonbon Custodio. They also drafted JRU's Marvin Hayes as #2 pick in the second round.\n\nFor the duration of the Philippine Cup, they sported their throwback early 1990s light uniform temporary replacing their current light jersey. They finished the conference with a 7–7 record. Thanks to Joe Devance's improved play, good enough for them to be qualified in the quarterfinals. However, they were defeated by Ginebra in a do-or-die five games series despite leading 2–0 and up by 20 in game 5.\n\nIn the 2011 Commissioner's Cup, they paraded former Chicago Bull Eddie Basden as their import. Before the conference started, the Aces played in Cebu for an Invitational Tournament that made them the champions in the said league. However, Basden failed to pass the height limit requirement for imports which was 6'4. They quickly replaced him with 2010 NBA D-League Slam Dunk Champion LD Williams. They also traded long time bruiser Reynel Hugnatan to Meralco for young guns Hans Thiele and Paolo Bugia, released Marvin Hayes and signed guard Don Dulay. Topex Robinson, who still has a live contract with Alaska, joined Tim Cone's crew as one of the assistant coaches of the team.\n\nBefore the start of the 2011 Governor's Cup, they traded rookie Elmer Espiritu to Air21 in exchange for swingman Wesley Gonzales. On May 27, 2011, Alaska was forced to let go of Joe Devance after the talented Fil-Am forward begged off. Team manager Joaqui Trillo, however, stressed Devance was guaranteed the maximum pay through the end of his current contract. They eventually decided to trade him to Air21 Express for Jay-R Reyes. On the next day, Commissioner Salud requested Air21 to add up another player or its 2011 first round pick as he finds the trade \"uneven\". The Express responded with the 2011 and 2012 second round picks making Salud nod in the deal. The Aces also signed PBA Veteran Aries Dimaunahan. In the third conference, they had a slow start, losing their first two games but quickly bounced back winning four of their last five games, thanks to import Jason Forte's hustle play. The team's improved play led by LA Tenorio and Cyrus Baguio plus newcomer Wesley Gonzales' \"real game\" started to pay off, and the Aces qualified to the step ladder semifinals. The Aces finished with 8 wins in 13 outings including the semifinals despite losing key players Cyrus Baguio and Wesley Gonzales to injuries. But due to the controversial quotient system, Alaska failed to enter the finals with Petron having the superior quotient despite with the same records with Ginebra and the Aces itself.\n\n2011–12 Tim Cone era ends; Joel Banal succeeds\n\nThe Aces released Paolo Bugia, Don Dulay and Mike Burtscher, while guard Aries Dimaunahan returned to Shopinas.com Clickers where his rights are based. In the 2011 PBA draft, Alaska picked former FEU main man and Smart-Gilas standout Mac Baracael at sixth overall in the first round. In the second round, the Aces have four picks and used it to get former Blue Eagle leading scorer Eric Salamat at the 13th, mystery Fil-Am Julius Pasculado at the 14th, and big man Ariel Mepana at the 15th. The Aces also owned the 17th pick but decided to trade it to Meralco for its 2014 second round pick.\n\nOn September 1, 2011, Alaska team owner Wilfred Steven Uytengsu held a rare press conference announcing Tim Cone's departure as head coach of the Aces after spending 22 years at the helm with the team. He said that Cone left Alaska to seek opportunities outside of the organization. He was succeeded by his lead assistant Joel Banal, who inked a three-year deal to lead the team.  In his first conference as the Aces' new tactician, the team struggled in the All-Filipino Cup and had one of their worst finishes in years, winning only three games out of fourteen outings.\nThey recruited 6'10 Matt Haryasz out of Stanford University as their reinforcement for the Commissioner's Cup. However, Haryasz was replaced by returning import and Mexico national team member Adam Parada before the start of the conference. The Aces also signed swingman Niño Gelig to bolster their lineup. Gelig had been a former teammate of Cyrus Baguio and were known as the dynamic combo during their UST days in the UAAP as well as in the now-defunct PBL.\n\nOn April 16, 2012, Banal stepped down as coach. Alaska owner Wilfred Uytengsu appointed long-time assistant coach Luigi Trillo, son of the current PBA governor Joaqui Trillo to handle the team for the rest of the season. They also brought back Jason Forte as reinforcement in  the Governor's Cup. They went on and finished 9th in the league winning only two of their nine outings. The Aces failed to enter the quarter-finals with the team having its worst finish in a season since it joined the league.\n\n2012–13 season: The Calvin Abueva era,Champions again\nHaving earned the second worst record the season before, Alaska was awarded with the second overall pick in the draft lottery. On August 19, 2012, at the PBA Rookie Draft, the Aces selected NCAA Season 87 MVP Calvin Abueva of the San Sebastian Stags as the second overall pick. As most of the analysts said that Abueva, who was monickered as \"the Beast\" due to his impressive basketball skills, had been the most talented player in the draft. Abueva leads the NCAA in points, rebounds and assists directory. While in the second round, the Aces snatched former UE Warrior point guard Raphy Reyes and swingman Karl Dehesa. They also retained head coach Luigi Trillo and hired Alex Compton, Louie Alas and reinstated Topex Robinson as assistant coaches. Leo Austria was supposed to join the Aces' coaching staff as well but focused first with his head coaching job at Adamson University, making him available for next year. Dickie Bachmann was promoted to assistant manager while Jojo Lastimosa was tasked to man the sports camp director post.\n\nTwo weeks after the draft, the Aces made another blockbuster deal involving four other teams. As a result, they sent point guard LA Tenorio to Ginebra and acquired JVee Casio, Dondon Hontiveros, and Ginebra's 2015 2nd Round Pick. They also signed second round draft pick Raphy Reyes to boost their back court and brought back veterans Nic Belasco and Eddie Laure, who helped the Aces win the championship last 2007.  After the San Sebastian College-Recoletos Golden Stags bowed out at the hands of Letran Knights in the NCAA Final Four, Abueva signs with the Aces in a three-year max rookie deal.\n\nThe Aces managed to finish 5th in the standings with eight wins on fourteen meetings to qualify the quarterfinals. They swept 4th-seed Meralco Bolts, in two games and entered the semifinals to face defending champion Talk 'N Text. Many are surprised with the Aces' performance as they pushed the defending champions in six grueling games before losing.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, Alaska tapped former University of Memphis Tiger Robert Dozier as their reinforcement. They also nabbed Aldrech Ramos from San Mig Coffee after trading Mac Baracael to Ginebra. Dozier fit perfectly well in the Aces' system and thanks to his brilliant performance plus support from local stars Cyrus Baguio, Sonny Thoss, JVee Casio, Calvin Abueva and sixth man Dondon Hontiveros, Alaska topped the standings with an 11–3 record at the end of the eliminations and gained twice to beat advantage in quarterfinal round. They beat Air21 in the quarterfinals to face San Mig Coffee in the semis, setting up an attempt to finally beat former Alaska long-time coach Tim Cone. San Mig won Game 1 on a Bowles game winner but Alaska regained the  momentum as they won the last three games to advance to the Finals against Barangay Ginebra.  They swept the Kings in three lopsided games to win the 2013 Commissioner's Cup trophy. This was the 14th championship for the Aces and the first one without their long-time coach, Tim Cone. Rob Dozier was the run-away Best Import of the Conference, while Sonny Thoss was minted the Finals MVP.\n\nIn the Governor's Cup, Alaska tapped former New Mexico State standout Wendell McKines as import. Though McKines was consistent in the tournament by averaging a 30 point-20-rebounds every game, Alaska struggled during the conference but was good enough to qualify in the Playoffs with four wins in nine outings. They faced San Mig Coffee, which has a twice-to-beat advantage. The Aces came back from a 15-point deficit in the first game to force a do-or-die match-up but lost in the second game, bowing out of the Governor's Cup. During the Finals, Alaska rookie Calvin Abueva was named the Rookie Of The Year and included in the PBA Mythical First Team. Guard Cyrus Baguio and Center Sonny Thoss was included in the Mythical Second Team while JVee Casio won the Sportsmanship Award.\n\nOn November 12, 2013, the PBA Press Corps awarded Luigi Trillo as the Coach of the Year for the 2012–13 Season beating Grand Slam coaches Norman Black of Talk N' Text and former Alaska head coach Tim Cone of the San Mig Coffee Mixers. Trillo steered Alaska from a lottery team in 2011–12 to a title contender last season. Rookie of the Year Calvin Abueva was named in the All-Rookie Team along with Petron Blaze Boosters' Junemar Fajardo, Meralco Bolts' Cliff Hodge, San Mig Coffee Mixers' Alex Mallari and hotshot Chris Tiu of the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters.\n\n2013–14 Season: Trillo Out, Compton In\n\nLong-time Alaska Governor/Team Manager Joaqui Trillo announced his retirement effectively at the start of the 2013–14 PBA Season. Former Aces assistant coach Dickie Bachmann has been tapped as his replacement.\n\nIn the 2013 PBA Draft, Alaska used their 8th overall pick to select former Blue Eagle Ryan Buenafe, former FEU Tamaraw Chris \"Ping\" Exciminiano in the second round, and PBA D-League bigman Raymund Ilagan in the third round. The Aces traded their other second round pick to the Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters for a future second round pick as well. They also signed former ABL MVP Leo Avenido to bolster their lineup in the upcoming 2013–14 PBA Philippine Cup. The Aces managed to win 8 games in 14 outings and qualify for the playoffs as an eight seed and faced top-seeded Barangay Ginebra San Miguel, who has a twice-to-beat advantage. Alaska forced a do-or-die by taking Game 1 but fell short in Game 2, eliminating them in the process.\n\nIn the Commissioner's Cup, the Aces brought back reigning best import Robert Dozier, who helped Alaska snatch their 13th title the year before. They traded Aldrech Ramos to Air21 Express for bruiser Vic Manuel to beef up their frontline. The Aces had a 1–3 slow start but managed to win their remaining five games to earn the number 3 seed in the playoffs. They faced sixth seed San Mig Super Coffee Mixers in a best-of-three series. The Aces took Game 1 but lost Games 2 and 3 and again, they failed to enter the semifinals for the third straight conference.\n\nAlaska tapped former NBA player Bill Walker, who suited up for the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks as their reinforcement in the Governor's Cup. After splitting their first two games, Luigi Trillo stepped down as head coach of Alaska. Trillo, who was awarded as the PBA Coach of the Year in 2013, resigned because of \"family reasons\". With Trillo throwing the towel, team owner Wilfred Uytengsu appointed lead assistant Alex Compton as the team's new tactician. Alaska suffered its worst defeat in history, a 51-point deficit at the hands of the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters. Rumors sparkled that the team was being put on sale to newcomer NLEX Corp, who wanted to buy an existing franchise instead of starting from scratch. Team manager Dickie Bachmann shut down the rumors stating the team was \"here to stay.\" Uytengsu also denied the rumors and stated that he was not selling the franchise with the second-most wins in the PBA. He called the reports as \"silly and laughable\". The following week, Alaska extended the contracts of main core players Cyrus Baguio, Sonny Thoss and JVee Casio for another three years. The Aces finished the conference with a 5–4 record making them the third seed and earning a twice-to-beat advantage in the playoffs. They eliminated crowd favorite Barangay Ginebra San Miguel in the quarterfinals, 92–81. The Aces entered the semifinals and faced the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters. Despite leading the series two games to one, the Aces lost the series in five grueling games and finished third place in the tournament.\n\n2014–15 Season: The birth of The Comeback Kids and #WeNotMe\n\nIn the 2014 PBA draft, Alaska used the 5th overall pick to select Filipino-Italian guard Chris Banchero, who led the San Miguel Beermen to a championship in the ABL, and in the second round, they drafted San Beda stalwart Rome dela Rosa. The Aces also traded two future second round picks to Global Port Batang Pier in exchange for former PBA MVP Eric Menk. In their preparations for the upcoming season, they hired Rob Beveridge, a well-known successful coach in the Australian Basketball League to improve the team's performance focusing on defense. After signing their rookies Banchero and Dela Rosa to their respective contracts, they also signed veteran swingman Josh Vanlandingham from the free agent market.\nThey started the season 6–0 atop of the standings in the Philippine Cup  but suffered their first loss at the hands of Barako Bull. After winning a road game against GlobalPort in Cagayan de Oro City, they were denied of an outright semi-finals berth after losing two crucial games against Barangay Ginebra and Rain or Shine, respectively. Yet, they still earn a twice-to-beat advantage in the Quarterfinals. After demolishing NLEX in their quarterfinal matchup, the Aces faced Meralco Bolts in the knockout phase and won the game in a blowout fashion to set a rematch with Rain or Shine Elasto Painters in a best-of-seven semi-finals series. They finished the series in six games to face San Miguel in the Finals for their 27th finals appearance. They battled the Beermen in seven gruelling games before eventually lost Game 7 by two points.\n\nAlaska tapped D.J. Covington as their import for the Commissioner's Cup. After four games, he was replaced by Damion James. They also traded bruising forward Gabby Espinas to GlobalPort for defensive center Nonoy Baclao. Even with James as their reinforcement, the Aces could not come up with winning streaks, owing to injuries to key players Abueva, Casio, and Thoss. They recorded a 5–6 win loss record after the eliminations. Somehow, they punched a ticket to the Quarterfinals as the No. 6 seed after beating Barangay Ginebra in their last game, to set up a match with Purefoods, who eventually swept them in the Quarterfinal rounds.\n\nIn the Governors' Cup, the Aces acquired the services of Romeo Travis, LeBron James' childhood friend and high school teammate at St. Vincent-St. Mary.

Since then, they won four straight to clinch the top spot in the elimination round with 8–3 win–loss record, although they dropped their last game to GlobalPort.  They easily deposed Barangay Ginebra in the quarterfinal rounds to set up a semis showdown against Star Hotshots.  They swept the Hotshots, 3–0 and earned a ticket to the Finals for their 28th finals appearance.  They set up a rematch against San Miguel, who eventually swept them, 4–0.\n\n2015–16 season: Drive for 15th continues\n\nThe Aces drafted Letran standout Kevin Racal with the 11th pick in the rookie draft, as well as big man Marion Magat and crafty guard Abel Galliguez. During the offseason, Alaska allowed Calvin Abueva, Sonny Thoss, Dondon Hontiveros and Coach Alex Compton join the Gilas Pilipinas 3.0 national team, who won silver medals in both the 2015 William Jones Cup and 2015 FIBA Asia Championship.\n\nOn November 12, 2015, The PBA franchise celebrated their 30th anniversary with the recognition night for the 30 greatest players in the team's history held in the Enderun College, Taguig.\n\nAlaska was consistent all throughout the All-Filipino eliminations, thanks to their intact lineup, team play and suffocating defense, they won nine out of their eleven outings. The Aces earned the number one spot in the standings, hence, giving them an outright semifinals berth. Alaska faced the GlobalPort Batang Pier in the semi-finals. After losing the first game, the Aces won their next four outings to clinch the first seat in the 2015–16 PBA Philippine Cup Finals and set up last year's finals rematch against the San Miguel Beermen.\n\nThe Aces won the 1st 3 games of the series and was on the verge of winning the championship after leading by 11 points with less than 4 minutes remaining in the pivotal Game 4. However, the Aces would be denied to win the championship blowing a 3–0 lead by the combined efforts of former Aces player, Gabby Espinas, sharpshooter Marcio Lassiter and defensive stalwart, Chris Ross. Alaska suffered the most disappointing finals ever when the Beermen took the last four games and win the championship.\n\nAlaska once again tapped former Best Import Robert Dozier for the Commissioner's Cup. However, Dozier got injured before the start of the season during practice. With their import sidelined by plantar fasciitis, backup reinforcement Shane Edwards filled in and provided good numbers and led the Aces to five wins in eight outings. Dozier returned three games before the end of the eliminations and the Aces finished third in the standings to qualify for the playoffs. Alaska beat Tropang TNT in the quarterfinals in a do-or-die best of three series. The Aces will look for a third consecutive PBA Finals trip as they face the Meralco Bolts in the semifinals. The Aces bested the Bolts in 5 grueling games to face the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters in the Finals. Alaska, hampered by injuries, missed the services of key players JVee Casio and Vic Manuel during the championship series. Despite being down by 0–3 in the finals, Alaska managed to forced the series in six games before losing their third consecutive finals.\n\nThe Aces tapped LaDontae Henton as their reinforcement for the Governor's Cup. Vic Manuel and JVee Casio returns for Alaska after healing off injuries. On July 14, 2016, after a six-year tenure with Alaska,Cyrus Baguio was traded to the Phoenix Fuel Masters for two second round picks. The Aces decided to trade Baguio due to the emergence of rookie Kevin Racal.\n\nAlaska struggled at the start of the season winning only two matches in five outings even losing to an import-less team San Miguel but went on to a four-game winning streak. The team treated their final outings in the eliminations as \"knock out games\". On September 16, 2016, Banchero, again, extended his tenure with the Aces. This time, to a longer three-year deal. Terms were not disclosed. The Fil-Italian cager stated that it was an \"easy decision\" stating \"he is very happy with Alaska.\" He credited the coaching staff and his teammates as the main reason he stayed with the team and hopes he will finish his career with Alaska. The Aces scored an important win in their last game of the eliminations in the season-ending conference to clinch the number six spot by beating the NLEX Road Warriors. Vic Manuel came back from his injury and contributed immediately and faced crowd darling Barangay Ginebra in the playoffs. However, the Aces failed to force a do-or-die game to advance in the semi-finals.\n\nAlaska drafted former FEU bruiser and current Gilas Pilipinas pool member Carl Bryan Cruz during the 2016 PBA Special Draft. They started the 2016–17 PBA Philippine Cup with key players Sonny Thoss, Calvin Abueva and Noy Baclao in the injured list forcing Cruz, sophomore stretch player Jaypee Mendoza and Marion Magat playing at the center slot. Due to lack of size, the Aces lost their first two games and initiated a deal to send swing man Rome dela Rosa to Star Hotshots in exchange for former San Beda teammate big man Jake Pascual. Pascual immediately contributed to the team with his scrappy plays and defense and with Abueva and Manuel returning to top form, Alaska won its next three games. Despite finishing second in the standings and gaining a twice-to-beat advantage, the Aces, hampered by injuries, failed to enter the semi-finals when they lost two in a row to Barangay Ginebra.\n\n2016–17 season\nIn 2016–17, a week after their Philippine Cup campaign, Alaska traded back up point guard RJ Jazul to the Phoenix Fuel Masters in exchange for guard Simon Enciso.\n\n2017–18 season\nIn the Governor's Cup that year, they went up to the Finals, but lost to Magnolia Hotshots.\n\n2021 season: final season\nOn February 16, 2022, Alaska Milk Corporation (AMC) announced that the Alaska Aces will leave the PBA at the end of the 2021 Governors' Cup. This was due to a directive by FrieslandCampina, parent company of AMC. Alaska ended their last tournament with a loss to the NLEX Road Warriors in the quarterfinals. Immediately following their last game on March 19, 2022, a brief ceremony was held to mark the Alaska's departure from the PBA.\n\nFranchise's sale to Converge ICT\nSeveral companies expressed interest to buy the Aces' franchise. This included Universal Canning, Inc. and Converge ICT which is associated to businessman Dennis Anthony Uy (not to be confused and also not related with namesake Dennis Uy who owned the Phoenix Super LPG Fuel Masters).\n\nThe prospect company could retain the core of the Alaska Aces team if they bought the franchise within the ongoing season. In the event the franchise is not sold within the ongoing season, the PBA would place the players in a dispersal draft.\n\nOn March 23, 2022, the PBA announced the sale of the franchise to Converge ICT with unanimous approval by the leagues' Board of Governors.\n\nMascot\n\nE. Cow was the main mascot of the Alaska Aces. He was first introduced during the mid-1990s and was the longest tenured PBA mascot. His image was also used for Alaska Milk advertisements.\n\nFinal roster\n\n  also serves as Alaska's board governor.\n\nSeason-by-season records\n\nRecords from the 2021 PBA season:\n*one-game playoffs**team had the twice-to-beat advantage\n\nAwards\n\nIndividual awards\n\nPBA Press Corps Individual Awards\n\nAll-Star Weekend\n\nNotable players\n\nMembers of the PBA's 25 greatest players\nJohnny Abarrientos – \"The Flying A\" played for team from 1993 to 2000; led Alaska to numerous PBA titles and was the 1996 PBA Most Valuable Player\nBogs Adornado – played for Hills Bros. in the 1987 season; became the team's head coach after his retirement\nKenneth Duremdes – \"Captain Marbel\" played for the team from 1998 to 2003; led Alaska to four PBA titles and was the 1998 PBA Most Valuable Player\nAbet Guidaben – played for the team from 1989 to 1990 before being traded to Pepsi for Harmon Codiñera.\nJojo Lastimosa – \"The 4th Quarter Man\" \"Mr.Clutch\" \"The Helicopter\" led Alaska to nine PBA titles and was named to numerous Mythical Team selections,10-time PBA All-Star,1988 PBA Rookie of the Year and 1996 PBA All Filipino Cup Finals MVP.\n\nAlaska Aces 30 greatest players\nOn November 12, 2015, the Alaska Aces celebrated its 30th anniversary.\n\nJohnny Abarrientos\nJojo Lastimosa\nBong Hawkins\nJeffrey Cariaso\nSean Chambers\nYoyoy Villamin\nKenneth Duremdes\nWillie Miller\nBiboy Ravanes\nWillie Pearson\nBoy Cabahug\nPoch Juinio\nTony Dela Cruz\nLA Tenorio\nCalvin Abueva\nRob Dozier\nJV Casio\nPaul Alvarez\nRodney Santos\nRic-Ric Marata\nDevin Davis\nDiamon Simpson\nReynel Hugnatan\nMike Cortez\nEugene Quilban\nSonny Thoss\nCyrus Baguio\nDondon Hontiveros\nRey Lazaro\nAli Peek\nRossell Ellis\n\nMVP awardee while still with the team\nJohnny Abarrientos – 1996\nKenneth Duremdes – 1998\nWillie Miller – 2007\n\nROY awardee while still with the team\nEugene Quilban – 1991\nJeffrey Cariaso – 1995\nCalvin Abueva – 2013\n\nTeam captains\nFrankie Lim (1986–1987)\nWilliam \"Bogs\" Adornado (1987–1988)\nYoyoy Villamin (1988–1991)\nJojo Lastimosa (1991–1999)\nJohnny Abarrientos (1993–2001)\nKenneth Duremdes (2001–2003)\nJohn Arigo (2003–2004)\nJeffrey Cariaso (2004–2010)\nTony dela Cruz (2010–2016)\nDondon Hontiveros (2013–2016, co-captain with Tony Dela Cruz)\nCalvin Abueva (2016–2018, co-captain with JVee Casio and RJ Jazul before Jazul left the team in 2017)\nRJ Jazul (2016–2017, was co-captain with JVee Casio and Calvin Abueva)\nJVee Casio (2016–2021)\nJeron Teng (2021–present)\n\nRetired numbers\n\n  – retired during the opening of the 2003 season\n  – retired during halftime of the 2021 PBA Governors' Cup\n  – retired during the Alaska 25th anniversary reunion last September 27, 2010\n  – retired after Chambers announced his retirement in the 2001 Governor's Cup\n  – retired during the semifinals of the 2010 PBA Fiesta Conference\n  – retired during the opening ceremonies of the 1988 PBA season\n  – honored during halftime of the 2017 PBA Commissioner's Cup\n  – honored during halftime of the 2018 PBA Commissioner's Cup\n\nCoaches\n Tony Vasquez (1986)\n Cesar Jota (1986)\n Nat Canson (1987)\n Turo Valenzona (1987–1988)\n Bogs Adornado (1988–1989)\n Tim Cone (1989–2011)\n Joel Banal (2011–2012)\n Luigi Trillo (2012–2014)\n Alex Compton (2014–2019)\n Jeffrey Cariaso (2019–2022)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMYPBA.com thread: Alaska Origins, History and Trivias\n\n \nBasketball teams established in 1986\n1986 establishments in the Philippines\n2022 disestablishments in the Philippines\nBasketball teams disestablished in 2022\nDefunct Philippine Basketball Association teams"}

Later, he obtained a master's degree in the same discipline in Switzerland.\n\nReturned to Turkey, he worked in the Sabancı Holding and soon founded and further developed the synthetic fibres producer Sasa, one of the biggest industrial companies of the group. Under his leadership, Sabancı Holding entered into the automotive sector. He established several joint-venture projects with major Japanese companies including production of Mitsubishi coaches and trucks, Komatsu construction equipment, loaders and forklifts.

It was largely destroyed during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, but was used during the occupation of Japan as a radar base by the Royal Australian Air Force 111 Mobile Fighter Control Unit, and through the 1950s as a landing field for gliders and single-engine piston aircraft.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the Japanese government approved a plan for a new airport in a location which could take advantage of Hiroshima's natural river topography to keep aircraft from flying over residential areas. Hiroshima Airport opened on September 15, 1961, and was initially managed by the Ministry of Transport.\n\nThe runway was extended from 1200 meters to 1800 meters in 1972. All Nippon Airways began Boeing 737 jet service to the airport in 1979, followed by Boeing 767 service in 1983. Further extensions were necessary to support large jet service, and the airport's location made this impossible. A new Hiroshima Airport was built outside the city in 1993. The old Hiroshima Airport was then renamed Hiroshima–Nishi Airport and fell under the control of Hiroshima Prefecture.\n\nJ-Air was based at Hiroshima–Nishi from 1991 until 2005, originally as a division of the JAL Flight Academy, and provided commuter service to domestic airports using Jetstream 31 and then Bombardier CRJ-200 aircraft. Japan Air Commuter continued to offer commuter service using Saab 340 aircraft since then until 2010, when the service was terminated as part of the corporate restructuring of its parent company Japan Airlines. Some air taxi services also operated until early 2013 when the airport ceased all operations.\n\nHiroshima City and Hiroshima Prefecture officials debated the future of the airport for several years in the early 2000s. City officials sought to keep the airport open in order to boost the city's economy, while prefectural officials preferred converting the southern part of the property into a heliport and building an extension of the Hiroshima South Road through the northern part. Following JAC's withdrawal from the airport, Hiroshima City legislators proposed converting the airport into a municipal airport. The ordinance proposal was rejected by the city assembly in March 2011, and a new mayor announced in May that the airport would be converted to a heliport by 2012, in line with the prefecture's original proposal. However, this plan seems to be stalled as of early 2015, though some progress had been made up to 2013. From 2014, there was a strictly limited daily time window for helicopter services to be operated out of the former airport.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nDefunct airports in Japan\nTransport in Hiroshima Prefecture\nBuildings and structures in Hiroshima\nAirports established in 1961\nAirports disestablished in 1993\nAirports disestablished in 2012\n1961 establishments in Japan\n1993 disestablishments in Japan\n2012 disestablishments in Japan"}

The second batch of 50 cars (25 sets) had hydraulic transmissions, and became Class 113s.\n\nThe cars were built for services in the LMR Central Division and in the Liverpool - St Helens area, where the gradients in the Lancashire & Yorkshire area required more power. Both types also spent some time working from Cricklewood.\n\nThe gross weight of a set with all seats occupied was approximately 70 tons, giving  per ton.

The basic problem occurred when a unit being driven automatically (Class 113) failed to mesh with a unit that could not be driven automatically (most Blue Square types). The latter units tended to catch fire. If such a pairing occurred, the driver of the automatically driven unit was supposed to drive it as if it were a mechanical transmission unit, so the two units gears would work together.  \n\nIf an automatic transmission unit was driven from a mechanical transmission unit the problem did not occur, as the automatic drive unit would change gears as if it was a mechanical drive unit. The Class 112 and 113 units looked similar and one assumes this led to the driving errors. By changing Class 113 to Red Triangle, the incompatible coupling should not occur.\n\nWithdrawal\n\nAll Class 112s and 113s were withdrawn and subsequently scrapped between 1968 and 1969.\n\nReferences\n\nThe Railcar Association\nMotive Power Recognition: 3 DMUs.

{"id": "4047871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexachlorobenzene", "title": "Hexachlorobenzene", "text": "Hexachlorobenzene, or perchlorobenzene, is an organochloride with the molecular formula C6Cl6. It is a fungicide formerly used as a seed treatment, especially on wheat to control the fungal disease bunt. It has been banned globally under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.\n\nPhysical and chemical properties\nHexachlorobenzene is a stable, white, crystalline chlorinated hydrocarbon. It is sparingly soluble in organic solvents such as benzene, diethyl ether and alcohol, but practically insoluble in water with no reaction. It has a flash point of 468 °F and it is stable under normal temperatures and pressures. It is combustible but it does not ignite readily. When heated to decomposition, hexachlorobenzene emits highly toxic fumes of hydrochloric acid, other chlorinated compounds (such as phosgene), carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.\n\nHistory\nHexachlorobenzene was first known as \"Julin's chloride of carbon\" as it was discovered as a strange and unexpected product of impurities reacting in Julin's nitric acid factory. In 1864, Hugo Müller synthesised the compound by the reaction of benzene and antimony pentachloride, he then suggested that his compound was the same as Julin's chloride of carbon. Müller previously also believed it was the same compound as Michael Faraday's \"perchloride of carbon\" and obtained a small sample of Julin's chloride of carbon to send Richard Phillips and Faraday for investigation. In 1867, Henry Bassett proved that those were the same compounds and named it hexachlorobenzene\".\n\nLeopold Gmelin named it \"dichloride of carbon\" and claimed that the carbon was derived from cast iron and the chlorine was from crude saltpetre.\n\nVictor Regnault obtained hexachlorobenzene from the decomposition of chloroform and tetrachloroethylene vapours through a red-hot tube.\n\nSynthesis\nHexachlorobenzene has been made on a laboratory scale since the 1890s, by the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of chlorine with benzene or chlorobenzenes. Large-scale manufacture for use as a fungicide was developed by using the residue remaining after purification of the mixture of isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane, from which the insecticide lindane (the γ-isomer) had been removed, leaving the unwanted α- and β- isomers. This mixture is produced when benzene is reacted with chlorine in the presence of ultraviolet light (e.g. from sunlight).\n\nUsage\nHexachlorobenzene was used in agriculture to control the fungus tilletia caries (common bunt of wheat). It is also effective on tilletia controversa, dwarf bunt. The compound was introduced in 1947, normally formulated as a seed dressing but is now banned in many countries.\n\nSafety\n\nHexachlorobenzene is an animal carcinogen and is considered to be a probable human carcinogen. After its introduction as a fungicide in 1945, for crop seeds, this toxic chemical was found in all food types. Hexachlorobenzene was banned from use in the United States in 1966.\n\nThis material has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic to humans). Animal carcinogenicity data for hexachlorobenzene show increased incidences of liver, kidney (renal tubular tumours) and thyroid cancers. Chronic oral exposure in humans has been shown to give rise to a liver disease (porphyria cutanea tarda), skin lesions with discoloration, ulceration, photosensitivity, thyroid effects, bone effects and loss of hair. Neurological changes have been reported in rodents exposed to hexachlorobenzene. Hexachlorobenzene may cause embryolethality and teratogenic effects. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that hexachlorobenzene crosses the placenta to accumulate in foetal tissues and is transferred in breast milk.\n\nHCB is very toxic to aquatic organisms. It may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic environment. Therefore, release into waterways should be avoided. It is persistent in the environment. Ecological investigations have found that biomagnification up the food chain does occur. Hexachlorobenzene has a half life in the soil of between 3 and 6 years. Risk of bioaccumulation in an aquatic species is high.\n\nToxicology\n Oral LD50 (rat): 10,000 mg/kg\n Oral LD50 (mice): 4,000 mg/kg\n Inhalation LC50 (rat): 3600 mg/m3\nMaterial has relatively low acute toxicity but is toxic because of its persistent and cumulative nature in body tissues in rich lipid content.\n\nUnique Exposure Incident\nIn Anatolia, Turkey between 1955 and 1959, during a period when bread wheat was unavailable, 500 people were fatally poisoned and more than 4,000 people fell ill by eating bread made with HCB-treated seed that was intended for agriculture use. Most of the sick were affected with a liver condition called porphyria cutanea tarda, which disturbs the metabolism of hemoglobin and results in skin lesions. Almost all breastfeeding children under the age of two, whose mothers had eaten tainted bread, died from a condition called \"pembe yara\" or \"pink sore\", most likely from high doses of HCB in the breast milk. In one mother's breast milk the HCB level was found to be 20 parts per million in lipid, approximately 2,000 times the average levels of contamination found in breast-milk samples around the world. Follow-up studies 20 to 30 years after the poisoning found average HCB levels in breast milk were still more than seven times the average for unexposed women in that part of the world (56 specimens of human milk obtained from mothers with porphyria, average value was 0.51 ppm in HCB-exposed patients compared to 0.07 ppm in unexposed controls), and 150 times the level allowed in cow's milk.\n\nIn the same follow-up study of 252 patients (162 males and 90 females, avg. current age of 35.7 years), 20–30 years' postexposure, many subjects had dermatologic, neurologic, and orthopedic symptoms and signs. The observed clinical findings include scarring of the face and hands (83.7%), hyperpigmentation (65%), hypertrichosis (44.8%), pinched faces (40.1%), painless arthritis (70.2%), small hands (66.6%), sensory shading (60.6%), myotonia (37.9%), cogwheeling (41.9%), enlarged thyroid (34.9%), and enlarged liver (4.8%). Urine and stool porphyrin levels were determined in all patients, and 17 have at least one of the porphyrins elevated. Offspring of mothers with three decades of HCB-induced porphyria appear normal.\n\nSee also\nChlorobenzenes—different numbers of chlorine substituents\nPentachlorobenzenethiol\n\nReferences\nCited works\n\nAdditional references\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer.

{"id": "4047930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%20disorganization%20theory", "title": "Social disorganization theory", "text": "In sociology, the social disorganization theory is a theory developed by the Chicago School, related to ecological theories. The theory directly links crime rates to neighbourhood ecological characteristics; a core principle of social disorganization theory that states location matters. In other words, a person's residential location is a substantial factor shaping the likelihood that that person will become involved in illegal activities. The theory suggests that, among determinants of a person's later illegal activity, residential location is as significant as or more significant than the person's individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, or race). For example, the theory suggests that youths from disadvantaged neighborhoods participate in a subculture which approves of delinquency, and that these youths thus acquire criminality in this social and cultural setting.\n\nLarry Gaines and Roger Miller state in their book Criminal Justice in Action that \"crime is largely a product of unfavorable conditions in certain communities\". According to the social disorganization theory, there are ecological factors that lead to high rates of crime in these communities, and these factors linked to constantly elevated levels of \"high school dropouts, unemployment, deteriorating infrastructures, and single-parent homes\" (Gaines and Miller). The theory is not intended to apply to all types of crime, just street crime at the neighborhood level. The theory has not been used to explain organized crime, corporate crime, or deviant behavior that takes place outside neighborhood settings.\n\nUp to the beginning of 1970s, this theory took a back seat to the psychological explanation of crime. A recent overview of social disorganization theory, including suggestions for refining and extending the theory, is a journal article by Kubrin and Weitzer (2003).\n\nPark and Burgess\nRobert E. Park and Ernest Burgess (1925) developed a theory of urban ecology which proposed that cities are environments like those found in nature, governed by many of the same forces of Darwinian evolution; i.e. competition, which affects natural ecosystems. When a city is formed and grows, people and their activities cluster in a particular area (this is the process of \"concentration\"). Gradually, this central area becomes highly populated, so there is a scattering of people and their activities away from the central city to establish the suburbs (this is \"dispersion\").\n\nThey suggested that, over time, the competition for land and other scarce urban resources leads to the division of the urban space into distinctive ecological niches, \"natural areas\" or zones in which people share similar social characteristics because they are subject to the same ecological pressures. As a zone becomes more prosperous and \"desirable\", property values and rents rise, and people and businesses migrate into that zone, usually moving outward from the city center in a process Park and Burgess called \"succession\" (a term borrowed from plant ecology), and new residents take their place.\n\nAt both a micro and macro level, society was thought to operate as a super organism, where change is a natural aspect of the process of growth, and is neither chaotic nor disorderly. Thus, an organized area is invaded by new elements. This gives rise to local competition, and there will either be succession or an accommodation which results in a reorganization. But, during the early stages of competition, there will always be some level of disorganization because there will be disruption to (or breakdowns in) the normative structure of the community, which may or may not lead to deviant behavior. Thus, although a city was a physical organization, it also had social and moral structures that could be disorganized.\n\nTheir model—known as concentric zone model and first published in The City (1925)—predicted that, once fully grown, cities would take the form of five concentric rings, with areas of social and physical deterioration concentrated near the city center and more prosperous areas located near the city's edge. This theory seeks to explain the existence of social problems such as unemployment and crime in specific Chicago districts, making extensive use of synchronic mapping to reveal the spatial distribution of social problems and to permit comparison between areas. They argued that \"neighborhood conditions, be they of wealth or poverty, had a much greater determinant effect on criminal behavior than ethnicity, race, or religion\" (Gaines and Miller). In the post-war period, the cartographic approach was criticized as simplistic in that it neglected the social and cultural dimensions of urban life, the political and economic impact of industrialization on urban geography, and the issues of class, race, gender, and ethnicity.\n\nSutherland\nEdwin Sutherland adopted the concept of social disorganization to explain the increases in crime that accompanied the transformation of preliterate and peasant societies—in which \"influences surrounding a person were steady, uniform, harmonious and consistent\"—to modern Western civilization, which he believed was characterized by inconsistency, conflict, and un-organization (1934: 64). He also believed that the mobility, economic competition, and individualistic ideology that accompanied capitalist and industrial development had been responsible for the disintegration of the large family and homogeneous neighborhoods as agents of social control. The failure of extended kin groups expanded the realm of relationships no longer controlled by the community and undermined governmental controls, leading to persistent \"systematic\" crime and delinquency.\n\nSutherland also believed that such disorganization causes and reinforces the cultural traditions and cultural conflicts that support antisocial activity. The systematic quality of the behavior was a reference to repetitive, patterned, or organized offending, as opposed to random events. He depicted the law-abiding culture as dominant and more extensive than alternative criminogenic cultural views, and as capable of overcoming systematic crime if organized for that purpose (1939: 8). But because society is organized around individual and small group interests, society permits crime to persist. Sutherland concluded that if the society is organized with reference to the values expressed in the law, the crime is eliminated; if it is not organized, crime persists and develops (1939:8).\n\nIn later works, Sutherland switched from the concept of social disorganization to differential social organization to convey the complexity of overlapping and conflicting levels of organization in a society.\n\nCavan\nIn 1928, Ruth Shonle Cavan produced Suicide, a study of personal disorganization in which she confirmed that the mortality rate is relatively stable, regardless of economic and social conditions. Despite finding this result, Cavan was excluded from faculty status at Chicago. She served on various research committees for six years, and then moved to Rockford College in Illinois.\n\nShe was particularly interested in dance halls, brothels, insanity, divorce, nonvoting, suicide, and other forms of socially problematic behavior of interest to the political reformers, studying the working lives of \"business\" girls and their dispersal throughout the zones of Chicago (1929). Partly as a result of her studies, Cavan (1953) emphasized the importance to the efficient functioning of the entire social order of the regulation of sex. While there are variations in the specific arrangements, all societies contain family groups, forbid incest, sanction marriage, approve more highly of legitimate than of illegitimate births, and look upon marriage as the most highly approved outlet for sexual expression of adults.\n\nShe has continued the work to review delinquency in different countries (1968), returning to write of the Chicago School itself in 1983.\n\nShaw and McKay\nMapping can also show spatial distributions of delinquency and crime, but it cannot explain the results. Indeed, such research has often been used politically to ascribe immorality to specific population groups or ethnicities. Social disorganization theory and cultural transmission theory examine the consequences when a community is unable to conform to common values and to solve the problems of its residents.\n\nClifford Shaw and Henry D. McKay (1942) applied Sutherland's theory of systematic criminal behavior, and claimed that delinquency was not caused at the individual level, but is a normal response by normal individuals to abnormal conditions. Thus, if a community is not self-policing and if it is imperfectly policed by outside agencies, some individuals will exercise unrestricted freedom to express their dispositions and desires, often resulting in delinquent behavior. They considered the concentric zone model, and produced a diachronic analysis to demonstrate that delinquency was already dispersed in urban areas, and that more wealthy and important groups moved to avoid the existing social disorganization.\n\nTheir concepts, hypothesis, and research methods have been a strong influence on the analysis of delinquency and crime. Their dependent variables in the delinquency rates were measured by arrests, court appearances, and court adjudications of institutional commitment. Their independent variables were economic conditions by square-mile areas, ethnic heterogeneity, and population turnover. These variables were based on where delinquents lived and consisted of 10- to 16-year-old males who were petitioned to juvenile court (56,000 juvenile court records from 1900–1933 were used as data). The time frames they selected showed strong patterns of immigrant migration; Shaw and McKay believed that they could demonstrate whether delinquency was caused by particular immigrant groups or by the environment in which the immigrants lived:\n\nIf high delinquency rates for particular immigrant groups remained high during their migration through the city's different ecological environments, then delinquency could be associated with their distinctive constitutional or cultural features.\nIf delinquency rates decreased as immigrants moved through different ecological environments, then delinquency could not be associated with the particular constitution of the immigrants, but must somehow be connected with their environment.\n\nShaw and McKay demonstrated that social disorganization was endemic to the urban areas which were the only places the newly arriving poor could afford to live. In these areas, there was a high rate of turnover in the population (residential instability), and mixes of people from different cultural backgrounds (ethnic diversity). Shaw and McKay's analyses relating delinquency rates to these structural characteristics established key facts about the community correlates of crime and delinquency:\n\nThe rates of juvenile delinquency were consistent with an ordered spatial pattern, with the highest rates in the inner-city areas, and the rates declining as distance from the city center increases.\nThere was an identical spatial pattern revealed by various other indexes of social problems.\nThe spatial pattern of delinquency rates showed significant long-term stability, even though the nationality structure of the population in the inner-city areas changed greatly throughout the decades.\nWithin inner-city areas, the course of becoming delinquent occurred through a network of interpersonal relationships, involving family, gangs, and the neighborhood.\n\nComparing the maps, Shaw and McKay recognized that the pattern of delinquency rates corresponded to the \"natural urban areas\" of Park and Burgess' concentric zone model. This evidenced the conclusion that delinquency rates always remained high for a certain region of the city (ecological zone 2), no matter which immigrant group lived there. Hence, delinquency was not \"constitutional\", but was to be correlated with the particular ecological environment in which it occurs. In this context, Shaw and McKay asserted that ethnic diversity interferes with communication among adults, with effective communication less likely in the face of ethnic diversity because differences in customs and a lack of shared experiences may breed fear and mistrust.\n\nAlthough research in different countries has tended to support Shaw and McKay's findings that delinquent rates are highest in areas with economic decline and instability, that research has not found that crime rates spatially disperse from the city center outward. In fact, in some countries, the wealthy live in city centers, while the poorest zones are near city fringes. Further, their work does not consider why there is significant non-delinquency in delinquency areas. Thus, the theory identifies social causes of delinquency that seem to be located in specific geographical areas, but its conclusions are not completely generalizable. For a general discussion of their work, see Snodgrass (1976).\n\nShaw and McKay's Chicago Area Project is an example of practicing public criminology.\n\nFaris\nRobert E. Lee Faris (1955) extended the concept of social disorganization to explain social pathologies and social problems in general, including crime, suicide, mental illness, and mob violence. Defining organization as definite and enduring patterns of complementary relations (1955: 3), he defined social disorganization as the weakening or destruction of the relationships which hold together a social organization (1955: 81). Such a concept was to be employed objectively as a measurable state of a social system, independent of personal approval or disapproval. When applied to crime, Faris' central proposition was that, \"A crime rate is ...a reflection of the degree of disorganization of the control mechanisms in a society.\" In turn, crime also contributes to disorganization, and disorganization of such conventional mechanisms is especially likely in large, rapidly growing industrial cities where such disorganization permits highly organized criminality, as well as less organized forms of group and individual crime and delinquency.\n\nSampson\nRobert J. Sampson (1993) claims that any theory of crime must begin with the fact that most violent criminals belonged to teenage peer-groups, particularly street gangs, and that a gang member will become a full-time criminal if social controls are insufficient to address delinquent behaviour at an early age. He follows Shaw and McKay (1969) in accepting that, if the family and relatives offer inadequate supervision or incomplete socialization, children from broken families are more likely to join violent gangs, unless others take the parents' place. However, even children from unstable families are less likely to be influenced by peer groups in a community where most family units are intact. Tight-knit communities are more likely to identify strangers, report deviants to their parents, and pass warnings along. High rates of residential mobility and high-rise housing disrupt the ability to establish and maintain social ties. Formal organizations like schools, churches, and the police act as surrogates for family and friends in many communities, but poor, unstable communities often lack the organization and political connections to obtain resources for fighting crime and offering young people an alternative to deviant behavior. Sampson concludes that \"the empirical data suggest that the structural elements of social disorganization have relevance for explaining macro level variations in violence.\"\n\nSocial disorganisation may also produce crime by isolating communities from the mainstream culture. Sampson and Wilson (1995) proposed a theory of race and urban inequality to explain the disproportionate representation of African Americans as victims and offenders in violent crime. The basic idea proposed was that community-level patterns of racial inequality give rise to the social isolation and ecological concentration of the truly disadvantaged, which in turn leads to structural barriers and cultural adaptations that undermine social organisation and ultimately the control of crime. Sampson and Wilson (1995) pursued this logic to argue that the community-level causes of violence are the same for both whites and blacks, but that racial segregation by community differentially exposes members of minority groups to key violence-inducing and violence-protecting social mechanisms, thereby explaining black-white disparities in violence. Their thesis has come to be known as \"racial invariance\" in the fundamental causes of crime.\n\nBursik and Grasmick\nRobert J. Bursik Jr's scholarly works played an important role in the revival of Social Disorganization Theory following its fall in popularity during the 1960s. One of the main criticisms of Shaw and McKay's theory was that it suggested, in certain area's delinquency rates remained high regardless of the ethnicity group that lived there. Researchers during this period felt that it was unlikely that crime patterns remained stable even though there were constant changes in population without these areas. Bursik's work helped negate some of the criticisms associated with Shaw and McKay's work; Bursik showed that it was possible and likely to have stable crime patterns within an area that showed constant population change. Specifically Bursik points out that “development of primary relationships that result in informal structures of social control is less likely when local networks are in continual state of flux.” In the example of Chicago, as immigrants continue to come in, the population already there leave soon as it's financially feasible, which in return makes it difficult for any stable form of social control to take place.  \n\nRobert J. Bursik and Harold G. Grasmick further contributed to Social Disorganization Theory by reformulating concepts of social control within neighbourhoods that was introduced by Sampson and Groves, into three types of social control that are influenced by structural factors. Personal Social Control, Parochial Social Control and Public Social Control which are influenced by structural factors within a neighbourhood such as poverty, residential mobility, heterogeneity and broken homes affect the ability of the neighbourhood to implement models of social control.\n\nPersonal Social Control: In this model there are no personal relationships between neighbours and as a result no friendship networks for social control are formed. Example would be neighbourhoods with high number of residents with different race and backgrounds or low income and high unemployment which cause mistrust and lack of communication among the community.\nParochial Social Control: In this model the residents take a more active approach to Social Control observing strangers coming into the neighbourhood to stop vandalism and theft within the community. Example would be neighbourhoods that participate in programs like “Neighbourhood Watch”.\nPublic Social Control: In this model the entire community works together as an organization to improve and protect the community. Example would be playing an active role to the schools, community center and other institutions within the neighbourhood.\n\nLee and Martinez\nWhen scholars associated with Social Disorganization theory developed spatial analytical techniques seventy years ago, they wanted a way to study violent crimes. These theorists were particularly concerned about the adverse impacts of that immigration, and how internal migration and ethnic heterogeneity might impact the ability of neighborhoods to control the behavior of their residents. Shaw and McKay, Sampson and Groves and Bursik and Grasmick all suggest that immigration and ethnic heterogeneity within the neighborhood can have adverse effect within the community. Recent work by Matthew T. Lee and Ramiro Martinez JR, suggest that this might not always be the case; recent studies have found that immigration generally does not increase crime rates in areas in where immigrants settle; in fact some studies show that these areas are less involved in crime than natives. Lee and Martinez suggest that current immigration trends do not have the negative consequences expected by disorganization theories; rather these studies show that immigration can strengthen social control rather than compromise it. \n\nImmigration Revitalization argues that immigration can revitalize poor areas and strengthen social control within neighborhoods because of strong familial ties and job opportunities associated with enclave economies that result in less crime. In fact Lee and Martinez state that immigration is required as an essential ingredient for continued viability of urban areas where population has declined or community decay occurs, as was the case in previous decades.\n\nReferences\n\nBurgess, Ernest & Bogue, Donald J.

{"id": "4047933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churching%20of%20women", "title": "Churching of women", "text": "In Christian tradition the churching of women, also known as thanksgiving for the birth or adoption of a child, is the ceremony wherein a blessing is given to mothers after recovery from childbirth. The ceremony includes thanksgiving for the woman's survival of childbirth, and is performed even when the child is stillborn, or has died unbaptized.\n\nAlthough the ceremony itself contains no elements of ritual purification, it was related to Jewish practice as noted in , where women were purified after giving birth. In light of the New Testament, the Christian ritual draws on the imagery and symbolism of the presentation of Jesus at the Temple \n(). Although some Christian traditions consider Mary to have borne Christ without incurring impurity, she went to the Temple in Jerusalem to fulfil the requirements of the Law of Moses.\n\nThe rite is first mentioned in pseudo-Nicene Arabic canon law. The Christian rite for the churching of women continues in Eastern Christianity, the Lutheran Churches, the Anglican Communion and the Methodist Churches; but in the Roman Rite it is found only in the pre-Vatican II form and in Anglican Ordinariate parishes.\n\nHistory\nThe custom of blessing a woman after childbirth recalls the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary mentioned in Luke 2:22. The Jewish practice was based on Leviticus 12:1-8, which specified the ceremonial rite to be performed in order to restore ritual purity. It was believed that a woman becomes ritually unclean by giving birth owing to the presence of blood and/or other fluids at birth. This was part of ceremonial rather than moral law.\n\nNatalie Knödel noted that the idea that a woman who has recently given birth is to be set apart and then reintroduced into religious and social life by means of a special rite is not a specifically Western, let alone Christian, idea. Such rites are found in a number of cultures. All things having to do with birth and death are understood as somehow sacred. Paul V. Marshall suggests that in an agricultural society this could have been a simple means of protecting a new mother from resuming work too soon after giving birth. Enforced rest after childbirth is known as postpartum confinement. Historically, European women were confined to their beds or their homes for extensive periods after giving birth in a custom called lying-in; care was provided either by her female relatives (mother or mother-in-law) or by a temporary attendant known as a monthly nurse. \"Churching\" served to mark the end of these weeks of separation and reintegrate the new mother into her community.\n\nThe rite became the subject of a good deal of misunderstanding, since many commentators and preachers, in describing its scriptural antecedents, did not explain the concept clearly. Pope Gregory I as early as the 6th century protested against any notion that defilement was incurred by childbirth and recommended that women should never be separated from the church in case it was seen as such. As a blessing given to mothers after recovery from childbirth, \"it is not a precept, but a pious and praiseworthy custom, dating from the early Christian ages\".  David Cressy points out that the ceremony acknowledged the woman's labours and the perils of childbirth. At the conclusion of a month after childbirth, women looked forward to churching as a social occasion, and a time to celebrate with friends. For men it marked the end of a month during which they had to take care of the domestic affairs, commonly referred to as the \"gander month\". In thirteenth-century France the rite focused on the woman's role as wife and mother.\n\nThe Second Plenary Council of Baltimore, an American Roman-Catholic gathering held in October 1866, noted that churching after childbirth had been generally neglected in the United States and was to be insisted upon, and prohibited the practice of churching in places in which Mass is not celebrated.\n\nIn the West\n\nRoman Catholicism\nThe custom, referred to in many places as the \"Churching of Women\", was retained in the Church until very recent times, and still is in the old rite. The official title of the Rite was actually Benedictio mulieris post partum (the blessing of a woman after giving birth), and focused on blessing and thanksgiving. The rite largely fell into disuse in the late 1960s following the Second Vatican Council, but a number of traditional Catholic women still undergo the rite. The Book of Blessings published in 1984 contains a \"Blessing of a Woman after Childbirth\" that is significantly altered from the old rite used before the Council, but fulfills the same liturgical purpose. The current baptismal rite (which also incorporates a blessing of the father) contains a blessing for the mother, but the older rite is a special blessing.\n\nThe concluding prayer reads:\n\nThe \"Order for the Blessing of a Mother after Childbirth\" is still used, primarily for those mothers who were unable to attend the baptism, and is not necessarily held in a church. It may be imparted by a priest, deacon or authorized lay minister.\n\nLutheranism\n\nThe churching of women was historically offered to women in the Lutheran Church, taking place after the celebration of Holy Communion in the liturgy.\n\nA prayer \"For the Churching of Women\" as it appeared in the 1918 liturgy of The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, reads as follows:\n\nAnglicanism\nThe rite of the \"Churching of Women\" is offered in the Anglican Communion with a liturgy as part of the Book of Common Prayer.\n\nIn the US-based Episcopal Church, the \"Churching of Women\" is a liturgy for the purification or \"churching\" of women after childbirth, together with the presentation in church of the child. The 1979 Book of Common Prayer, avoiding any hint of ritual impurity, replaces the older rite with \"A Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child.\" The rite is to take place within the Sunday liturgy, after the intercessions, soon after the birth or adoption. In this service, parents and other family members come to the church with the newly born or adopted child \"to be welcomed by the congregation and to give thanks to Almighty God\" (Book of Common Prayer, p. 439).\n\nMethodism\nThe rite of the churching of women, officially known as the \"An Order of Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child\", continues to be offered in Methodist churches. The rubrics concerning the rite state:\n\nCustoms\n\nCustom differs, but the usual date of churching was the fortieth day after confinement (or giving birth), in accordance with the Biblical date and Jewish practice. The Purification of Mary and the presentation of Jesus at the Temple are commemorated forty days after Christmas.\n\nThe service included in the English Book of Common Prayer dates only from the Middle Ages. While the churching was normally performed by a priest in the parish church there were exceptions of women being churched at home. \n\nPrior to the English Reformation, according to the rubric the woman was to occupy the \"convenient place\" near the narthex. In the first prayer book of Edward VI of England, she was to be \"nigh unto the quire door\". In the second of his books, she was to be \"nigh unto the place where the Table (or altar) standeth\". Bishop Matthew Wren orders for the diocese of Norwich in 1636 were that women to be churched would come and kneel at a side near the communion table outside the rail, being veiled according to custom, and not covered with a hat. In some parishes there was a special pew known as the \"churching seat\". Conducting the ritual inside the church rather than on the porch is an outward sign that ritual impurity of a childbearing woman was no longer presumed.\n\nChurchings were formerly registered in some parishes. In Herefordshire it was not considered proper for the husband to appear in church at the service, or to sit with his wife in the same pew. The words in the rubric requiring the woman to come \"decently apparelled\", refer to the times when it was thought unbecoming for a woman to come to the service with the elaborate head-dress then the fashion. A veil was usually worn. In some parishes a special veil was provided by the church, for an inventory of goods belonging to St Benet Gracechurch in 1560 includes \"a churching cloth, fringed, white damask.\"\n\nIn pre-Reformation days, it was the custom in Catholic England for women to carry lighted tapers when being churched, an allusion to the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin (February 2), and also celebrated as Candlemas, the day chosen by the Catholic Church for the blessing of the candles for the whole year. At her churching, a woman was expected to make some votive offering to the church, such as the chrisom or alb placed on the child at its christening.\n\nAugustine Schulte described the ceremony in the early twentieth century: The mother, kneels in the vestibule, or within the church, carrying a lighted candle. The priest, vested in surplice and white stole, sprinkles her with holy water in the form of a cross. Having recited Psalm 24, \"The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof\", he offers her the left extremity of the stole and leads her into the church, saying: \"Enter thou into the temple of God, adore the Son of the Blessed Virgin Mary who has given thee fruitfulness of offspring.\" She advances to one of the altars and kneels before it, whilst the priest, turned towards her, recites the appropriate blessing, and then, having sprinkled her again with holy water in the form of the cross, dismisses her, saying: \"The peace and blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, descend upon thee, and remain forever. Amen.\" According to  commentary provided in a modern Catholic tutorial on the mass, the fact that the priest goes to meet the mother and escort her into the church is in itself a mark of respect for her.\n\nIt was formerly regarded as unwise for a woman to leave her house to go out at all after confinement until she went to be churched. In Anglo-Irish folk tradition, new mothers who had yet to be churched were regarded as attractive to the fairies, and so in danger of being kidnapped by them. However, the origin of the church ritual is unrelated to these later local superstitions, which accrued to it.\n\nIn the East\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine Rite, many jurisdictions still observe the tradition of the woman coming to church on the 40th day after childbirth for special blessings. For forty days a new mother remains at home to recuperate and to care for her child. However, if the child has not survived, the woman still remains at home to heal physically and emotionally. During the time of her confinement, the woman does not normally receive the eucharist, unless she is in danger of death. As the service is practiced in the Byzantine Rite, it involves both the blessing of the mother and the presentation of the child to God. The churching should be distinguished from two other brief rites that take place at childbirth: the Prayers on the First Day After Childbirth, and the Naming of the Child on the Eighth Day. These usually take place in the home. In some traditions, it is customary to baptize the child on the eighth day, following the example of the Old Testament rite of bris or circumcision of boys. In that case, the naming of the child would take place in the temple (church building); however, the mother would not attend, the child being presented by its godparents.\n\nChurching of the Woman\nOn the fortieth day after childbirth, the mother is brought to the temple to be churched; that is to say, to receive a blessing as she begins attending church and receiving the sacraments once again. The child (if it has survived) is brought by the mother, who has already been cleansed and washed, accompanied by the intended sponsors (Godparents) who will stand at the child's baptism. They all stand together in the narthex before the doors of the nave, facing east. The priest blesses them and says prayers for the woman and the child, giving thanks for their wellbeing and asking God's grace and blessings upon them.\n\nChurching of the Child\nThen, if the infant has already been baptized, he performs the churching of the child; if not, he does the churching immediately after the baptism.\n\nTaking up the child, the priest lifts it up, making the sign of the cross with the child before the doors of the temple, saying: \"The servant of God (Name) is churched, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\"\n\nHe then carries the child into the center of the nave, as he says, \"I will go into Thy House. I will worship toward Thy Holy Temple in fear of Thee.\" Stopping in the center, he says, \"The servant of God (Name) is churched, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. In the midst of the congregation I will sing praises unto Thee.\"\n\nHe then walks up to the iconostasis, and stopping in front of the royal doors, he says, \"The servant of God (Name) is churched, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\"\n\nHe then carries the baby into the sanctuary and around the back of the altar and out again onto the soleas.\n\nHe then chants the Nunc dimittis and says a special apolysis (dismissal), after which he blesses the child with the Sign of the Cross on its forehead, mouth and heart, and returns it to its mother.\n\nSee also \n\nAblution in Christianity\nHygiene in Christianity\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n A History of Women's Bodies, Edward Shorter, Penguin, New York, 1982\n\nExternal links\n Churching of Women in Liturgy and Agenda (Lutheran)  \n Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child in the 2019 Book of Common Prayer (Anglican)\n An Order of Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child in the Book of Worship (Methodist)\n Prayers for the Churching of a Mother and Child After Forty Days (Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America)\n The Churching of Women (Roman Catholic) \n 1552 Book of Common Prayer \"The Thankes Geuing of Women After Childe Birth, Commonly Called the Churchyng Of Women.\"\n The Thanksgiving of Women after Childbirth historical account\n\nLutheran sacraments and rites\nCatholic liturgy\nByzantine Rite\nAnglican liturgy\nMethodism\nChristianity and women"}
{"id": "4047952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirex", "title": "Mirex", "text": "Mirex is an organochloride that was commercialized as an insecticide and later banned because of its impact on the environment. This white crystalline odorless solid is a derivative of cyclopentadiene.  It was popularized to control fire ants but by virtue of its chemical robustness and lipophilicity it was recognized as a bioaccumulative pollutant. The spread of the red imported fire ant was encouraged by the use of mirex, which also kills native ants that are highly competitive with the fire ants. The United States Environmental Protection Agency prohibited its use in 1976. It is prohibited by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.\n\nProduction and applications\nMirex was first synthesized in 1946, but was not used in pesticide formulations until 1955. Mirex was produced by the dimerization of hexachlorocyclopentadiene in the presence of aluminium chloride.\n\nMirex is a stomach insecticide, meaning that it must be ingested by the organism in order to poison it. The insecticidal use was focused on Southeastern United States to control the imported fire ants Solenopsis saevissima richteri and Solenopsis invicta. Approximately 250,000 kg of mirex was applied to fields between 1962-75 (US NRC, 1978).  Most of the mirex was in the form of \"4X mirex bait,\" which consists of 0.3% mirex in 14.7% soybean oil mixed with 85% corncob grits. Application of the 4X bait was designed to give a coverage of 4.2 g mirex/ha and was delivered by aircraft, helicopter or tractor. 1x and 2x bait were also used. Use of mirex as a pesticide was banned in 1978.  The Stockholm Convention banned production and use of several persistent organic pollutant, and mirex is one of the \"dirty dozen\".\n\nDegradation\nCharacteristic of chlorocarbons, mirex does not burn easily; combustion products are expected to include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride, chlorine, phosgene, and other organochlorine species.  Slow oxidation produces chlordecone (\"Kepone\"), a related insecticide that is also banned in most of the western world, but more readily degraded. Sunlight degrades mirex primarily to photomirex (8-monohydromirex) and later partly to 2,8-dihydromirex.\n\nMirex is highly resistant to microbiological degradation. It only slowly dechlorinates to a monohydro derivative by anaerobic microbial action in sewage sludge and by enteric bacteria. Degradation by soil microorganisms has not been described.\n\nBioaccumulation and biomagnification \nMirex is highly cumulative and amount depends upon the concentration and  duration of exposure. There is evidence of accumulation of mirex in aquatic and terrestrial food chains to harmful levels.  After 6 applications of mirex bait at 1.4 kg/ha, high mirex levels were found in some species; turtle fat contained 24.8 mg mirex/kg, kingfishers, 1.9 mg/kg, coyote fat, 6 mg/kg, opossum fat, 9.5 mg/kg, and racoon fat, 73.9 mg/kg.  In a model ecosystem with a terrestrial-aquatic interface, sorghum seedlings were treated with mirex at 1.1 kg/ha. Caterpillars fed on these seedlings and their faeces contaminated the water which contained algae, snails, Daphnia,  mosquito larvae, and fish. After 33 days, the ecological magnification value was 219 for fish and 1165 for snails.\n\nAlthough general environmental levels are low, it is widespread in the biotic and abiotic environment. Being lipophilic, mirex is strongly adsorbed on sediments.\n\nSafety\nMirex is only moderately toxic in single-dose animal studies (oral  values range from 365–3000 mg/kg body weight). It can enter the body via inhalation, ingestion, and via the skin. The most sensitive effects of repeated exposure in animals are principally associated with the liver, and these effects have been observed with doses as low as 1.0 mg/kg diet (0.05 mg/kg body weight per day), the lowest dose tested. At higher dose levels, it is fetotoxic (25 mg/kg in diet) and teratogenic (6.0 mg/kg per day). Mirex was not generally active in short-term tests for genetic activity. There is sufficient evidence of its carcinogenicity in mice and rats. Delayed onset of toxic effects and mortality is typical of mirex poisoning. Mirex is toxic for a range of aquatic organisms, with crustacea being particularly sensitive.\n\nMirex induces pervasive chronic physiological and biochemical disorders in various vertebrates. No acceptable daily intake (ADI) for mirex has been advised by FAO/WHO. IARC (1979) evaluated mirex's carcinogenic hazard and concluded that \"there is sufficient evidence for its carcinogenicity to mice and rats. In the absence of adequate data in humans, based on above result it can be said, that it has carcinogenic risk to humans”. Data on human health effects do not exist .\n\nHealth effects\nPer a 1995 ATSDR report mirex caused fatty changes in the livers, hyperexcitability and convulsion, and inhibition of reproduction in animals. It is a potent endocrine disruptor, interfering with estrogen-mediated functions such as ovulation, pregnancy, and endometrial growth. It also induced liver cancer by interaction with estrogen in female rodents.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n \n International Organization for the Management of Chemicals (IOMC), 1995, POPs Assessment Report, December.1995.\n Lambrych KL, and JP Hassett.

Wilson was an American gynecologist who is known for writing the best-selling 1966 book Feminine Forever. He is also known for his organization the Wilson Research Foundation (WRA). In Feminine Forever, Wilson promoted the use of estrogen therapy to avoid the menopause and associated symptoms. He characterized menopause as a serious disease state and made strong claims about the effectiveness and safety of menopausal hormone therapy in alleviating it and improving quality of life and health. Wilson's claims were criticized as not being based on adequate research and evidence. Subsequently, trials such as the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) contradicted Wilson's claims and showed that menopausal hormone therapy could have significant medical risks and that its benefits were not as great as once believed.\n\nWilson's early medical career was unremarkable, and he did not publish his first papers until 1962, when he was in his late 60s.\n\nIt was revealed by Wilson's son, Ronald Wilson, that Wyeth-Ayerst had secretly paid all of the fees for Wilson to write his book and also helped finance his foundation. Other pharmaceutical companies additionally funded the Wilson Research Foundation. Within 10 years of the publishing of his book, in which Wilson promoted the use of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) and of menopausal hormone therapy in general, Premarin became the fifth most-prescribed drug in the United States.\n\nWorks\n\nBooks\n\nJournal articles\n\nSee also\n Anti-aging movement § Menopausal hormone drugs\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican gynecologists\n1895 births\n1981 deaths"}

A hard hitting middle order batsman, Akram played first-class cricket for Chittagong Division. As captain, he led Bangladesh to being the winners of the 1997 ICC Trophy. He is currently the chief selector of the BCB, along with Habibul Bashar and Minhajul Abedin.\n\nAkram Khan was part of Bangladesh's inaugural Test match, in 2000–01 against India. He had been playing One Day International cricket since 1988. He developed as an international player under the able guidance of Gazi Ashraf Lipu.\n<ref> Rafiqul Ameer: Looking back: Bangladesh cricket in the 80's\" (Retrieved on 2008-07-28)</ref>\n\nEarly life\nAkram Khan was born in the port city of Chittagong. His paternal Khan'' family is a prestigious family in the city, migrated from Bihar. His brother is reputed footballer Iqbal Khan, making Akram the uncle of Bangladeshi cricketers Nafees and Tamim Iqbal.\n\nInternational career\nHe was already well into his 30s when he played in Bangladesh's inaugural match. He finished his short Test career with a moderate average of 16.18. His highest, 44, came against Zimbabwe cricket team at Harare in 2001.\n\nHe made his One Day International debut in October 1988, in his hometown Chittagong. Batting at No. 8, he defied the strong Pak bowling attack scoring 21* of 35 deliveries. He captained Bangladesh in the Asia Cup at Sharjah in 1995. He was the team's most consistent performer scoring 24, 24 & 44 against India, Sri-Lanka and Pakistan respectively. His first ODI 50 came against Pakistan at Colombo in 1997. There he shared a 110 run partnership with Athar Ali Khan. His highest ODI score of 65, came at Dhaka against Kenya in 1999. He followed this with 50* against Zimbabwe. He played in two WCs, in 1999 & in 2003. He played a large part in Bangladesh's upset win in 1999 World Cup over Pakistan with an innings of 42.\n\nHis most memorable moment came in the 1997 ICC Trophy, as he lifted the cup for his side. He contributed a quickfire 22 off 27 balls, including a six and a four, in the final. Earlier, he had played a captain's knock in the do-or-die game against the Netherlands. His 68* helped Bangladesh win by 3 wicket. Bangladesh were struggling at 15/4, chasing a small total, after the Dutch fast bowler Lefebre demolished the top order. Then Akram Khan changed the course of the match with two half-century partnerships with the veteran Minhajul Abedin and the medium-pacer Saiful Islam.  Overall, he finished the tournament with 185 runs at an average of 37.00. His effort against the Dutch is not his only match winning innings in International Cricket Council Trophy history. In 1994, batting at No. 7, he scored 64* against USA, taking his team from 36/5 to 147/7, winning the match by 3 wickets. And in 1990, he took Bangladesh to a vital 3 wicket win against Fiji with a knock of 42*. Overall, in 24 matches in 3 ICC Trophy tournaments, he scored 476 runs at an average of 36.61. Also, bowling his gentle medium pacers, he took 10 wickets with an impressive average of 18.7.\n\nInternational captaincy\nHe took the captaincy of the national side at a difficult time during the 1994–95 season. Following the disappointment of the 1994 ICC Trophy in Kenya, there was dissatisfaction and disunity among the players. Akram, who was an established member of the side was selected to lead the side. This seemed slightly risky, as the Chittagong batsman had little previous experience as captain. But, he performed admirably, leading his side to some memorable successes.\n\nIn December, 1994, he led his side to the final of 1994–95 SAARC Quadrangular cricket tournament in Dhaka. He batted bravely in the final, top-scoring with 66(before falling to leg spin of Sairaj Bahutule). But his side lost by 52 runs to India 'A', led by Praveen Amre. In 1996, he led Bangladesh to victory in the South East Asian Cricket. It was followed by a bigger triumph in ICC Trophy (1997) in KL. He also led Bangladesh to their first ever ODI win. After Mohammad Rafique & Athar Ali Khan posted a century opening stand, Akram's quickfire 39 (from just 51 deliveries) took Bangladesh to 237/4, winning by 6 wickets against Kenya. He is the first ODI win captain in Bangladesh.\n\nRelatives\nHis family has produced a number of other cricketers. In recent times, his nephews Nafees Iqbal and Tamim Iqbal have worn national colors. Both of them are opening bats. While right-handed Nafees Iqbal has lost his form after some initial successes, his younger brother, left-handed Tamim, became the most successful run-scorer for Bangladesh.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n'I found international cricket easier than domestic matches' by Mohammad Isam at Cricinfo\n\n1968 births\nLiving people\nBangladesh Test cricketers\nBangladesh One Day International cricketers\nBangladeshi cricket captains\nBangladeshi cricketers\n20th-century Bangladeshi cricketers\n21st-century Bangladeshi cricketers\nChittagong Division cricketers\nCricketers at the 1998 Commonwealth Games\nCricketers at the 1999 Cricket World Cup\nCricketers at the 2003 Cricket World Cup\nCricketers from Chittagong\nBangladeshi cricket coaches\nAbahani Limited cricketers\nRecipients of the Bangladesh National Sports Award\nCommonwealth Games competitors for Bangladesh\nKhan cricketing family\nBangladeshi Sunni Muslims\nBangladeshi people of Bihari descent\n21st-century Muslims"}

The album consists of five original tracks and seven remixed tracks that had previously been released on Barnes' 1984 debut album Bodyswerve.\n\nDetails\nFor the Working Class Man (re-titled Jimmy Barnes for the international market—after the original title of A Week Away from Paradise was scrapped—with a slightly altered track listing and different cover artwork) was specifically geared toward securing Barnes a break into the American music market by Geffen. The new material found on the album was recorded in New York and Los Angeles with a variety of high-profile American producers, session musicians, and outside songwriters. Journey's Jonathan Cain contributed, produced and performed on two tracks, \"Working Class Man\" (which has since become Barnes' signature song as a solo artist after being featured in the Ron Howard film Gung Ho) and \"American Heartbeat\", Steven Van Zandt of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band co-wrote \"Ride the Night Away\", Chas Sandford penned \"I'd Die to Be with You Tonight\" and \"Without Your Love\" was co-written with former Rainbow keyboardist Tony Carey.\n\nIn 2010 the album was remastered and reissued under the title \"For the Working Class Man 25\" under license to Liberation Music for Australia and New Zealand. This reissue has the same songs in the same order as the original release, however, four of the tracks (\"I'd Die to Be with You Tonight\", \"Ride the Night Away\", \"Working Class Man\" and \"No Second Prize\") were extensively reworked in 2009 by David Nicholas (for DNA Productions) resulting in significantly different track lengths. The album cover of the reissue is derived from the original Australian version; the most significant differences being the addition of an outer black square framing border, a bold black number \"25\" in the lower left hand corner while the main photograph has an (apparently) deeper red saturation.\n\nIn October 2010, For the Working Class Man, was listed in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums.\n\nAs of 2012, For the Working Class Man has sold more than 500,000 copies (7 x Platinum) in Barnes' native Australia.\n\nIn October 2017, a two disc \"Commemorative Edition\" of the album was released; the first disc contains the original album remastered by Don Bartley, the second disc (a DVD) contains a live performance from 1984.

Sometimes, these sets used to operate 8- or 12-car-long expresses to Nottingham Victoria in the final years of the GCML. Coincidentally, Class 115 units operated services under Table 115 in the British Rail timetable.\n\nConstruction and service\nBased on the basic Derby high density design, the sets are similar to Class 127 but were internally superior as the class had larger windows, better furnishings, lighting and wall surfaces.\n\nSix sets were also built for the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) line between Liverpool and Manchester, where in 1960 they replaced steam haulage on the limited stop services via Warrington. These units lasted on the CLC until the mid-1980s when the principal services on that line became locomotive-hauled once again using Class 31 diesels. The CLC units were then transferred to join the identical ones at Marylebone. \n\nClass 115 units also worked from Tyseley in the later years.\n\nThe Marylebone sets, which were later transferred to Bletchley but remained on Chiltern Line duties (and finally to Old Oak Common), were declared surplus after the introduction of Class 165s, from 1991 onwards. While at Bletchley and Old Oak Common depots the class found use on the Gospel Oak to Barking Line, units being formed as power twins.  They were, in turn, replaced on this line by Class 117 power twins, displaced from Paddington suburban duties.\n\nThe final class 115 working out of Marylebone was on 29 July 1992. The Tyseley vehicles survived a bit longer, until February 1994.\n\nSome of the class briefly found their way on to the Redhill to Tonbridge Line to replace ageing DEMU sets.  The line was electrified in 1993, in order to allow a diversionary route for the Eurostar, and the class 115s were replaced initially with Class 411 EMUs, then ex-Merseyrail Class 508 EMUs in 1998 (after privatisation).\n\nAccidents and incidents\n\nOn 11 December 1981, two four-car Class 115 units were involved in a collision between Gerrards Cross and Seer Green. The driver of an empty stock train, traveling from Marylebone to Princes Risborough, had stopped in the cutting between Gerrards Cross and Seer Green, to clear tree branches that were overhanging and had fallen onto the track, due to very heavy snow fall. Behind the empty stock train, a passenger train travelling from Marylebone to Banbury, was, incorrectly, authorised to pass a signal at danger at Gerrards Cross, entering the same section of track and partially telescoped the stationary train. Four people were killed, including the driver of the passenger train, and five others were seriously injured.\n\nTechnical details\n\n Builder: BR Derby\n Introduced: 1960\n Coupling Code: Blue Square\n Body:  × \n Engines: BUT (Leyland Albion) of  (2 per DMBS)\n Transmission: Standard mechanical\n Weight: DMBS ; TCL ; TS\n\nPreservation\n\n15 vehicles are preserved.

The film takes its title from a Beatles song of the same title.\n\nPlot\nRonald Miller is a typical high school nerd living in suburban Tucson, Arizona. He has spent all summer mowing lawns to save up for a telescope. At an opportune moment, he makes a deal with next-door neighbor and popular cheerleader Cindy Mancini. She had borrowed her mother's expensive suede outfit without permission to wear to a Labor Day party, only to have wine accidentally spilled on it. Cindy reluctantly agrees to help Ronald look \"cool\" by posing as his girlfriend for a month for $1,000 (which was used to replace the ruined outfit), although she already has a boyfriend, Bobby, who is attending the University of Iowa.\n\nRonald then trades his nerdy, yet loyal, friends for the popular but shallow students, and undergoes a complete clothing and hair makeover under Cindy's direction. Over time, a bond develops between them. Cindy has Ronald read a secret poem she wrote that means a great deal to her. In turn, Ronald reveals his interests in astronomy and space travel. On their last date that Ronald paid for, Cindy begins to have real feelings for him and hints that she would like to kiss him, but he misunderstands. The next day at school, they stage a breakup in front of a crowd, but Ronald takes things too far and says some hurtful things about Cindy in front of her friends. She remains calm and distant, but informs Ronald that popularity is hard work and that he needs to make sure that he \"stays himself.\" The next day, Cindy notices him behaving arrogantly at school, and becomes jealous when she sees him flirting with her best friends Barbara and Patty.\n\nRonald takes Patty to a school dance, where he performs a dance he learned from an African cultural show on public television he mistakenly thought was the latest dance craze performed on American Bandstand. At first, the other kids are mystified, but they soon join in, and Ronald's new \"trendy\" dancing further increases his popularity. On Halloween night, he and some jocks drive to the house of Kenneth, Ronald's best friend, where the jocks test his loyalty by coercing him to hurl dog feces at Kenneth's house. Kenneth is lying in wait and catches Ronald, but lets him go before his father can call the police. Kenneth ignores him the next day at school.\n\nAt a New Year's Eve party at Big John's house, Ronald starts drinking and has a romantic tryst with his date, Iris, in the bathroom. Cindy walks by and hears Ronald reciting her special poem to Iris. Devastated, Cindy starts drinking even more. Later, Cindy's boyfriend, Bobby, unexpectedly shows up at the party. After Bobby learns about Cindy's \"relationship\" with Ronald, he breaks up with her. Cindy tries to explain that Ronald paid her to pretend they were dating, but Bobby does not believe her and walks out on her. In a drunken rage, Cindy reveals the truth about her and Ronald to the partygoers, and Ronald is immediately ostracized. Dejected, he leaves and spends the night in his garage crying himself to sleep. When school resumes, he finds himself a social outcast, by both the jocks and the nerds. His attempts to reconcile with both Cindy and Kenneth are rebuffed.\n\nRonald gets an opportunity to redeem himself at lunch when he sees Quint, a jock, bullying Kenneth after noticing Kenneth helping Patty with her math homework. Quint threatens Kenneth with physical violence if Kenneth does not go back to \"his side of the cafeteria.\" Ronald intervenes, threatening to break Quint's pitching arm if he does not leave Kenneth alone. Ronald points out that the three were all friends at one time: when they were nine, Quint fell out of their treehouse and broke his arm and Kenneth and Ronald carried him twelve blocks to the hospital. Ronald confesses he was desperate to run with the popular crowd but had messed up by trying to buy his way in (unlike Kenneth, who was helping Patty out of a genuine interest in her), that the clique dynamic is \"all bullshit\" and that it is tough enough just being yourself, and walks away. Quint apologizes to Kenneth and they shake hands as the whole school applauds. Ronald officially redeems himself with his friends and Cindy.\n\nRecognizing Ronald's worth, Cindy chooses to spend an evening with him rather than hang out with her friends, hopping on the back of his riding lawnmower. Ronald then asks Cindy to prom, and they kiss for the first time, as the Beatles' title song plays. The new couple then ride off into the sunset on the lawnmower.\n\nCast\n\nProduction notes\nThe film was shot on location in Tucson, Arizona, at Tucson High Magnet School (then known as Tucson High School). The choreography is by Paula Abdul, who makes an uncredited appearance as a dancer.\n\nOn a date where the main characters begin to bond, they jump the perimeter wall and explore the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group Aircraft Bone Yard on Davis–Monthan Air Force Base that contains 4,400 aircraft.\n\nThe film was originally titled Boy Rents Girl but was changed when rights to The Beatles song of the same name were obtained.The cast included long time character actor, Steve Franken, in a minor role, and Seth Green in one of his earlier roles.\n\nCritical reception\nCan't Buy Me Love received mixed reviews from critics. Caryn James, in The New York Times, wrote that the film missed its mark and traded its potential originality for a bid at popularity: \nRoger Ebert gave the film a half star out of a possible 4: \n\nRotten Tomatoes has a rating of 50% based on 24 critics with the consensus: \"While Can't Buy Me Love gets some value out of its plucky leads, this romantic comedy struggles to find grace in a cynical conceit that belongs in the bargain bin.\" In 2006, it ranked number 41 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies.\n\nAwards\nYoung Artist Award\n Won: Best Young Actor in a Motion Picture—Comedy, Patrick Dempsey\n Nominated: Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture—Comedy, Amanda Peterson\n Nominated: Best Young Actress in a Motion Picture—Comedy, Tina Caspary\n Nominated: Best Family Motion Picture—Comedy\n\nHome media\nTouchstone Home Entertainment released the film on VHS and DVD on August 14, 2002.\n\nAs of June 2022, it is available for streaming via Disney+ in Canada, and previously on Netflix, Cinemax, Tubi, Hulu, and The Roku Channel in the US.\n\nSoundtrack\nIn 2013, Intrada Records released Robert Folk's complete score for the film on a limited edition CD paired with David Newman's work for Paradise.\n\nRemake\nIn 2003, Can't Buy Me Love was remade as Love Don't Cost a Thing starring Nick Cannon and Christina Milian. Though the triggering event differs between the two films, many of the aspects/scenes from the original film are reinterpreted in this remake, such as the eating of raw egg in the Home Economics classroom, as well as the cheerleader telling the bully that he is sitting in the wrong section in the cafeteria that he needs to sit in the \"asshole section\" of the cafeteria.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n \n \n\n1987 films\n1980s coming-of-age comedy films\n1980s high school films\n1987 romantic comedy films\n1980s teen comedy films\n1980s teen romance films\nAmerican coming-of-age comedy films\nAmerican high school films\nAmerican romantic comedy films\nAmerican teen comedy films\nAmerican teen romance films\nComing-of-age romance films\n1980s English-language films\nFilms about proms\nFilms directed by Steve Rash\nFilms scored by Robert Folk\nFilms set in Tucson, Arizona\nFilms shot in Tucson, Arizona\nTouchstone Pictures films\n1980s American films"}
{"id": "4048014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoamine%20oxidase%20A", "title": "Monoamine oxidase A", "text": "Monoamine oxidase A, also known as MAO-A, is an enzyme (E.C. 1.4.3.4) that in humans is encoded by the MAOA gene. This gene is one of two neighboring gene family members that encode mitochondrial enzymes which catalyze the oxidative deamination of amines, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. A mutation of this gene results in Brunner syndrome. This gene has also been associated with a variety of other psychiatric disorders, including antisocial behavior. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed.\n\nStructures\n\nGene \nMonoamine oxidase A, also known as MAO-A, is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MAOA gene. \nThe promoter of MAOA contains conserved binding sites for Sp1, GATA2, and TBP. This gene is adjacent to a related gene (MAOB) on the opposite strand of the X chromosome.\n\nIn humans, there is a 30-base repeat sequence repeated several different numbers of times in the promoter region of MAO-A. There are 2R (two repeats), 3R, 3.5R, 4R, and 5R variants of the repeat sequence, with the 3R and 4R variants most common in all populations. The variants of the promoter have been found to appear at different frequencies in different ethnic groups in an American sample cohort.\n\nThe epigenetic modification of MAOA gene expression through methylation likely plays an important role in women. A study from 2010 found epigenetic methylation of MAOA in men to be very low and with little variability compared to women, while having higher heritability in men than women.\n\nProtein \n\nMAO-A shares 70% amino acid sequence identity with its homologue MAO-B. Accordingly, both proteins have similar structures.  Both MAO-A and MAO-B exhibit an N-terminal domain that binds flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a central domain that binds the amine substrate, and a C-terminal α-helix that is inserted in the outer mitochondrial membrane.  MAO-A has a slightly larger substrate-binding cavity than MAO-B, which may be the cause of slight differences in catalytic activity between the two enzymes, as shown in quantitative structure-activity relationship experiments. Both enzymes are relatively large, about 60 kilodaltons in size, and are believed to function as dimers in living cells.\n\nFunction \n\nMonoamine oxidase A catalyzes O2-dependent oxidation of primary arylalkyl amines, most importantly neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin.  This is the initial step in the breakdown of these molecules.  The products are the corresponding aldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and ammonia:\n\nR-Amine +  +  → R-Aldehyde +  + \n\nThis reaction is believed to occur in three steps, using FAD as an electron-transferring cofactor.  First, the amine is oxidized to the corresponding imine, with reduction of FAD to FADH2.  Second, O2 accepts two electrons and two protons from FADH2, forming  and regenerating FAD.  Third, the imine is hydrolyzed by water, forming ammonia and the aldehyde.\n\nCompared to MAO-B, MAO-A has a higher specificity for serotonin and norepinephrine, while the two enzymes have similar affinity for dopamine and tyramine.\n\nMAO-A is a key regulator for normal brain function. In the brain, the highest levels of transcription occur in the brain stem, hypothalamus, amygdala, habenula, and nucleus accumbens, and the lowest in the thalamus, spinal cord, pituitary gland, and cerebellum. Its expression is regulated by the transcription factors SP1, GATA2, and TBP via cAMP-dependent regulation.  MAO-A is also expressed in cardiomyocytes, where it is induced in response to stress such as ischemia and inflammation.\n\nClinical significance\n\nCancer \n\nMAO-A produces an amine oxidase, which is a class of enzyme known to affect carcinogenesis.  Clorgyline, an MAO-A enzyme inhibitor, prevents apoptosis in melanoma cells, in vitro.  Cholangiocarcinoma suppresses MAO-A expression, and those patients with higher MAO-A expression had less adjacent organ invasion and better prognosis and survival.\n\nCardiovascular disease \n\nMAOA activity is linked to apoptosis and cardiac damage during cardiac injury following ischemic-reperfusion.\n\nBehavioral and neurological disorders \nThere is some association between low activity forms of the MAOA gene and autism. Mutations in the MAOA gene results in monoamine oxidase deficiency, or Brunner syndrome. Other disorders associated with MAO-A include Alzheimer's disease, aggression, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Effects of parenting on self-regulation in adolescents appear to be moderated by 'plasticity alleles', of which the 2R and 3R alleles of MAOA are two, with \"the more plasticity alleles males (but not females) carried, the more and less self-regulation they manifested under, respectively, supportive and unsupportive parenting conditions.\"\n\nDepression \nMAO-A levels in the brain as measured using positron emission tomography are elevated by an average of 34% in patients with major depressive disorder. Genetic association studies examining the relationship between high-activity MAOA variants and depression have produced mixed results, with some studies linking the high-activity variants to major depression in females, depressed suicide in males, major depression and sleep disturbance in males and major depressive disorder in both males and females.\n\nOther studies failed to find a significant relationship between high-activity variants of the MAOA gene and major depressive disorder. In patients with major depressive disorder, those with MAOA G/T polymorphisms (rs6323) coding for the highest-activity form of the enzyme have a significantly lower magnitude of placebo response than those with other genotypes.\n\nAntisocial behavior \nIn humans, an association between the 2R allele of the VNTR region of the gene and an increase in the likelihood of committing serious crime or violence has been found. The VNTR 2R allele of MAOA has been found to be a risk factor for violent delinquency, when present in association with stresses, i.e. family issues, low popularity or failing school.\n\nA connection between the MAO-A gene 3R version and several types of anti-social behaviour has been found: Maltreated children with genes causing high levels of MAO-A were less likely to develop antisocial behavior.  Low MAO-A activity alleles which are overwhelmingly the 3R allele in combination with abuse experienced during childhood resulted in an increased risk of aggressive behaviour as an adult, and men with the low activity MAOA allele were more genetically vulnerable even to punitive discipline as a predictor of antisocial behaviour. High testosterone, maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy, poor material living standards, dropping out of school, and low IQ predicted violent behavior are associated with men with the low-activity alleles. According to a large meta-analysis in 2014, the 3R allele had a small, nonsignificant effect on aggression and antisocial behavior, in the absence of other interaction factors. Owing to methodological concerns, the authors do not view this as evidence in favor of an effect.\n\nThe MAO-A gene was the first candidate gene for antisocial behavior and was identified during a \"molecular genetic analysis of a large, multigenerational, and notoriously violent, Dutch kindred\". A study of Finnish prisoners revealed that a MAOA-L (low-activity) genotype, which contributes to low dopamine turnover rate, was associated with extremely violent behavior. For the purpose of the study, \"extremely violent behavior\" was defined as at least ten committed homicides, attempted homicides or batteries.\n\nHowever, a large genome-wide association study has failed to find any large or statistically significant effects of the MAOA gene on aggression. A separate GWAS on antisocial personality disorder likewise did not report a significant effect of MAOA. Another study, while finding effects from a candidate gene search, failed to find any evidence in a large GWAS. A separate analysis of human and rat genome wide association studies, Mandelian randomization studies, and causal pathway analyses likewise failed to reveal robust evidence of MAOA in aggression. This lack of replication is predicted from the known issues of candidate gene research, which can produce many substantial false positives.\n\nAggression and the \"Warrior gene\" \n\nLow-activity variants of the VNTR promoter region of the MAO-A gene have been referred to as the warrior gene.  When faced with social exclusion or ostracism, individuals with the low activity MAO-A variants showed higher levels of aggression than individuals with the high activity MAO-A gene.  Low activity MAO-A could significantly predict aggressive behaviour in a high provocation situation: Individuals with the low activity variant of the MAO-A gene were more likely (75% as opposed to 62%, out of a sample size of 70) to retaliate, and with greater force, as compared to those with a normal MAO-A variant if the perceived loss was large.\n\nThe effects of MAOA genes on aggression have also been criticized for being heavily overstated. Indeed, the MAOA gene, even in conjunction with childhood adversity, is known to have a very small effect. The vast majority of people with the associated alleles have not committed any violent acts.\n\nLegal implications \nIn a 2009 criminal trial in the United States, an argument based on a combination of \"warrior gene\" and history of child abuse was successfully used to avoid a conviction of first-degree murder and the death penalty; however, the convicted murderer was sentenced to 32 years in prison. In a second case, an individual was convicted of second-degree murder, rather than first-degree murder, based on a genetic test that revealed he had the low-activity MAOA variant. Judges in Germany are more likely to sentence offenders to involuntary psychiatric hospitalization on hearing an accused's MAOA-L genotype.\n\nEpigenetics \nStudies have linked methylation of the MAOA gene with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women.  A second MAOA VNTR promoter, P2, influences epigenetic methylation and interacts with having experienced child abuse to influence antisocial personality disorder symptoms, only in women. A study of 34 non-smoking men found that methylation of the gene may alter its expression in the brain.\n\nAnimal studies \n\nA dysfunctional MAOA gene has been correlated with increased aggression levels in mice, and has been correlated with heightened levels of aggression in humans. In mice, a dysfunctional MAOA gene is created through insertional mutagenesis (called 'Tg8'). Tg8 is a transgenic mouse strain that lacks functional MAO-A enzymatic activity. Mice that lacked a functional MAOA gene exhibited increased aggression towards intruder mice.\n\nSome types of aggression exhibited by these mice were territorial aggression, predatory aggression, and isolation-induced aggression. The MAO-A deficient mice that exhibited increased isolation-induced aggression reveals that an MAO-A deficiency may also contribute to a disruption in social interactions. There is research in both humans and mice to support that a nonsense point mutation in the eighth exon of the MAOA gene is responsible for impulsive aggressiveness due to a complete MAO-A deficiency.\n\nInteractions\n\nTranscription factors \n\nA number of transcription factors bind to the promoter region of MAO-A and upregulate its expression. These include:Sp1 transcription factor, GATA2, TBP.\n\nInducers \n\nSynthetic compounds that up-regulate the expression of MAO-A include Valproic acid (Depakote)\n\nInhibitors \n\nSubstances that inhibit the enzymatic activity of MAO-A include:\n\nSynthetic compounds\n Befloxatone (MD370503)\n Brofaromine (Consonar)\n Cimoxatone\n Clorgyline (irreversible)\n Methylene Blue\n Minaprine (Cantor)\n Moclobemide (Aurorix, Manerix)\n Phenelzine (Nardil)\n Pirlindole (Pirazidol)\n Toloxatone (Humoryl)\n Tyrima (CX 157)\n Tranylcypromine (nonselective and irreversible)\nNatural products\n Incarviatone A\nHerbal sources\n Garlic (Garlic)\n β-Carboline alkaloids (Syrian Rue, Passion Flower, Tobacco smoke, Ayahuasca)\n Harmine\n Harmaline\n Isoquinoline alkaloids\n Piperine (Black pepper)\n Rosiridin (in vitro)\n\nSee also \n Monoamine oxidase B\n Monoamine oxidase inhibitor - a class of antidepressant drugs that block or inactivate one or both MAO isoforms\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n \n\nAggression\nCriminology\nEC 1.4.3\nHuman proteins\n\nde:Warrior Gene"}

It is a subsidiary of Teleflora, a subsidiary of The Wonderful Company.\n\nHistory \nIn 1920 a florist, Joe Dobson, of Leighton's Seedsmen and Florists in Glasgow, and a nurseryman, Carl Englemann in Saffron Walden, Essex were looking to increase their business. They knew of the Florists Telegraph Delivery Association (now known as Florists' Transworld Delivery) which had existed in the US since 1910, and applied to join as foreign members. In 1923 the UK arm of the FTDA was formed with 17 members. One of the straplines used in advertising was Flowers by Wire when the telegraph was actually used to communicate between florists. Later, telegrams were sent from member to member requesting deliveries to be made in the recipient florists area. In the original Interflora Directory, used by members, the longest established members could be recognised by their telegraphic addresses. This would be the only telegraphic address in that city to include the name Interflora. In the case of the founding members, their telegraphic addresses were \"Interflora Glasgow\" and \"Interflora Saffron Walden\", respectively.\n\nIn 1953 the name changed to Interflora and the slogan Flowers Worldwide along with the Mercury Man roundel became well known. \"Say it with Flowers\" became the subsequent and most famous slogan associated with Interflora.\n\nWhen telegrams became obsolete the most used method for requesting deliveries was by telephone. Following that Interflora brought in messenger1 in the mid to late 1980s, this system was very similar to sending a fax. In the late 1990s messenger2 was introduced, that used the internet to transmit orders.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Interflora brought out a system called Rose, this used the internet but instead of a dial-up connection a broadband connection was used. This enabled orders to be transmitted in real time. In 2011 Rose was updated to ROSEGold which provides a real time service between the call centre in Sleaford, Lincolnshire and the Interflora members around the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2005, the Interflora British Unit moved from being a trade association to a private equity ownership under investment company, 3i.\n\n3i sold British Interflora to US-based FTD Group, the successor to Florists' Transworld Delivery, in 2006.\n\nIn 2008, United Online Software Development acquired Interflora and FTD.\n\nIn 2012, Interflora bought the Gifts Division of Flying Brands.\n\nIn November 2013, United Online spun off its floral delivery subsidiary, FTD, which became a separate NASDAQ-traded company called FTD Companies, Inc., under the symbol FTD.\n\nIn June 2019, the FTD Group sold Interflora British Unit in a $59.5 million deal to another US-based flower delivery network, Teleflora, a subsidiary of The Wonderful Company since 1979.\n\nSee also\nFloral industry\nCut flowers\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \nLewis, Geoffrey (1986).The Interflora Story.

{"id": "4048025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota%20Aurion%20%28XV40%29", "title": "Toyota Aurion (XV40)", "text": "The Toyota Aurion (XV40)  is the original series of the Toyota Aurion, a mid-size car produced by Toyota in Australia and parts of Asia. Designated \"XV40\", Toyota manufactured the first generation Aurion between 2006 and 2012 until it was fully replaced by the XV50 series. While Asian production of the XV50 series began in late 2011, Toyota's Australian operations did not take on production of the new model until 2012.\n\nAlthough marketed as a separate model, the XV40 series Aurion is essentially a Toyota Camry (XV40) with revised front- and rear-end treatment, along with changes to the interior and Australian tuned suspension. In lieu of the \"Aurion\" nameplate, the majority of East and Southeast Asian markets received the Camry-based Aurion under the name Toyota Camry. However, in Australasia and the Middle East, Toyota sold the original version of the Camry alongside the Aurion. In these markets, the Aurion replaced the Avalon (XX10) model, which could trace its roots back to 1994 in North America.\n\nIn the Australasian and Middle Eastern markets, to further differentiate the Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota equipped the Aurion exclusively with a 3.5-litre V6 engine. With the Camry, the company only offered the 2.4-litre four-cylinder version. Previously in these markets, prior to the introduction of the Camry XV40, Toyota had offered both four- and a six-cylinder powerplants. Along with the naturally aspirated version, Toyota produced an Australia-only supercharged TRD Aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). At its release, Toyota claimed this performance variant to be the world's most powerful front-wheel drive car. The powertrains used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5-litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0- or a 2.4-litre form. These engines are teamed with a six-, four- and five-speed automatic transmissions, respectively.\n\nHistory of development \nOn 9 February 2006, Toyota Australia unveiled the Aurion alongside the Aurion Sportivo concept at the Melbourne International Motor Show at an official press conference. Toyota dropped the Avalon tag for their new large car, as it had gained a reputation to be an uninspiring car, both in the flesh and to drive. Toyota made use of the \"Aurion\" name to give the car a fresh start. Aurion means \"tomorrow\" in Ancient Greek, and Aurora translates to \"the dawn\" in Latin. The name was chosen after consumer research on more than 30 potential names. This gives implications of a completely new car and ties in with Toyota's advertising slogan, \"Can't wait for tomorrow\".\nBefore commencing production of the Aurion, Toyota Australia manufactured the full-size Avalon model at its Altona plant in Melbourne until June 2005. Production of the Avalon had begun in 2000, taking much of its basic design and mechanical features from the then six-year-old Avalon model sold in North America. The Avalon was offered as a larger, more upmarket car than the Toyota Camry, which it was built alongside. The original sales predictions were not met, with the Avalon failing to challenge rivals such as the Holden Commodore and the Ford Falcon. The reasoning behind this has been widely attributed to the Avalon's older design and styling, which has been widely described as \"bland\", as well as the front-wheel drive configuration and smaller engine displacement. In its best year, the Avalon only managed to reach half of Toyota's projected sales target, with many potential buyers opting for the slightly smaller sized V6 Camry, featuring the same engine as the Avalon.\n\nToyota, discovering that the Australian public wanted something that was modern and designed with consideration to the Australian market, began full-scale planning work on its Avalon replacement in 2002. Toyota Australia realised that no other model being developed at the time for Japan or North America was going to be suitable, and due to the size limitations of the Australian market, a completely indigenous model was unrealisable. However, at that time, Toyota Australia did not have any designers of its own. As a result, the company recruited Paul Beranger in August 2002 to set up Toyota Style Australia (TSA) in an industrial complex located in Dingley Village, Victoria. TSA first developed the X-Runner and Sportivo Coupe concepts, and in 2003, Nick Hogios, who had previously worked for Ford Australia on designing the XR performance models of the BA Falcon, was appointed chief designer. TSA's next venture was more significant—a privately developed model based on the Camry XV30—a car that signalled the beginning of the Aurion programme. Codenamed \"380L\" and developed during the course of 2003, this one-off model was forged by stripping panels and interior components from the donor Camry, and substituting these for TSA-developed versions. Total cost was approximately  million. Focus groups conducted by Toyota in early 2003 had ranked the Avalon at the bottom of the list when compared to the competing Holden Commodore, Ford Falcon and Mitsubishi Magna. Later on in the year, the same focus groups were called back and the Avalon was exchanged for the 380L. Overall, the groups ranked the Toyota as their first preference, and according to Beranger, \"didn't see the car as a Camry\". As such, Toyota Australia deduced that if the 380L was available for purchase there and then, they could sell it alongside the regular Camry as a six-cylinder car under a different name.\n\nDuring the 380L development, TSA had regular discussions with Toyota Japan on how its Avalon replacement would eventually turn out. Because TSA were an unknown quantity, having never designed a production vehicle, it took the division some time to convince Japan that they could indeed design a car themselves. When the 380L was consigned to a presentation with Japanese Toyota officials, TSA's lead designer Nick Hogios was requested to tender a proposal for the next-generation \"042L\" Camry design competition. While his submission was not chosen, Hogios was summoned to work on what would become the Aurion, then exclusively referred to as the \"Asian\" or \"prestige\" Camry, and codenamed \"043L\". Due to the success of TSA's earlier concepts and the 380L, Toyota Australia was given the authorisation to manufacture both the regular 042L and 043L Camrys and sell them side by side. In Australia, however, the regular Camry was to be limited to the four-cylinder engine, and the prestige Camry (later to become the Aurion) to the six. Hogios worked in Japan for nine months during 2004 designing the prestige Camry, and his final design was a collaborative effort between Japanese and Taiwanese designers, but the car's front-end styling is largely Hogios's own work. While the work in Japan was being undertaken, TSA began to make changes for the Australian Aurion variants. After the design stage was completed, Toyota Australia then commenced work on the development of the car, concurrently developing both the Australian car and the version for Asia. Beranger proclaims that the entire engineering undertaking, \"is probably one of the most significant jobs that any subsidiary of Toyota Japan has done anywhere in the world.\" The Australian variant of the car was codenamed \"323L\". Despite both cars being essentially identical, Australia was given a different code due to the car occupying a broader range in that market—from a fleet vehicle to a sports-oriented model. In Asia, the car's role is much narrower, being a high-end luxury car. The first Aurion-based Camry rolled off the assembly line in China in May 2006.\n\nDesign \nAurion takes its doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique from the regular Camry. This component sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.\n\nToyota claims that the Aurion is designed to Australian tastes, although it has been designed with markets such as Asia in mind. Hogios states that the Aurion follows the traits of current Australian styling, with a tendency to look towards European designs for inspiration. In addition, like its other vehicles of similar vintage, Toyota designed the Aurion within the realm of its \"vibrant clarity\" design language. According to chief designer Hogios, the car makes particular use of the \"vibrant clarity\" theory known as \"perfect imbalance\". This involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features. Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps. The front-end's \"double concave architecture\" can also be characterised by its protruding bonnet crease line and deep grille. The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a clamshell-shaped boot lid that envelops over the flanks, dual exhaust pipes and tail lamps. Design patents were filed on 27 December 2005 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nFor certain markets like China, where Camry sits right below similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is important for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.\n\nFacelift \n\nToyota of Thailand unveiled a reworked version of the East and Southeast Asian-market Camry in June 2009 equipped with a hybrid drivetrain. The revised Aurion-based Camry previewed the Australian Aurion's then upcoming facelift. The updated car features new headlamp and taillamp lens clusters with integrated foglamps, along with a redesigned front bumper, grille insert, and revised interior trim details. The revised Aurion was designed by Australian chief designer Nick Hogios, who also designed the original Aurion, and Anthony Cheung, assistant project manager from Thailand, during 2007. The hybrid version was also designed by Takafumi Ito, who also designed the facelifted regular Camry. The design registrations for the facelifted hybrid version, nothing changes made to the original were filed on 19 December 2008 at the US Patent and Trademark Office. Toyota Australia later revealed the updated car as its Aurion on 21 September. While the front-end of the original Aurion was designed with a \"double-concave\" architecture, the revised version abandons this for an \"X-Form\" design philosophy, characterised by a lower and wider trapezoidal shaped grille.\n\nLike the original version, the Aurion continues to offer differing frontal design treatments across the range. From side, the rehashed design is identified by the deletion of bodyside moulding strips and a range of new wheels designs, including the standard fitment of alloy wheels on the base-line AT-X. Interior upgrades in the form of new colour combinations are featured, along with upgraded instruments and gauges giving greater turn signal and warning-signal clarity. Revised audio systems, lighting and in-cabin storage are also featured. Prodigy and Presara versions receive a new \"linear satin\" wood grain finish.\n\nSafety \nSafety was a key aspect in the development of the Aurion. All safety features are standard across the entire range and there are no optional safety devices. Features such as dual front, side and curtain airbags, traction control, brake assist, electronic brakeforce distribution and Vehicle Stability Control come standard. In tests conducted by Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP), the base model scored a four-star rating, with 30.03 out of 37 points. Toyota caused controversy by not providing a third test vehicle for ANCAP to use for the optional \"side-pole impact test\". This third test, allows tested vehicles to be eligible for a five-star rating if the initial score is high enough. Toyota cited the additional expense of A$75,000–$100,000 including the car as being unjustifiable, and that they did not agree with the nature of the pole test. The scores given without the optional test indicate that the maximum two points that could have been earned would have been slightly less than needed to give the Aurion a five-star rating anyway. Due to Toyota's decision to fit a driver and front passenger seat belt reminder, along with their decision to fund the optional pole test, the Aurion's safety rating was upgraded to a full five stars from August 2009 production, with a score of 33.03 out of 37.\n\nPowertrains \nThe Aurion employs a version of Toyota's 2GR-FE V6 engine that also powers the V6 Camry outside of Australasia. With an engine displacement of 3.5-litres, the 2GR-FE engine is capable of outputting  and  of torque. Power rises by  with the use of 95 RON \"premium\" unleaded petrol. Acceleration figures for the car have been recorded at 7.4 seconds from standstill to , and Toyota claims a top speed of . The Aurion, which is Euro IV emissions compliant, is rated at  under the Australian ADR 81/01 fuel consumption test. The dual VVT-i 3.5-litre 2GR-FE engine paired to Toyota's six-speed U660E automatic transmission. This same transmission is also utilised by the supercharged TRD variants. These produce  and , combined with a combined fuel consumption of .\n\nIn some Asian countries where the Aurion is sold as the Toyota Camry, both 2.0- and 2.4-litre powerplants are offered. The naturally aspirated 3.5-litre engine is also available in some of these markets. The 2.0-litre 1AZ-FE inline-four has a maximum output of  of power and  of torque. These figures rise to  and  when the 2.4-litre 2AZ-FE unit is fitted. Of the two four-cylinder motors, the latter is teamed with Toyota's five-speed U250E automatic, with the U241E four-speed unit reserved for the 2.0-litre model. From circa 2009, Toyota began offering a new 2.0-litre 3ZR-FE inline-four petrol engine in some markets. Producing  and , the 3ZR-FE was available with the four-speed U241E automatic, or in some markets with a six-speed manual.\n\nRegions\n\nAustralasia \nToyota launched the Aurion in Australasia, where it competes with the rear-wheel drive Ford Falcon, Holden Commodore, and the now discontinued front-wheel drive Mitsubishi 380. The TRD variants were pitched to compete with the Subaru Liberty GT and Mazda 6 MPS. Since its introduction, the Aurion has received numerous awards and positive reviews. In particular, the car has been praised for its good performance mated with comparatively low fuel consumption, and the inclusion of safety and comfort features that are optional on competitor vehicles.\n\nPrior to its introduction, a target of 24,000 annualised sales were predicted for the Australian market, double that of the Avalon's eventual sales rate. A further 8,000 vehicles were forecast to be sent abroad to the Middle East and New Zealand. Starting from 2007, Toyota received a contract to deliver 10,000 export Aurions to the Middle East.\n\nThe Aurion was also judged best large car in the Drive Car of the Year competition for both 2006, 2007 and 2009.\n\nSpecification levels\n AT-X: Marketed primarily towards fleets buyers, the entry-level AT-X features air conditioning, power windows and mirrors, among others. The Aurion AT-X was awarded the Australia's Best Large Car award in 2006 and 2007; judges described the Aurion as \"...a terrific well-rounded package of technology and refinement. Toyota has produced a big six that has continued to outstrip traditional rivals in the Australian market.\"\n Sportivo: Available in two flavours for the Australian market, the Sportivo is the Aurion's sports oriented variant. The introductory Sportivo SX6 features a specially designed sports body kit, sports suspension, sports seats and 17-inch alloy wheels and tinted sports headlights. The Sportivo ZR6 also shares the same \"Sportivo\" exterior design, but is specified high, with electrically adjustable leather sports seats, parking sensors and dual-zone climate control air conditioning.\n Prodigy: Building onto what the AT-X offers, the semi-luxury Prodigy, branded the Touring in New Zealand and the Middle East, features an electrically adjustable driver's seat, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, parking sensors, wood grain interior and full leather upholstery. The Prodigy also sees a chrome grille, and 16-inch alloy wheels along with front fog lamps as standard.\n Presara: the luxury-oriented Presara features a lavishly appointed interior with features such as electric seats with a two-memory setting, a moonroof, push-start engine operation, a reversing camera, and satellite navigation. The Presara, marketed under the Grande moniker in New Zealand and the Middle East, also features high-intensity discharge headlamps with auto levelling front lighting system. When reversing, the side mirrors face down towards the ground (unless the mirror adjustment switch is in the off position) to assist the driver when parking in places where space is compromised.\n\nToyota Australia released the special edition \"Touring SE\" in October 2007, based on the AT-X. Features gained over the AT-X comprised 16-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, six CD stacker, a trip computer, dual zone climate control air-conditioning and a leather steering wheel and selection lever. Front and rear parking sensors, and dual-zone air conditioning were also fitted. The Touring SE was reintroduced in identical form in April 2008, again in October 2008, and then finally in April 2009. These 2009 versions differed slightly, with 17- in lieu of 16-inch wheels, the Sportivo grille, and sports front and rear lights. The price remains unchanged from the 2007 original. At the same time, a Touring SE variant of the Camry sedan was released with similar upgrades.\n\nIn 2011, a special edition of the Aurion, called the \"White LE\" was released with only 250 built. The model is based on the Prodigy, however, features a unique exterior and interior combination. The White LE is painted white and has unique alloy wheels, similar to those found on the Australian version Camry Grande. The bodykit is from the Sportivo viarants and the model has unique badging. The interior is a mixture of black and off white on the leather seats and interior panels.\n\nAsia \n\nToyota also manufactures and markets the Aurion in parts of East and Southeast Asia, where it is marketed under the Toyota Camry branding. This model gets a redesigned grille and is marketed under different trim levels to their Australasian counterparts. Although these vary from country to country, the range consists of the following models in some markets: 2.0 E, 2.0 G, 2.4 E, 2.4 G, 2.4 Sportivo, 2.4 V, 3.5 V and 3.5 Q. The decimal in the nomenclature denotes the engine displacement, with the letter representing the level of luxury.\n\nIn China, the Camry was unveiled in late April 2006 and commenced production on 23 May 2006. The Camry is sold in two variants—the 200 and 240. The 200 variant is mated to the 2.0-litre 1AZ-FE while 240 variant gets the 2.4-litre 2AZ-FE. The range consisted of the 200E, 200GVP, 200G, 240GVP, 200GN, 240G, 200GGB, 240GN, 240V, 240GGB, 240VN and the 240VGB. Transmission choices were the four-speed automatic gearbox for the 200 models and the five-speed automatic for the 240 models. Pricing for the Camry is 182,800 to 283,800 (US$26,760 to $41,550). The Camry Hybrid was introduced in April 2010 with trim levels known as the 240HG, 240HV and 240HV G-Book. Pricing for the Camry Hybrid is 319,800 to 364,800 yuan (US$48,000 to $55,000).\n\nRemaining units were also available as the Camry Classical for the 2013 model year with the 1AZ-FE engine and four-speed automatic gearbox with trims levels: 200E and 200G and priced at 182,800 and 193,800 yuan respectively (26,765 and US$28,375). The Camry Classical also retains the exterior and interior from the facelifted Southeast Asian Camry, but with a redesigned grille.\n\nIn Thailand, the 2.0-litre models are available in two trim packages: the 2.0 E and 2.0 G. The 2.4-litre variant is also available in Malaysia, utilizing the 2AZ-FE engine model. The output of this 2.4 V model is  at 6000 rpm with  of torque at 4000 rpm. Furthermore, a hybrid power train model has been available since 2009.\n\nIn Indonesia, the Camry is offered with two engines, the four-cylinder mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. This engine is offered in G and V trims. The other engine is the V6 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. This engine is only offered in the top-of-the-line Q trim. The Camry has enjoyed success in Indonesia, being the best selling car in its class. The 2.4 V and 3.5 Q models have been used extensively by the Indonesian government, owning thousands of Camrys in their fleet.\n\nIn the Philippines offers three grades: the base G, offering a 2.4-litre engine mated to a five-speed automatic transmission, has 2 SRS airbags, and has fabric seats. The 2.4 V is almost the same as the G variant, however, it has a 4-spoke steering wheel with wood grain, 2 SRS airbags, and has a leather-wrapped wood grain with chrome shift lever and knob. The 3.5 Q is the top-of-the-line segment, offering a 3.5 2GR-FE V6, 24V, DOHC and dual VVT-i. It is mated to a six-speed gate-type automatic transmission, adaptive front lighting system, automatic rain sensor, dual exhaust tail pipe, tri-color/Optitron with multi-information display, 2 SRS front airbags, side SRS airbags and a push start system. All of the variants has an integrated type head unit with in-dash 6 CD changer, MP3 and WMA player. All of the variants use a foot-type parking brake. All of the variants also have 4 front and 2 rear speakers.\n\nThe facelifted version of the Camry in the Philippines is offered in three trim levels, \"G\", \"V\" and \"Q\". The G trim is equipped with the 2AZ-FE engine mated to a five-speed automatic transmission, 10-spoke alloy-wheels, driver and front passenger SRS airbags, rear parking sensors and comes with fabric seats. On top of the G trim, the V trim offers leather interior, power-adjusted seats front and rear, smart keyless entry with push button engine start system, front and rear parking sensors, dual-zone climate control and cruise control. The Q trim is equipped with the 3.5-litre 2GR-FE V6 powertrain and a dual exhaust system with all the features of the V trim.\n\nIn Vietnam, the Camry was introduced in 2006 and has been available only in sedan form with two different trims: Camry 2.4 G and 3.5 Q. The 2.4 G trim comes with the 2.4-litre engine rated  and a 5-speed automatic gear box while the 3.5 Q trim is equipped with a 3.5L 2GR-FE engine rated  (SAE net) and a 6-speed automatic transmission standard. The two trims come with many safety features including brake assist system, Electronic brake-force distribution (EBD), vehicle stability control (VSC) and front and side airbags. The Vietnamese Camry is produced at the Toyota production plant in Phúc Yên, Vĩnh Phú.\n\nTRD Aurion \n\nToyota unveiled the Aurion Sports Concept at the 2006 Australian International Motor Show, held in Sydney. The A$8 million concept car was a styling exercise previewing the TRD Aurion, which was subsequently released in August 2007. TRD's first experiment with supercharger technology was with the Toyota Camry-based 2005 TS-01 concept.\n\nThe project's exterior design manager was Lee Moran, a former Ford Australia designer. He was chosen by Toyota Styling Australia chief Paul Berninger in 2005. One of Moran's focuses was to reduce the size of the grille and add emphasis to the front bumper line below it. This was done so the car had more of a Formula One oriented look. In the Toyota wind tunnel in Japan, the vehicle's drag coefficient was confirmed at 0.30, meaning that the car would operate better aerodynamically than its non-TRD variants. The TRD also features bold exterior additions that differentiate it with the standard Aurion range, such as exhaust pipes integrated into the bumper, tinted taillight lenses, and a unique bodykit. Along with the supercharged 3.5-litre V6 engine outputting  of power and  of torque, the TRD also incorporates an upgraded suspension system and tyres over the standard Aurion models to improve car handling.\n\nToyota Australia planned to sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the majority of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red Alcantara leather seats with black Alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger. This substantially reduces engine noise while bringing gains to power and torque.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\n \n \n \n \n\nCars introduced in 2006\n2010s cars\nCars of Australia\nFront-wheel-drive vehicles\nMid-size cars\nANCAP executive cars\nSedans\nPolice vehicles"}

It is an e-commerce company that sells products shipped from growers, suppliers and its own distribution facilities to consumers. ProFlowers was  headquartered in San Diego, California. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of FTD Companies.\n\nHistory\nProFlowers, later called \"Provide Commerce\", was started by Jared Polis in 1998. In February 2006 Liberty Media Corporation (NYSE:L; LMC.B) purchased Provide Commerce, Inc. (Nasdaq: PRVD) for a sum of $477 million in cash, at which point Provide Commerce became a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Media.  Provide Commerce also offers fruit, sweets and gift baskets direct from the supplier through its Gourmet Food Business Unit, which includes the brand names Cherry Moon Farms, Secret Spoon and Shari's Berries.\n\nIn 2007 Provide Commerce was selected as one of California's Best Places to Work (Sponsored by Employers Group 2007).\n\nIn 2008 Provide Commerce acquired RedEnvelope, a seller of gifts.\n\nIn 2010, Provide Commerce acquired Personal Creations, a personalized gifting company.\n\nIn June 2013, Provide Commerce acquired Gifts.com, a premium gifting company.\n\nIn November 2014, Provide Commerce acquired Sincerely, a mobile app gifting startup.\n\nIn 2014, flower delivery service Florists' Transworld Delivery agreed to buy ProFlowers and its sister gifting brands for $430 million, creating a combined company with over $1 billion in revenue. FTD Cos. completed its purchase of Provide Commerce Dec. 31, 2014.\n\nLitigation\nProFlowers was sued by its major rival, Florists' Transworld Delivery (FTD), for false advertising and unfair competition in August 2005. The suit focused on ProFlowers' claim to ship \"direct from the fields\" with \"no middlemen\", alleging that the company actually often stored flowers in refrigerated warehouses, including those of third parties. For its part, ProFlowers responded that the lawsuit was \"without merit\" and brought counterclaims against FTD. The lawsuit was settled a year later. ProFlowers did agree to make some modifications to its advertising, although as of February 2008, ProFlowers is once again claiming in its TV commercials that it delivers flowers \"straight to the door from the growers' fields\".\n\nTwo months after the FTD suit was filed, two law firms filed a class action lawsuit claiming that ProFlowers used deceptive marketing, also targeting the company's freshness claims. ProFlowers called it a copycat of the FTD lawsuit. It was settled with ProFlowers not admitting any wrongdoing, but offering $10 store credits to the millions of customers in the class, paying $250,000 in attorneys' fees, and \"altering its advertising\".\n\nIn September 2009 a class action lawsuit was filed against Provide-Commerce, the owner of ProFlowers  and Encore Marketing  the owner of Easy Saver, for fraud, with ProFlowers customers signed up unknowingly for the latter service leading to an unsolicited monthly fee.\n\nIn February 2011 a federal class action was filed accusing Provide-Commerce and Clarus Marketing Group of defrauding online shoppers by enrolling them in a membership program that costs $9 to $15 a month if they click on ads offering free shipping with a purchase.\n\nReferences\n\nRetail companies established in 1998\nInternet properties established in 1998\nCompanies based in San Diego\nOnline retailers of the United States\nFlorist companies"}

Located about  north of Ploiești, it is an important oil-extraction center. It is situated in the historical region of Muntenia.\n\nHistory\n\nThe town was created in 1968 by the unification of two neighbouring communes, Boldești and Scăeni. One village, Seciu, is administered by the town.\n\nThe phalanstère\n\nScăeni was the location of the only attempt to create a Charles Fourier-type phalanstère in Romania. In 1835, Theodor Diamant, a utopian socialist who had met Fourier in Paris, created the phalanstère, named The Agronomy and Manufacturing Society, on a patch of land provided by Emanoil Bălăceanu, a local land-owner. The Wallachian authorities saw this enterprise as a threat and took a stand against it. Therefore, the phalanstère was disbanded in 1836, a year and a half after it came into existence, with Diamant and Bălăceanu sent into exile.\n\nWorld War II\nDuring World War II, the area was extensively bombed, as part of Operation Tidal Wave. Air-raid shelters can still be found on the wooded hills around Boldești.\n\nCoat of arms\nThe coat of arms of Boldești-Scăeni depicts a thistle (in Romanian, scai or scaiete) which refers to the name of the old Scăeni commune, as well as a grape, which represents the vineyards on the Seciu hills. The shaking hands is a reminder of the 19th century Scăieni phalanstère experiment, but could also refer to the 1968 union of the Boldești and Scăieni communes.\n\nClimate\nBoldești-Scăeni has a humid continental climate (Cfb in the Köppen climate classification).\n\nEconomy\n\nThe town's economy revolves around oil-extraction as well as winemaking. Almost half of the town's surface is cultivated with vine. The Seciu winecellars are located in the direct vicinity of Boldești.\n\nIndustry developed in the town after 1968, with a glass factory open in Scăeni. Many people who live in Boldești-Scăeni also work in the neighbouring city of Ploiești.\n\nTrivia and Historical monuments \nThe utopian experiment by Theodor Diamant was featured in the movie \"Falansterul\" (\"The Phalanstere\"), directed by Savel Stiopul in 1979. Historical monuments in the city Boldești-Scăeni includes 6 historic monuments (3 in Seciu and 3 in the city itself), plus 3 new modern statues sculpted by Cristian Petru Balan from the United States. They are \"Glass Breaker\", a stainless steel statue, 6 m high, built in 2010, a single replica of the Statue of Liberty in New York City, worked in fiberglass reinforced concrete (5 m from ground) and statuary group \"Mihai Eminescu and Veronica Micle\" in front of the Culture House \"Mihai Eminescu\", two busts on a common base (2.5 m), all molded fiberglass and reinforced concrete. Last two monuments were erected in July 2014. Since ancient monuments only one is classified as a monument of national importance, that being \"Casa Rusescu\" in Seciu, built in 1826.\n\nNatives\n Cristian Vlad (born 1977), football player\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n  Scrisori către Vasile Alecsandri: Teodor Diamant (Letters to Vasile Alecsandri: Teodor Diamant), from wikisource.\n  Boldeşti-Scăieni: Monograph of Boldeşti-Scăieni, (by Cristian Petru Bălan, Ed.

Their use of \"coyly self-descriptive telephone numbers\" is part of founder James McCann's business model.\n\nHistory\n\nFounding and early years\nThe concept of using the word \"flowers\" within a phoneword was originated by William Alexander in the early 1980s. The phone number, 1-800-356-9377, had been randomly assigned to a trucking brokerage in Wisconsin owned by Curtis Jahn and was used for that company until 1981. In an agreement with Jahn that would later be sharply contested, Granville Semmes and David Snow formed a Louisiana corporation that began to use that number to sell flowers in Louisiana, starting in 1982. The use of the number would trigger a series of lawsuits. Their business struggled and that company was dissolved, with its assets going to investors James Poage and John Davis of Texas. The new corporation struggled financially as well. Its assets were acquired in 1986 by McCann, an owner of several flower shops in the New York City area since 1976, under whom the business saw success and growth.\n\nIn 1994, the company bought Conroy's Flowers.

It was released in 1995 (see 1995 in music). The album peaked at No. 14 in the UK charts. \"Cecilia\", a cover of the Simon and Garfunkel song, reached No. 4 on the UK charts. The song \"4 am\" was later re-recorded and appeared on the 1999 Madness album Wonderful.\n\nThe Lone Ranger was reissued in 2016 by Cherry Red Records as a two-CD deluxe edition.\n\nBackground\nAfter the Madness reunion concert in 1992, which yielded the album Madstock!, Suggs became involved in working on his first solo album. He had written a few songs, including \"Alcohol\" and \"Fortune Fish\". In 1994, Rob Dickins arranged for Suggs to work with producers Sly and Robbie on some songs. Dickins suggested \"I'm Only Sleeping\" as a track, while Sly and Robbie proposed \"Cecilia\" as one of the songs to work on. Other songs produced by Sly and Robbie are \"Camden Town\", \"Haunted\" and \"Off on Holiday\", and they also helped to produce \"The Tune\", a song written by Mike Barson. After the sessions with Sly and Robbie ended, other songs were recorded with other producers.\n\nSuggs collaborated with Barson to write and produce a number of song, including \"Camden Town\", \"4 am\", which is a tribute to The Kinks, and \"She's Gone\".  The songs, including \"Green Eyes\", were co-produced with engineer Kevin Petrie, who also helped with  \"Alcohol\" and \"Fortune Fish\".\n\nAfter the second Madstock concert, Madstock II, Suggs announced that he would pursue a solo career in August 1994, and made his first appearance as a solo artist in November on Danny Baker After All, performing \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and Morrissey's \"Suedehead\". His debut album The Lone Ranger was released in 1995.\n\nReception\n\nEvan Cater, writing for Allmusic, wrote, \"The Lone Ranger has the feel of an amateur demo, populated primarily by drum machines and synthesizers ... But despite the weakness of the production, Suggs manages credible covers of the Beatles' \"I'm Only Sleeping\" and Simon and Garfunkel's \"Cecilia.\" Cater was not impressed with Suggs' songwriting talent on the songs he wrote by himself, but felt that he fared better on the ones he co-wrote with Mike Barson, \"who appears to have a stronger sense of melody.\"\n\nRecord Collector'''s Mark Elliott wrote, \"this charming, 60s-influenced, 11-song set hits the sweet spot where an experimental edge packs an impressive commercial punch and everyone emerges with their dignity intact.\" Trouser Press'' described the album as delivering \"much the same ska pop mixture and music hall jollity as [Madness], but with more weight to the production.\"\n\nTrack listing\nAdapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n2016 reissue\nDisc one\nThe first disc contains the eleven tracks from the original album plus eight bonus tracks.\n\nDisc two\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\nAlthough no musicians are credited on the album, the following are thanked:\nJah Wobble\nPhil Spalding\nRico Rodriguez\nJazz Jamaica\nJohn Themis\nSly and Robbie\nLouchie Lou and Michie One (on \"Cecilia\") \nBen Barson (on \"Alcohol\") \nAnne Dudley – string arrangement on \"She's Gone\"\n\nTechnical\nSuggs – production (3, 4, 9-11), booklet photography\nMike Barson – production (3, 4, 9-11)\nSly and Robbie – production (1, 2, 6-8), additional production (5), mixing (1, 2, 5-8)\nTommyD – production (5)\nGarry Hughes – additional production (2, 6-8) \nKevin Petrie – additional production, engineer (3, 4, 9-11)\nPaul Taylor – additional production, mixing (4, 9)\nPete Craigie – additional production, mixing (4, 9)\nGregg Jackman – mixing (3, 10, 11)\nTrevor Key – booklet cover photography\nBen Kelly – art direction (from an original idea by Marcel Duchamp)\nAssorted Images – artwork\nJill Furmanovsky – booklet photography\nEugene Adebari – booklet photography\nGavin Evans – booklet photography\nRob Dickins – executive producer\n\n2016 reissue bonus tracks\nLouchie Lou and Michie One – vocals (17, 19)\nSuggs – production (12, 13, 15, 16)\nMike Barson – production (12-16)\nSly and Robbie – production (17)\nGarry Hughes – additional production (17)\nThe Rapino Brothers – production (19) \nBobby Dee – production (19)\nGregg Jackman – engineering, mixing (19)\nCollin \"Bulby\" York – remix (disc two: 1, 2)\nPepperoni – remix (disc two: 8, 9)\n\nCharts\n\nReferences\n\nSuggs (singer) albums\n1995 debut albums\nAlbums produced by Sly and Robbie\nWarner Records albums"}

{"id": "4048071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Alexandre%20Monsigny", "title": "Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny", "text": "Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny ( – ) was a French composer and a member of the French Académie des Beaux-Arts (1813).\n\nHe is considered alongside André Grétry and François-André Danican Philidor to have been the founder of a new musical genre, the opéra comique, laying a path for other French composers such as François-Adrien Boieldieu, Daniel-François-Esprit Auber, Charles Gounod, Georges Bizet, and Jules Massenet in this genre.\n\nBiography\nPierre-Alexandre Monsigny was born at Fauquembergues, near Saint-Omer, in the former Artois region of France (now Pas-de-Calais), four months before the marriage of his parents, Marie-Antoinette Dufresne and Nicolas Monsigny.\n\nHe was educated at the Walloon Collége des Jésuites in Saint-Omer. It was here that he first discovered his aptitude for music.\n\nAs the eldest child, in 1749, a few months after his father's death, he left for Paris with only a few coins in his pocket, a violin and a recommendation letter, in an attempt to further his musical career and provide for his siblings. He entered into the service of the connoisseur of art and the theater, Louis Guillaume Baillet de Saint-Julien, in the bureau of the Comptabilité du Clergé de France. In 1752, after watching a performance of La serva padrona by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi at the Paris Opera, he decided upon his true vocation. He then became Pietro Gianotti's student, and a contra-bassist at the Paris Opéra.\n\nSecretly, with a text by La Ribardière, he wrote Les aveux indiscrets, his first comic opera, which premiered at the theater of the Foire St Germain in February 1759. This work was well received, and that encouraged him to compose a second opera, in two acts, on a libretto by Pierre-René Lemonnier. Le maître en droit, the following year, received the same positive public response. Michel-Jean Sedaine, a well-liked librettist, proposed to Monsigny a collaboration, following Le cadi dupé success. Their common production was excellent: On ne s'avise jamais de tout, Le roi et le fermier and Rose et Colas. On 15 April 1766, at the Académie royale de Musique, his epic ballet in three acts Aline, reine de Golconde was not as successful as expected. The critics were harsher two years later, with L'île sonnante. The music, it is true, preserves its usual grace of Monsigny's touch. However, Charles Collé's libretto happened to be ill-adapted to the stage and justified the work's lack of success.\n\nIt is during this same year of 1768 that the composer purchased the post of maître d'hôtel in the service of the great courtier Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orléans. A place in the entourage of this patron proved favorable to Monsigny's inspiration. Michel-Jean Sedaine submitted his libretto, Le déserteur, for which he composed his most successful score. Yet Le faucon, created in 1771 was a failure. On 17 August 1775, La belle Arsène caused controversy among critics.\n\nIn 1777, following the success of Félix, ou L'enfant trouvé, Monsigny stopped composing. At the beginning of 1784, he married Amélie de Villemagne, with whom he lived peacefully until 1789. The French Revolution and The Terror deprived them of all their material existence. The musician and his family sank into deep misery and oblivion for a few years. Hearing of the composer's state of poverty, the members of the Opéra-Comique gave him a pension of 2400 pounds, in order to prove their gratitude to one of the founders of their theater.\n\nThe years of adversity came to an end and Monsigny reached once again his deserved success. He became inspector of teaching at the Conservatoire de Musique de Paris. In 1804, he received the title of Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur. In 1813, he succeeded Grétry at the institute. He was totally blind during his last years. Monsigny died in Paris.\n\nWorks\n\nSee List of operas by Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nNoiray, Michel (1992), 'Monsigny, Pierre-Alexandre' in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed.

It could be taken as a platform for telegram distribution, where each computer in the net works as a host and as a server.\n\n As a host: messages are sent, active nodes are sought, etc.\n As a server: text messages and requests to increase the connectivity between nodes are routed to the network using a broadcast forwarding method.\n\nThere are four message distribution lists, so receivers only receive messages sent to the list they are interested in: General, Technology, Philosophy, and Politics.\n\nContent filters are allowed, so only messages with certain patterns are displayed. This is specially useful when searching for some specific information because Marabunta just selects potentially interesting messages.\n\nConnections \n\nAll generated traffic uses the UDP/IP protocols. Avoiding setting up connections between nodes lets more traffic flow in the network and the operational redundancy of every node can be used. Moreover, the UDP protocol could be seen as increasing the anonymity in the net because there is no need to validate source hosts to receive a datagram.\n\nPort-forwarding on NATs \n\nMarabunta does not support UDP hole punching, so users behind NATs have to establish a port forwarding route to let the router know to which port and node of the internal net it should forward the arriving datagrams.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n  Marabunta home page  (Software does display in Spanish by default.

The Sound Factory was an integral venue during a peak period of house music in New York. Prominent DJs, artists, and parties appeared at the club. It was in operation from 1989 to 1995. There were other reincarnations of the club until 2004.\n\nHistory \nIn 1989, Christine Visca, Phil Smith and Richard Grant opened the Sound Factory in a converted warehouse at 530 West 27th Street in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. DJ Junior Vasquez's association with vogue-ball houses the House of Xtravaganza and the House of Aviance helped bring the Harlem ballroom scene to the downtown club scene.\n\nSmith became increasingly involved in The Sound Factory Bar, a smaller offshoot gay club. The owners of the Sound Factory were at risk of losing their cabaret license and decided to close the club in 1995.\n\nIn 1995, Smith converted the venue into the nightclub Twilo, which closed in 2001.\n\nGrant reopened a new club called SoundFactory in a warehouse at 618 West 46th Street, but after facing legal issues in 2004, the club was closed.\n\nThe Sound Factory Bar \nThe Sound Factory Bar was an offshoot at 12 West 21st Street that was in operation from 1992 to 1997. The club was previously called Private Eyes which was a popular nightspot in the late 1980s and the early 1990s that for its time had an unusually advanced state-of-the-art video and sound system. In the mid 1990s Private Eyes was then purchased by 2 of the 3 owners of The Sound Factory, and, since the space was smaller, it was renamed the Sound Factory Bar.\n\nWhen the Sound Factory closed in 1995, the Sound Factory Bar continued to operate. Wednesdays housed the recently resurrected Underground Network parties, hosted and promoted by recording artist Barbara Tucker and Don Welch, with Grammy Award winner Little Louie Vega as resident DJ. On Thursday nights, \"Factoria 21,\" a tribal house gay night with DJ Merritt and Lord G, and on Friday nights, \"Godfather of House\" Frankie Knuckles helmed the decks. On Sunday afternoons, it was the host for \"Body Positive Tea Dances,\" a social for HIV positive men and their friends. The DJs were Mark Cicero and Mark Thomas. Closing out the weekend on Sunday evenings, \"Purgatory\" a tribal and progressive house gay night with DJ Merritt and DJ Andrew Tonio. One of the most notorious events was a weekly party called MILK Mondays from DJ TPromix that after several years at this location went on to thrive for 9 years around the city.

{"id": "4048091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCAspace", "title": "ARCAspace", "text": "Romanian Cosmonautics and Aeronautics Association (), also known as ARCAspace, is an aerospace company based in Râmnicu Vâlcea, Romania. It builds rockets, high-altitude balloons, and unmanned aerial vehicles. It was founded in 1999 as a non-governmental organization in Romania by the Romanian engineer and entrepreneur Dumitru Popescu and other rocket and aeronautics enthusiasts. Since then, ARCA has launched two stratospheric rockets and four large-scale stratospheric balloons including a cluster balloon. It was awarded two governmental contracts with the Romanian government and one contract with the European Space Agency. ARCASpace is currently developing a three-stage, semi-reusable steam-powered rocket called EcoRocket and in 2022 has shifted its business model to Asteroid mining.\n\nHistory\n\n1999–2004: Demonstrator rocket family \n\nARCA was established as Romanian Cosmonautics and Aeronautics Association (), a non-governmental organization in 1999 by a group of rocket and aeronautics enthusiasts. Their goal was to construct and launch space rockets. \nAfter experimenting with designs for different fuels and rocket engine types, including solid fuel rockets, they decided to use fiberglass for engine and tank construction and hydrogen peroxide as fuel. \nTheir first vehicle was named Demonstrator and was a  long, unguided, self-stabilized rocket. It never flew, instead it was used in various public exhibitions to attract funds and sponsorships. Their second rocket, Demonstrator 2, was constructed in 2003. For this, ARCA created their first rocket engine testing installation where they tested their hydrogen peroxide engine. After the tests were successful, they constructed Demonstrator 2B which was an improved version of their previous rocket. It had a  length and  diameter and used an  high launch pad.\n\nIn 2003 ARCA also signed up for the Ansari X Prize international competition and started design for the Orizont suborbital vehicle capable of carrying a crew of two up to an altitude of . Orizont was to be ARCA's competing vehicle for the Ansari X Prize. It was designed to use a disposable jet engine up to an altitude of  and then ignite its main hydrogen peroxide rocket engine in order to propel it to the  altitude.\n\nOn September 9, 2004, ARCA successfully launched the Demonstrator 2B rocket from Cape Midia Air Force Base. Because of powerful wind gusts up to , they were forced to use only 20 percent of the intended fuel quantity in order to keep with the allocated safety zone by the Air Force. The altitude reached was . 90 journalists from Romania, Germany, and Austria were present at the launch. After the launch, ARCA started construction of the Orizont spaceplane and completed the aircraft structure by 2005.\n\n2005–2010: Stabilo and Helen rockets \n\nARCA organized a public presentation of their Orizont spaceplane in front of the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest. Because of financial problems encountered with the construction of Orizont, ARCA decided to suspend its development and instead design a new, much smaller rocket called Stabilo. It was designed to be launched from a stratospheric solar balloon and carry one person into space. Design and construction of large scale polyethylene balloons started and on December 2, 2006, at Onesti, Bacau, the crew capsule of Stabilo rocket was lifted to an altitude of 14,700 m. The capsule was safely recovered that evening. The event was transmitted live on several Romanian TV stations.\n\nOn 27 September 2007, the entire Stabilo rocket (crew capsule + rocket booster) was lifted to an altitude of 12,000 m using the largest solar balloon constructed until that date. The mission was launched from Cape Midia Air Force Base, and the rocket was recovered from the Black Sea surface by Romanian Navy divers. At this moment ARCA proved its ability to conduct large-scale operations and to coordinate military institutions like the Romanian Navy and the Romanian Air Force.\n\nIn 2007 ARCA won two governmental contracts with the Research Ministry for a suborbital rocket and a solar balloon. The Romanian Space Agency, the University of Bucharest and other Romanian institutions were subcontractors to ARCA for these projects.\n\nIn early 2008 ARCA joined the Google Lunar X Prize competition and designed the Haas orbital launcher. Their lunar rover was named European Lunar Lander and used a monopropellant rocket engine for landing and hovering. Haas was a three-stage orbital rocket powered by hybrid engines using a bitumen-based fuel and hydrogen peroxide as oxidizer. It was supposed to be launched from 18,000 m carried by the largest solar balloon ever constructed, having a volume of 2 million cubic meters. For the Haas rocket, they created a three-stage much smaller demonstrator called Helen that was intended to test technologies and operation. The Helen rocket was intentionally not aerodynamically stabilized, being intended to use a technique based on the pendulum rocket fallacy. The Romanian bank BRD – Groupe Société Générale awarded ARCA a 300,000 euro sponsorship for their activities. Romanian cosmonaut Dumitru Prunariu highly praised ARCA's achievements and noted their ability to efficiently utilize private funds. In 2009 ARCA performed a series of engine tests using the Stabilo rocket engine in order to validate the design for the Helen rocket.\n\nThe first attempt to launch the Helen rocket took place on November 14, 2009. Romanian Naval Forces participated with the NSSL 281 Constanta ship, the Venus divers ship, the Fulgerul fast boat and two other fast craft boats. For this mission, ARCA constructed a massive 150,000 cubic meter solar balloon, approximately five times as large as their previous balloon. After the balloon began inflating, the mission crew discovered that the balloon inflation arms were wrapped around the lower part of the balloon. Inflation was halted and the crew attempted to unwrap the arms. Three hours later the arms were repositioned and inflation was ready to resume but the sun was already nearing the horizon, and heating the solar balloon was no longer possible. The decision was made to cancel the mission.\n\nARCA decided to redesign the Helen rocket to use two stages and a helium balloon instead. They named the rocket Helen 2. On April 27, 2010, they performed an avionics test for the European Lunar Lander payload to be lifted by the Helen 2 rocket, using a hot air balloon that lifted three ARCA members to 5,200 m altitude. On August 4, 2010, a new attempt to launch the rocket was made, but a construction error in the helium balloon caused it to rupture and the mission was aborted. A new helium balloon was manufactured designed to carry only the second stage of Helen 2 rocket. On October 1, 2010, the rocket performed a successful flight to an altitude of 38,700 m reaching a maximum velocity of 2320 km/h. Upon atmospheric reentry the rocket capsule parachute failed to deploy and the capsule was lost at sea, but the data was transmitted to the mission control center on the 281 Constanta ship and to the Romanian Air Traffic Services Administration.\n\n2011–2013: IAR-111 aircraft, Executor engine and Haas rocket family \n\nAfter the difficulties encountered with the stratospheric balloons, ARCA decided to change their approach to orbital launch for the Google Lunar X Prize. They designed a supersonic rocket plane powered by a liquid-fueled rocket engine using kerosene as fuel and liquid oxygen as oxidizer. The aircraft, initially named E-111, was renamed IAR-111 after ARCA received permission from IAR S.A. Brasov to use the traditional IAR designation for military and civilian aircraft constructed since 1925. The aircraft was intended to fly to an altitude of 17.000 m and launch a heavily modified version of the Haas rocket, named Haas 2. Haas 2 was an air-launched three-stage orbital rocket intended to place a 200 kg payload into orbit. Work on the plane structure began in late 2010.\n\nBy 2011 all the fiberglass molds for the aircraft were finished and one-third of the aircraft structure was completed. The crew capsule escape system was tested on September 26, 2011, when a Mil Mi-17 helicopter belonging to the Special Aviation Unit dropped the capsule from an altitude of 700 m over the Black Sea. The emergency parachute deployed successfully and the capsule was recovered from the sea surface by the Romanian Coast Guard.\n\nIn 2012 ARCA decided to focus on the construction of the rocket engine of the IAR-111 aircraft. The engine, named Executor, is made of composite materials, has a thrust of 24 tons force (52,000 lbf) and is turbopump fueled. It uses ablative cooling for the main chamber and nozzle where the outer layers of the composite material vaporize in contact with the high temperature exhaust mixture and prevent overheating. ARCA also presented a long-term space program, until 2025, that besides IAR-111 envisioned a small scale orbital rocket (Haas 2C), a suborbital crewed rocket (Haas 2B) and a medium scale crewed orbital rocket (Super Haas). In March 2012, ARCA tested an extremely lightweight composite materials kerosene tank that is intended to be used for the Haas 2C rocket.\n\nAfter criticism from the Romanian Space Agency (ROSA) intensified in printed media and television, ARCA decided to send a public letter to the Romanian Prime Minister to intervene in this matter. ARCA mentioned that the Romanian Space Agency is in no position to criticize after the failure of their cubesat Goliat recently launched with a Vega rocket. Furthermore, ARCA was privately funded compared with ROSA which uses public funding.\n\nIn June 2012 ARCA presented their Haas 2C rocket in Victoria Square in Bucharest, in front of the Romanian Government palace. The same year ARCA won a $1,200,000 contract with the European Space Agency to participate in the ExoMars program. Named the High Altitude Drop Test, the contract consisted of a series of stratospheric balloon drop tests to verify the structural integrity of the EDM parachutes used in Martian atmospheric deceleration.\n\nOn September 16, 2013, ARCA performed the first successful flight in the ExoMars program, lifting three pressurised avionics containers over the Black Sea to an altitude of 24,400 m.\nIn November, the concrete test stand for the Executor engine was completed.\n\n2014–2019: AirStrato to Launch Assist System \n\nOn February 10 ARCA presented a high-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle, named AirStrato, that was meant to replace stratospheric balloon usage for equipment testing and other near space missions. It was intended to be solar powered for extended endurance, was 7 m in length and had a 16 m wingspan with a takeoff weight of 230 kg. The aircraft first flew on February 28. ARCA announced that if the development was successful they would consider developing a commercial version available for sale to customers.\n\nOn October 17, 2014, ARCA announced that it had transferred its headquarters to the United States to Las Cruces, New Mexico. In a press release they announced that in Romania activities related to software and rocket engine development will continue. They also announced that Air Strato UAV would be available for purchase to customers and that Las Cruces will also serve as a production center for the aircraft. On November 25 they released a website for the UAV revealing two models available for purchase, AirStrato Explorer that could reach altitudes up to 18,000 m with 20 hours endurance and AirStrato Pioneer that would be limited to 8000 m and 12 hours endurance.\n\nOn July 13, 2015 ARCA announced the beginning of activities in New Mexico, including production and flight tests of AirStrato UAS and Haas rockets, investing .\n\nIn November 2017, CEO Dimitru Popescu was arrested and charged with 12 counts of fraud. As a result, he left the country and reestablished operations in Romania. The charges were later dropped.\n\nIn early 2019, ARCA announced the development of the steam-powered Launch Assist System and began testing the aerospike engine.\n\n2020–Present: EcoRocket, AMi, and Pivot to Asteroid Mining \nIn 2020, tests of the steam-powered aerospike continued and ARCA announced a new launch vehicle, the EcoRocket, derived from the LAS technology.\n\nIn 2021, the EcoRocket design was altered slightly to a three-stage vehicle as tests of the steam-powered aerospike continued.\n\nIn 2022, ARCA announced the AMi Exploration Initiative, effectively pivoting its business model away from the commercial launch sector and towards cryptocurrency and asteroid mining. The AMi program will utilize the AMi Cargo vehicle and EcoRocket Heavy to mine valuable materials from asteroids. Beginning in the late 2020s, the company plans to start a series of asteroid mining missions to return valuable metals (mostly platinum) to Earth for sale. It intends to fund this venture primarily through the sales of the AMi token, an upcoming cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nVehicles\n\nHaas rocket family\n\nThe Haas rocket family was to be a series of rockets of various sizes and configurations intended to replace the initial Haas balloon-launched rocket. After the difficulties encountered with balloon operation in Mission 3 and Mission 4, ARCA decided to redesign the rocket to be ground-launched. Although heavier and more expensive, ground-launched rockets are more reliable, easier to operate and can carry heavier payloads into orbit.\n\nHaas 2B \n\nHaas 2B was to be a single-stage suborbital rocket intended for space tourism. It was designed to transport a crew capsule and service module into a suborbital trajectory. The crew capsule and service module would have been the same as the ones used for the larger multi-stage Super Haas orbital rocket. At the NASA DC-X conference in Alamogordo, New Mexico in August 2013 ARCA presented an updated version of the Haas 2B rocket with a capsule capable of carrying a crew of five into space. There were discussions with Spaceport America representatives to operate the Haas 2B rocket from New Mexico.\n\nHaas 2C \n\nHaas 2C was to be an orbital rocket intended for commercial payload launches. There were two planned variants of the rocket, a single stage to orbit variant capable of placing a  payload into orbit and a two-stage variant capable of lifting a  payload into orbit. After testing the extremely lightweight composite tank, ARCA designed a single stage  long rocket with a total weight of , having a thrust-to-weight ratio of 26:1 and a  payload. The company displayed the rocket in Victoria Square in Bucharest, in front of the Romanian Government building. The second stage version was to be powered by the Executor engine for the lower stage, and the upper stage use a smaller engine adapted for vacuum, named Venator.\n\nHaas 2CA \nHaas 2CA was to be a rocket designed to be able to launch 100 kg into a low-Earth orbit, at a price of US$1 million per launch. The first flight was intended to launch from Wallops Flight Facility in 2018. The rocket was designed as a Single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) and featured an Aerospike engine, producing  of thrust at sea level and  of thrust in vacuum.\n\nIAR-111 rocket plane\n\nRomanian Aeronautical Industry Brașov (), also known as IAR-111, was a sea-launched suborbital rocket plane.  It used the same Executor engine as Haas 2B and 2C rockets. It was to have a length of , a wingspan of  and a take-off mass of . It can carry a crew of two, a pilot and a passenger. The flight sequence consists of take-off from sea surface, horizontal flight at subsonic speed, followed by a rapid climb to an altitude of  in approximately two minutes. As a space tourism development platform, it could reach  at . After fuel depletion, IAR-111 was to descend in gliding flight and land on the sea surface. In case of emergency, the crew capsule was to be detachable and equipped with two rocket-propelled parachutes.\n\nThe IAR-111 capsule was flight tested during Mission 6. The mission took place in cooperation with the Special Aviation Unit and the Coast Guard, belonging to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration.\n\nAirStrato unmanned aerial vehicle\n\nAirStrato was an electric powered medium-sized unmanned aerial vehicle that was being developed by ARCA. There were two variants planned, the AirStrato Explorer with a target flight ceiling of 18,000 m and AirStrato Pioneer with a target flight ceiling of 8000 m. It was supposed to carry a 45 kg payload consisting of surveillance equipment, scientific instruments, or additional battery pods for extended autonomy. The first prototype's maiden flight took place on February 28, 2014. It was equipped with fixed landing gear. Two more prototypes were constructed that lacked landing gear. Instead, ARCA opted for a pneumatic catapult as a launcher and landing skids and a recovery parachute for landing. Both prototypes only performed take-off and landing testing and short low-altitude flights.\n\nESA Drop Test Vehicle\n\nARCA has constructed a drop test vehicle for the European Space Agency intended to test the atmospheric deceleration parachutes for the ExoMars EDM lander module. It has the same weight and parachute deployment systems present on the ESA module. The DTV is intended to be lifted to an altitude of 24 km by a stratospheric helium balloon.  From that height, it will fall freely reaching a dynamic pressure similar to that encountered by the ExoMars EDM at entry into the Mars atmosphere. At that dynamic pressure the parachute will deploy and the module will land on the Black Sea surface and will be recovered by the Romanian Naval Forces.\n\nEcoRocket Demonstrator\nThe EcoRocket Demonstrator (formerly just EcoRocket) is a partially-reusable three-stage orbital launch vehicle currently under development. The EcoRocket Demonstrator is slated to launch in 2022. The vehicle's reusable first stage will use a battery-powered steam rocket to propel a small second stage to an altitude of 7 kilometers. The second stage will then proceed to a higher altitude to deploy a tiny third stage, carrying the payload. The third stage utilizes RP-1 and high test peroxide to propel a payload of up to 10 kilograms into orbit. The rocket takes its name from the supposed ecological benefits of not burning as much kerosene (despite using kerosene to achieve most of orbital velocity). The EcoRocket will launch partially submerged in the Black Sea, in a similar manner to the Sea Dragon. Both the first and second stages are intended to be reusable, parachuting back into the ocean for recovery. The vehicle is intended to demonstrate technologies for the upcoming EcoRocket Heavy.\n\nEcoRocket Heavy \nThe EcoRocket Heavy is a planned variant of EcoRocket, designed to support ARCA's AMi asteroid mining initiative. The EcoRocket heavy will be a three-stage launch vehicle derived from EcoRocket's technology. The stages will be arranged concentrically around the payload in the center (in a layout occasionally called \"onion staging\"), with the outermost stage firing, then detaching and allowing the next outermost stage to ignite, and so on. The EcoRocket heavy, like the EcoRocket, will use a three-stage design, with the first two stages using steam power and the final stage using a kerosene/liquid oxygen mixture to propel itself to orbit. Each stage will consist of multiple \"propulsion modules\" attached together, in a manner many commentators have compared to the now-defunct German launch company OTRAG. The vehicle will be thirty meters in diameter, and, like the EcoRocket Demonstrator, will launch from the ocean, and be partially reusable, recovering the first two stages. The EcoRocket Heavy largely abandons aerospike engines, using only traditional rocket nozzles.\n\nAMi Cargo \nThe AMi Cargo vehicle is the vehicle designed to support ARCA's asteroid mining operations, and as the primary payload for the EcoRocket Heavy. The AMi Cargo vehicle will approach an asteroid, and then release the battery-powered Recovery Capsule (which appears to be derived from the earlier suborbital capsule for the Haas 2B), which will use the engine on its service module to approach the target asteroid. The spacecraft will then harpoon the asteroid, then reel itself in to begin mining operations. Upon completion of mining, it will return to the AMi Cargo vehicle, which will propel it back to Earth. Upon reaching Earth, the capsule will detach and jettison the service module prior to reentry. The capsule will then splash down under parachute for recovery of the material inside. ARCA intends to eventually upgrade the spacecraft for uncrewed missions to other planets. To support deep space operations, ARCA intends to construct their own Deep Space Network, akin to NASA's system.\n\nRocket engines\n\nExecutor\n\nThe Executor was a liquid-fueled rocket engine intended to power the IAR-111 Excelsior supersonic plane and Haas 2B and 2C rockets. Executor was an open cycle gas generator rocket engine, that uses liquid oxygen and kerosene and has a maximum thrust of 24 tons force. ARCA decided to use composite materials and aluminum alloys on a large scale. The composite materials offer low construction costs and reduced weight of the components. They were used in the construction of the combustion chamber and the nozzle, and also the gas generator and some elements in the turbopumps. The combustion chamber and the nozzle are built from two layers. The internal layer is made of silica fiber and phenolic resin, and the external one is made of carbon fiber and epoxy resin. The phenolic resin reinforced with silica fiber pyrolyzes endothermally in the combustion chamber walls, releasing gases like oxygen and hydrogen, leaving a local carbon matrix. The gases spread through the carbon matrix and reach the internal surface of the wall where they meet the hot combustion gases and act as a cooling agent. Furthermore, the engine is equipped with a cooling system that injects 10 percent of the total kerosene mass onto the internal walls.\n\nThe pump volutes were made of 6062 type aluminum alloy. The pump rotors are made through lathing and milling using 304 type steel. The supersonic turbine was made of refractory steel, both the core and the blades. The turbine rotation speed was 20,000 rpm and has a 1.5 MW power. The intake gas temperature was 620 °C. The main engine valves were made of 6060 type aluminum and were pneumatically powered, without adjustment.  The engine injector and the liquid oxygen intake pipes were made of 304 L type steel and the kerosene intake pipe was made of composite materials. The engine had the possibility to shift the thrust by 5 degrees on two axes. The articulated system was made of composite materials and high-grade steel alloy. The engine is rotated using two hydraulic pistons that use kerosene from the pump exhaust system.\n\nARCA announced that the Executor engine had a thrust/mass ratio of 110.\n\nVenator\n\nVenator was a liquid-fueled pressure-fed rocket engine that will be used to power the second stage of the Haas 2C rocket. It burned liquid oxygen and kerosene and had a maximum thrust of . The engine had no valves on the main pipes. Instead, it used burst disks on the main pipes, between the tanks and the engine. The second stage was pressurized at  at lift-off and after the first stage burn-out, the second stage would be pressurized at 16 atm. At that pressure the disks would burst and the fuel would flow through the engine.\n\nLAS\nThe Launch Assist System was an aerospike engine that was to use electrically heated water to produce steam, which would then generate thrust. The LAS was to reduce cost of rockets by manner of reducing the associated complexity, since steam powered rockets are far less complex than even the simplest liquid fueled engines. It was to be a self contained unit including both the engine and propellant tank. It could theoretically achieve a specific impulse of 67 seconds. The LAS was proposed to be a first stage for the Haas 2CA rocket, or to serve as a strap-on booster for existing vehicles, including the Atlas V, Falcon 9, Delta IV, and Ariane 6. The EcoRocket Demonstrator and Heavy will use a reworked version of this system with two nozzles (one for launch, and one for landing) called the LAS 25D.\n\nAMi Propulsion System \nThe AMi Cargo vehicle will use a new propulsion system, described by ARCA as \"electric-arc propulsion.\" The reaction mass will be water, and the impulse will be provided electrically using electricity from large solar arrays. Beyond this, not much is known about the nature of this system, however, ARCA intends it to be capable of running for days on end.\n\nMissions\n\nMission 1\n\nMission 1 took place on December 2, 2006, when a solar balloon carried the STABILO system capsule to an altitude of . The altitude was slightly lower than intended because of extreme turbulence encountered during the last stage of the flight. In light of this, it was decided not to risk damaging the system.\n\nThe flight had been planned since August 2006, when another large solar balloon was launched at low altitude in controlled flight. During this time a specially designed parachute was tested. It was the first stratospheric flight performed by ARCA, and the event was transmitted live; over 20 journalists were present.\n\nMission 2\n\nMission 2 of STABILO 1B was launched on 27 September 2007 from Cape Midia Air Force Base. The Romanian Air Force participated with two radar stations.  Civil Aviation and the Romanian Navy also participated, the latter with one naval diver's ship. The first and second vehicle stages reached an altitude of . After one hour and 30 minutes and having traveled  from the launch location, STABILO landed on the sea surface and was intercepted by a Navy Saturn ship and recovered by divers. The recovery ship was guided by the satellite transmission system and by Air Force radar. The vehicle was transported to the Navy shipyard. The electronic equipment continued to transmit to the command center even 8 hours after the flight had ended.\n\nMission 3, 4 and 4B \n\nHelen was a demonstrator rocket for the Haas balloon-launched orbital rocket. It was intended to test in flight the avionics and gravitational stabilization method proposed for the much larger Haas rocket. Helen was intended to reach an altitude of . Two versions were created, a three-stage rocket that had cylindrical tanks and used hydrogen peroxide as monopropellant fuel, and a two-stage spherical tank rocket that used the same propulsion type. The rocket used a physically flawed stabilization technique based on the pendulum rocket fallacy.\n\nMission 3 took place on November 14, 2009, on the Black Sea. Romanian Naval Forces participated in the mission with one logistical ship, one diver's ship and another fast craft. For this mission, ARCA constructed the largest stratospheric helium balloon to date. An error in construction caused the balloon's inflation arms to wrap around the base of the balloon when it was inflated. The team managed to unwrap the arms and resume inflation but sunset was approaching and the solar balloon could no longer be used. The mission was cancelled.\n\nFor Mission 4 ARCAspace decided to use a helium balloon instead and to redesign the Helen rocket. The new version, named Helen 2, was prepared for flight on August 4, 2010. When balloon inflation was initiated, the balloon ruptured because of a construction error and the mission was cancelled.\n\nA new attempt was made on October 1, 2010, by using only the final stage of the Helen 2 rocket and a smaller helium balloon. The flight, named Mission 4B, was successful, Helen 2 launching at an altitude of  and the rocket reaching an altitude of . After the difficulties encountered with stratospheric balloons, ARCA decided to stop work on the Haas rocket and design a new family of ground-launched orbital and suborbital rockets.\n\nMission 5\n\nMission 5 was carried out in partnership with the Romanian Air Club and the Romanian Aeronautic Federation. It took place before the Helen 2 rocket launch. The flight took place on April 27, 2010, between 07:45 and 08:45 AM, taking off from Hogiz, Brasov. A manned hot air balloon lifted the Helen 2 rocket pressurised capsule to an altitude of . The maximum distance between the carrier balloon and the command center at Sanpetru airfield was , which corresponded with the Helen 2 rocket simulated safety zone. The balloon crew was composed of Mihai Ilie – pilot, Mugurel Ionescu – copilot, and Dumitru Popescu – ELL equipment operator. The objective of the flight was to test telemetry, command and live TV transmission for the Helen 2 rocket.\n\nMission 6\n\nMission 6 tested the recovery system for the IAR-111 supersonic plane crew capsule. On September 26, 2011, a Mi-17 helicopter from Special Aviation Unit lifted the capsule to  above mean sea level.\nAt that altitude, the helicopter released the capsule. The parachute deployed, and the capsule landed on the sea surface. It was recovered by the same helicopter with the help of the Romanian Coast Guard.\n\nWP3\n\nWP3 was a validation test flight for the ExoMars Program High Altitude Drop Test (HADT), carried out in cooperation with the European Space Agency. The launch took place from the Black Sea coast on September 16, 2013, and the hardware comprised three pressurized containers containing the avionics equipment that will be necessary to test the ExoMars spacecraft parachute during future incoming flights.\nThe pressurized containers, carried by a cluster balloon, were launched at 7:15 AM and the ascension took 90 minutes. When the containers reached an altitude of , they were released under a dedicated recovery parachute and landed on the sea twenty minutes later. The containers and the recovery parachute were recovered by the Navy  from the launch point.\n\nThe objectives were flight testing the avionics and communication systems, demonstrating the container sealing after sea landing and the capability to identify and recover the equipment from the sea surface.\n\nMission 9\n\nMission 9 was to be a short vertical hop of the EcoRocket's first stage, testing the booster landing system in much the same manner as SpaceX's Starhopper. This mission has apparently been scrapped, however, ARCA completed a short, low-altitude flight of the EcoRocket Demonstrator's second stage in the fall of 2021 with no landing attempt to test the RCS systems aboard the rocket. The stage was attached to an umbilical during the flight.\n\nMission 10\nMission 10 will be the first orbital flight of the EcoRocket.\n\nSee also \n\nArcaBoard\nRomanian Space Agency\nRockoon\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n Ansari X Prize official site \n Latest ARCA Space, Space Fellowship news\n Google Lunar X Prize official site  \n National Plan for Research Development and Innovation\n\nSpace advocacy\nScience and technology in Romania\nPrivate spaceflight companies\nGoogle Lunar X Prize"}
{"id": "4048100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%20wrist-guard", "title": "Stone wrist-guard", "text": "Early Bronze Age stone wrist-guards are found across Europe from around 2400-1900 BC and are closely associated with the Beaker culture and Unetice culture. In the past they have been variously known as stone bracers, stone arm-guards and armlets, although \"stone wrist-guard\" is currently the favoured terminology; and it is no longer thought that they were functional archer's bracers.\n\nDescription\n\nThe wrist-guards are small rectangles of stone (often slate) with a number of perforations, typically between two and six, which might allow attachment to the arm with cord. One, from Hemp Knoll in Wiltshire, had markings which clearly indicate its attachment to the arm by two cords. The shapes of the wrist-guard are stereotyped, and common forms exhibit a narrowed 'waist' and curved cross-section (presumably so they fit the arm better). \n\nStone wrist-guards are exclusively found in the graves of males, frequently lying next to the body's wrist. Rare examples – three in Great Britain – use rare imported greenstone and are decorated with gold-capped rivets or foil, clearly representing an elite form. The three British examples are from burials at Driffield and Barnack in England, and Culduthel Mains in Scotland.\n\nOriginal use\n\nIt was originally thought that these stone wrist-guards were bracers, used by archers to protect their bow arms from the string of the bow. However, recent research has highlighted that (in Britain at least) they do not commonly occur in graves in association with arrowheads (the Amesbury Archer being a notable exception), nor are they commonly found on the part of the arm that would need protection from the bowstring (on a right-handed archer, the inside left wrist). They are usually found on the outside of the arm, where they would have been more conspicuous. Many have only two holes which would make them difficult to fasten securely to the arm, and some have projecting rivets which would catch on the bowstring and make them unsuitable for use as a bracer.\n\nWhen the objects occur in barrows, they always occur in the central primary grave, a place thought to be reserved for heads of family and other important people. Many show great skill in polishing and stone working, and few are found in areas from which their stone originates. It seems likely that, as found in graves, these objects were used as symbols of status within family groups. They may have been status symbols of prowess in hunting or war, possibly mounted as decorations on functional bracers. However, one at least (from Barnack in Cambridgeshire) had eighteen holes and each one was filled with a foil-thin disc of gold; these caps would have prohibited any form of rivet or cord being used as a means of attachment. A few prehistoric wrist-guards made of gold or amber have also been found; these are generally accepted not to be functional.\n\nFamous burials containing stone wrist-guards include the Amesbury Archer and the Barnack burial.\n\nTerminology \nThe wrist-guards are commonly classified following either the 1970 Atkinson classification (cited in Clarke 1970) or the 2006 Smith classification. Of the two, it is the 2006 Smith classification which is less rigid and more descriptive. It uses a three-character system to classify the objects on three simple characteristics:\n\nTotal number of perforations: (e.g. 2, 4, 6 etc.)\n\nShape in plan: described as-\n'Waisted', having a narrow midsection\n'Tapered', having narrow ends\n'Straight-sided', having a rectangular plan\n\nShape in transverse cross-section: described as-\n'Curved', having a concavo-convex cross-section\n'Plano-Convex', having a plano-convex cross-section, (i.e. one side flat and the other curved)\n'Flat', having a flat or slightly bi-convex cross-section\n\nThe most common types of wrist-guard are the 'tapered variety' consisting of 2TFs, 'straight variety' consisting mainly of 4SFs and 6SFs and the 'waisted variety' consisting mainly of 4WCs\n\nThis is how the 1970 Atkinson classification translates into the newer classificatory system:\n\nA1 = 2TF\n\nA2 = 4TF\n\nB1 = 2SF\n\nB2 = 4SF\n\nB3 = 6SF\n\nC1 = 4WC\n\nC2 = 2WC\n\nReferences \n\nLithics\nArchaeological artefact types\nArchaeology in Europe\nBronze Age Europe\nArchery\nHistory of archery\nWrist"}

{"id": "4048111", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation%20Sail", "title": "Operation Sail", "text": "Operation Sail refers to a series of sailing events held to celebrate special occasions and features sailing vessels from around the world. Each event is coordinated by Operation Sail, Inc., a non-profit organization established in 1961 by U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and must be approved by the United States Congress. Often referred to as OpSail or Op Sail, the event has the goals of promoting good will and cooperation between countries while providing sail training and celebrating maritime history. It is also sometimes erroneously referred to as \"Tall Ships\". While the tall ships form the centerpiece of the event, smaller sailing vessels also participate.\n\nOp Sail events, when scheduled, are run concurrently with the annual International Naval Review, which features present-day warships from various navies. Six Op Sail events have been held to date, in 1964, 1976, 1986, 1992, 2000 and 2012. The event culminates in the Parade of Ships on the Hudson River and in New York Harbor on July 4, Independence Day. The United States Coast Guard cutter Eagle has been the host vessel to all six Op Sail events.\n\nAlong with Nils Hansell, Frank Braynard launched the world's first Operation Sail, an extravaganza in which tall ships and naval vessels filled New York Harbor, in 1964.\n\nWorld's Fair Parade of Ships (1964)\n\nThe inaugural Opsail was a tie-in with the 1964 New York World's Fair.\nOperation sail 1964:  Four years in the making, Operation Sail is an international effort to promote goodwill and to generate awareness of ships and shipping. It is a dream come true for sailing enthusiasts, and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for anyone who is stirred by the sight of a square rigger under full sail.\n\nMany nations maintain sailing ships in this machine age because they believe there is no better way to build character in young men than sail training. It encourages initiative, steadfastness, leadership and personal courage .... the records of the brotherhood of the sea sparkle with innumerable examples of the value of such training. The prestige of having served aboard a windjammer is no small matter.\n\nTo reach New York for the July 14 parade up the Hudson River, some of these tall ships will have sailed from their home ports as long ago as early March. Some will have raced from Plymouth, England, to Lisbon, Portugal, then 3000 miles across the Atlantic to Bermuda rendezvous, and a 630-mile northwest run, in company, to New York.\n\nThese ships are specifically built for training under sail. As these tall ships plough the oceans, the men who man this great fleet are helping to forge a bond of understanding and mutual respect around the world. \nAs you visit the ships and talk with their officers, crews, and trainees, consider the thirteen participating nations, the thousands of people involved in such a gathering, the countless man hours spent in preparations which have resulted in this great spectacle OPERATION SAIL.\n\nJuly 12: Ships anchor in designated order in Gravesend Bay.\nJuly 13: 1430- Captains briefing aboard USCG 1730-2000: Reception at Chase Manhattan Bank.\nJuly 14: 1100- Ships will depart Gravesend Bay and pass official reviewing vessel, USS Randolph, and then proceed to anchorages below the George Washington Bridge.\nJuly 15: Ships move to assigned piers. 1400- Lifeboat races at U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point. 1800- Commandant USCG reception.\nJuly 16: 1200- Ticker tape parade from Battery Park to City Hall. 1400-1800- Ships open to Public.2000-0100- Grand Ball, Holland America Line Pier 40, and seamen's Church Institute.\nJuly 17: 0900- Captains Symposium, Maritime Exchange. 1000-1800- Ships open to public. 1215- American Institute of Marine Underwriter's luncheon for Captains at India House.\nJuly 18: World's Fair Day, Singer Bowl.

{"id": "4048134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valea%20lui%20Mihai", "title": "Valea lui Mihai", "text": "Valea lui Mihai (; ) is a town in Bihor County, Crișana, Romania.\n\nGeography\nThe town is located at the northern tip of Bihor County, around  north-east of the county seat, Oradea, on the border with Hungary. It is crossed by national road , which runs from Oradea all the way to Sighetu Marmației, on the border with Ukraine. From Valea lui Mihai, road  branches off, leading to the Hungarian border,  away, where it connects to Main road 48.\n\nHistory\nIn 1312, under Charles I, it was allowed new trade privileges and then in 1459 was also allowed tax benefits privileges for its citizens. Later it was part of the Ottoman Empire, which resulted in its depopulation, but the inhabitants subsequently returned. Thereafter, it was part of the Habsburg monarchy up until the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. Then it became part of the Kingdom of Hungary within Austria-Hungary.\n\nAfter the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of the town in the spring of 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. Valea lui Mihai officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. After the administrative unification law in 1925, the town became the seat of plasa Valea lui Mihai in Sălaj County. In August 1940, under the auspices of Nazi Germany, which imposed the Second Vienna Award, Hungary retook the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included Valea lui Mihai) from Romania. Towards the end of World War II, however, the town was taken back from Hungarian and German troops by Romanian and Soviet forces in October 1944, during the initial stages of the Battle of Debrecen; it became again part of Romania in March 1945. Following the administrative reform of 1950, Valea lui Mihai became part of Săcueni Raion within Bihor Region (renamed Oradea Region in 1952 and Crișana Region in 1960). In 1968, the old territorial division into județe was reinstituted, and Valea lui Mihai became part of Bihor County. It was declared a town on three separate occasions: in 1844, 1930, and 1989, the last time as a result of the Romanian rural systematization program.\n\nJewish history\nJews from Galicia settled around 1780, engaging in agriculture and commerce. A junior high school was opened in 1873. Anschel Bak opened a printing press in the late 19th century. Fifty Hungarian Hasidic rabbis held a convention in the town in 1898.\n\nIn 1930, there were 1,535 Jews, or 19% of the total population. During the interwar period, Jews were the leaders of local industry, employing hundreds of workers. Some Zionist youth groups were founded in the 1930s. In 1935, the town was the site of the HaNoar HaTzioni national convention.\n\nThe Jewish population was sent by the Hungarian authorities to the Oradea ghetto in May 1944 and subsequently deported to Auschwitz. Some of the survivors returned briefly to the town after the war.\n\nPopulation\n\nAccording to the 2021 census, Valea lui Mihai has a population of 8,969. At the census from 2011, there were 9,668 people living within the town; of those, 81.03% were ethnic Hungarians, while 13.23% were ethnic Romanians, and 1.3% others.\n\nImage gallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Valea lui Mihai - ShtetLink\n\nPopulated places in Bihor County\nLocalities in Crișana\nTowns in Romania\nHungary–Romania border crossings\nHungarian communities in Romania"}
{"id": "4048140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enamul%20Haque%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201966%29", "title": "Enamul Haque (cricketer, born 1966)", "text": "Enamul Haque Moni (; born 27 February 1966), also known as Enamul Haq Moni, is a former Bangladeshi cricketer who played in 10 Tests and 29 ODIs from 1990 to 2003. After retiring from competitive cricket he became an umpire, and made his first appearance in an ODI between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe on 3 December 2006. He is the first Bangladeshi Test-match cricketer to umpire in international cricket.\n\nEarly years\nEnamul Haque Moni, commonly known as Moni, first came into prominence in the 1988–89 season, as he helped Bangladesh Biman cricket team to the Dhaka league title. He was selected for the national side next season, and remained an integral part of the team for more than a decade. Though he failed to impress at the highest level, he was a lot more successful against the lesser lights.\n\nIn ICC Trophy\nThough he was an all-rounder, he was most successful with his bowling in ICC Trophy cricket. In total, he took 35 wickets in three ICC Trophy tournaments, in 1990, 1994 and 1997. His most memorable match was the 2nd round encounter against Denmark in the 1990 ICC Trophy. batting first the Danes reached 233/9 from their 60 overs. In reply, the Chittagong trio Nurul Abedin (85), Akram Khan 50, & Minhajul Abedin 37 kept Bangladesh in the hunt; but it was Moni's quickfire 17* and his explosive hitting in the final over, that took Bangladesh to the target, with just 2 balls to spare. With the ball, Enamul Haque took 2/26 from 12 overs; and he was the obvious choice for the MOM award. In contrast, his biggest disappointment came in Feb. 1994, in the do-or-die game against the hosts Kenya at Nairobi. The hosts batted first scoring 295/6 from 50 overs, thanks mainly to Maurice Odumbe who scored 119. In reply, Bangladesh started their chase well with the opening pair of Jahangir Alam and Aminul Islam Bulbul putting on a 139 run partnership. After that, Minhajul Abedin contributed 68, but Moni fell for a duck, at a crucial stage of the match, and eventually Kenya won by 13 runs.\n\nMemorable innings\nIn Feb. 1992, he scored a memorable 131 against the touring West Bengal side in a 3-day match at Dhaka. Batting first the tourists scored 384/5 (decl.) left-handed No. 3 Raja Venkat scored 154, another more well known left-hander Sourav Ganguly made 129. In reply, the home side was struggling at 77/4. At this stage, Moni entered the wicket. With ever reliable Aminul Islam, he put on 104 for the 5th wicket. There was good understanding between the two, as they were involved in a number of vital partnerships down the order for Bangladesh. Aminul Islam went for 55, but Moni carried on ruthlessly demolishing the opposition bowling. Bangladesh eventually reached 302, thanks mainly to 131 by Moni. Aided by the tail enders, he went after the WB bowling. He was especially harsh on the slow bowlers, lofting them for a number of sixes. As the national stadium crowd were basking in afternoon sunshine (it was early spring), they also enjoyed batting of the highest class.\n\nPartnership with Aminul Islam\nEarly on his career, Moni enjoyed a highly successful partnership with another all rounder Aminul Islam Bulbul. As Bulbul moved up the batting order, he concentrated more on his batting, and less on his bowling. Then in December 1994, Mohammad Rafique emerged as a new all rounder for the national side.\n\nIn a sense, this was a strange partnership, as both of them were left arm slow bowlers, and useful lower order hitters. Very few sides in world cricket take two left arm slow bowlers in their side. In fact, at the time of Rafique's arrival, many thought that Moni's international career will be over, specially, given his rather indifferent form during the 5th ICC Trophy in Kenya early in 1994. Yet, right from the beginning, the two formed a wonderful combination which went on to serve the national squad throughout the '90s.\n\nIn the 2nd SAARC cricket tournament at Dhaka during Dec. 1994, they played prominent roles in taking the local side to the final. Moni took 3/25 against Sri Lanka A & Mohammad Rafique took 3/25 against India A.\n\nThe duo were in splendid form during Bangladesh's historic triumph in 1997 ICC Trophy. The pair took 31 wickets together, Rafique 19 at 10.68, Moni 12 at 18 a piece. Rafique also came good with the bat in the final. Promoted to the opening slot in a rain shortened game, he blasted 26 off only 15 deliveries; his innings including two sixes and two fours.\n\nAnd finally, they played their part in the first ever ODI win for Bangladesh against Kenya in 1998. Rafique won the MOM award for his 77 with the bat and 3/56 with the ball, Moni took 2/45 from 10 economical overs.\n\nAs an umpire\nSince, 2006, he has been serving as an international umpire.\n\nUpdated 15 July 2021\n\nSee also\n List of Test cricket umpires\n List of One Day International cricket umpires\n List of Twenty20 International cricket umpires\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1966 births\nLiving people\nBangladesh Test cricketers\nBangladesh One Day International cricketers\nBangladeshi cricketers\nChittagong Division cricketers\nCricketers at the 1999 Cricket World Cup\nBangladeshi Test cricket umpires\nBangladeshi One Day International cricket umpires\nBangladeshi Twenty20 International cricket umpires\nPeople from Comilla\nComilla Zilla School alumni\nCricketers from Chittagong Division"}

{"id": "4048163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central%20Provinces", "title": "Central Provinces", "text": "The Central Provinces was a province of British India. It comprised British conquests from the Mughals and Marathas in central India, and covered parts of present-day Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra states. Nagpur was the primary winter capital while Pachmarhi served as the regular summer retreat. It became the Central Provinces and Berar in 1903.\n\nThe Central Provinces was formed in 1861 by the merger of the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories and Nagpur Province. The district of Nimar which was administered by the Central India Agency was added in 1864. It was almost an island encircled by a sea of \"native States\" such as Bhopal State and Rewa State to the north, the Chota Nagpur States and Kalahandi State to the east, and the Nizam's territories of Hyderabad to the south and Berar to the west.\n\nGeography\nThe Central Provinces was landlocked, occupying the mountain ranges, plateaus, and river valleys in the centre of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe northernmost portion of the state extended onto the Bundelkhand upland, whose northward-flowing rivers are tributaries of the Yamuna and Ganges. The Vindhya Range runs east and west, forming the watershed between the Ganges-Yamuna basin and the Narmada River basin, which occupies the center and west of the province, and flows westward to empty into the Arabian Sea. The upper Narmada valley forms the center of the Mahakoshal region. Jabalpur (formerly Jubbulpore) lay on the upper Narmada, and was an important railway junction.\n\nThe Satpura Range divides the Narmada valley from the Deccan Plateau to the south. The Central Provinces included the northeastern portion of the Deccan, drained by tributaries of the Godavari River including the Wainganga, Wardha, and Indravati. These flow east towards the Bay of Bengal. A portion of Berar lay in the upper basin of the Tapti River, which drains westward into the Arabian Sea. The portion of the Central Provinces on the Deccan Plateau formed the Vidarbha region, which includes Nagpur, the capital of the province.\n\nThe eastern portion of the state lay in the upper Mahanadi River basin, which forms fertile rice-growing region of Chhattisgarh. The Maikal Range separates the basins of the Narmada and the Mahanadi. The Chota Nagpur Plateau extended into the northeast corner of the province.\n\nDemographics\nGeneral censuses were held in 1866, 1872, 1881, 1891 and 1901. The population in 1866 was over 9 million, and in 1872 over 9.25 million. 1869 was a famine year. There were epidemics of smallpox and cholera in 1872, 1878, and 1879. By 1881 the population had risen to 11.5 million, and by 1891 to nearly 13 million. The population in 1901 was 11,873,029, a reduction of 800,000 from 1891. The lack of summer monsoon rains in 1897 and 1900 led to widespread crop failures and huge famines in those years, and there were partial crop failures in four other years in the decade, with epidemics of cholera in seven of the ten years. A portion of the decrease (between one-eighth and one-quarter) was from emigration to Assam and other provinces of India.\n\nLinguistic regions\nThe central Provinces contained two distinct linguistic regions: Mahakoshal, consisting mainly of Hindi-speaking districts, and Vidarbha, chiefly, but not exclusively, a Marathi-speaking area. The linguistic regions could not be fully integrated as a unit.\n\nIn the 1901 census, 6,111,000 (63% percent) of the population spoke variants of Hindi, chiefly Chhattisgarhi (27%), Bundeli (15%), Bagheli (10%) and Malvi or Rajasthani (5%). 2,107,000 (20%) spoke Marathi, the majority language of Wardha, Nagpur, Chanda, and Bhandara districts, and the southern portions of Nimar, Betul, Chhindwara, and Balaghat districts. Oriya speakers numbered 1,600,000, or 13.5%, but the transfer of Sambalpur District to Bengal in 1905 reduced the number of Oriya speakers to 292,000. There were 94,000 Telugu speakers, mostly in Chanda District. Of the 730,000 who spoke other Dravidian languages, the majority spoke Gondi, and 60,000 spoke Korku. 74,000 spoke Munda languages.\n\nPolitics and administration\nThe Central Provinces were administered from 1861 to 1920 by a chief commissioner.\n\nAdministratively, the Central Provinces consisted of four divisions (Nerbudda, Jubbulpore, Nagpur, and Chhattisgarh), which were further divided into 18 districts - five districts in each division except Chhattisgarh, which had three districts. Berar was under the administrative authority of the Chief Commissioner for the Central Provinces, but administered separately. The Central Provinces also contained 15 princely states, which accounted for 31,188 square miles and a population in 1901 of 1,631,140, approximately 15% of the total population. The largest was Bastar, with an area of 13,062 miles, and the smallest was Satki, with an area of 138 square miles. The princely states were in Chhattisgarh Division, except for Makrai, which was in Hoshangabad District.\n\nSee also\nList of governors of the Central Provinces and Berar\n\nReferences\n\n Markovits, Claude (ed.)

{"id": "4048164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame%20Trees", "title": "Flame Trees", "text": "\"Flame Trees\" is a song by Australian pub rock band Cold Chisel from their 1984 album Twentieth Century. One of their best known songs, it was written by drummer Steve Prestwich and keyboardist Don Walker. On its release it reached No. 26 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart. It resurfaced in August 2011 due to download sales, peaking at No. 54 on the ARIA chart.\n\nIn January 2018, as part of Triple M's \"Ozzest 100\" of the 'most Australian' songs of all time, \"Flame Trees\" was ranked number 12.\n\nBackground\nAccording to the band's official website, Walker's inspiration for the lyrics was a combination of his memories of Grafton where he had lived as a youth, and of his romantic dreams. The music had already been written, on a bass, by Prestwich. Walker liked the music so much he requested to write some lyrics for the piece, to which Prestwich reluctantly agreed. Walker noted, \"When I received it with no words, I could tell it had an emotional profile – it gathers up the threads; there's a big key change if you can fire a cannon ball through the park on the key change you have a winner.\" Ian Moss said, \"The next day, after having like an hour's sleep, Don came in with this fantastic story. Don's one of those uni student dudes who's like, 'This project's got to be in, so I'll get it done by hook or by crook.'\" Prestwich said, \"When I heard Don's lyrics, I told him, 'Mate, I don't know if they're right for the music.' I've grown used to them now.\" Walker later said, \"I don't think it was the story he was expecting. He wasn't overjoyed when he heard the lyrics.\"\n\nWalker later said, \"In my mind, it’s a northern New South Wales song. But there’s a lot of people who love that song and in their minds, it’s set in their home towns. A lot of people finish up away from where they come from.\" Elsewhere, Walker noted that the song was \"not fiction\", and about, \"returning home after some success in the big city\".\n\nThe phrase that appears in the chorus, \"nothing else could set fire to this town\", refers back to the Cold Chisel song \"Merry Go Round\". Walker said, \"it's got this phrase in it 'I'm going to set fire to the town'.  We played that every night as we went from clubs to stadiums and every town around the place. \"Flame Trees\" was a song that was written at the end of our career, pretty much as we were breaking up. It only appears in two songs, once at the beginning of our ascent and once when the band was in a death dive.\"\n\nThe reference to flame trees instead of the jacarandas for which Grafton is famous, due to its annual Jacaranda Festival, is partly because of a TV miniseries, the BBC's The Flame Trees of Thika (1981), starring Hayley Mills, \"an old flame of the lyricist's dreams\". \nElsewhere, Walker claimed the use was because one of his bandmates was \"very sexually attracted to Hayley Mills\". However, Grafton is well known for its many specimens of the Australian native rainforest tree Brachychiton acerifolius, commonly known as the Illawarra Flame Tree, which along with the more pervasive, introduced poincianas and the town's famous (also introduced) jacarandas, set its streets ablaze every spring.\n\nMoss's then-girlfriend, Megan Williams, provides backing vocals. Prestwich had been replaced by Ray Arnott for the album Twentieth Century, but \"Flame Trees\" was one of three songs to feature Prestwich, based on a demo he had recorded before his departure. Prestwich was asked to come into the studio for the recording and made many of the production decisions, including flying Venetta Fields in for backing vocals.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe video of the song (directed by Kimble Rendall) was filmed in Oberon, New South Wales. It portrays a young man returning to his home town, meeting old friends, and remembering a past lover. The members of Cold Chisel have bit parts, except for Jimmy Barnes, who only appears courtesy of some footage from The Last Stand. Barnes said, \"The band was arguing so much that \"Flame Trees\" and the making of the clip, well, they never even told me, that's why I wasn't in it - the band weren't even talking to me at that point.\"\n\nReception\nThe Sydney Morning Herald asked, \"Is it a love song? If so, to what? It's undoubtedly one of the great Australian rock songs, but what is it? It's equally nostalgia, longing and love. A man goes back to the Australian bush town where he was raised and feels nostalgia at what he recalls, but distaste at how little things have changed.\"\n\nRecording credits\n Jimmy Barnes - lead vocals\n Ian Moss - electric guitar, backing vocals\n Don Walker - Yamaha CP70 electric grand piano, Hammond organ\n Steve Prestwich - drums\n Phil Small - fretless bass\n Megan Williams - backing vocals\n Venetta Fields - backing vocals\n\nCharts\n\nCover versions\n\nIn the 2005 Australian film Little Fish, the song is sung by The Sacred Heart School Choir from Cabramatta. The children in the choir appear in the film performing the song during a pivotal scene, and their version is repeated during the closing credits. This version was released as a single in 2006.\n\nDon Walker said of this version, \"A children's choir like that, it can't miss; they'll break your heart no matter what they sing.\" Of the scene in the movie, Walker said it was, \"uncomfortable to watch for anyone who's ever shared accommodation where heroin is part of the commerce.\"\n\nSinger Sarah Blasko also recorded a cover version for Little Fish, which was released as a stand-alone download-only single on the Australian iTunes Music Store, and later included on the 2007 tribute album Standing on the Outside: The Songs of Cold Chisel. The Blasko version of \"Flame Trees\" was voted in at number 15 in the 2005 Triple J Hottest 100 songs. Blasko later said, \"It's still probably the most asked-for song at my shows, much to my annoyance because of course everyone wants to be known for their own music. But it's a testament to its resonance and place in Australian culture.\"\n\nThe song was featured in a documentary on the \"Choir of Hard Knocks\", a Melbourne choir comprising a group of homeless people. It was also performed by The Whitlams' Tim Freedman on an episode of The Panel. Jimmy Barnes recorded an acoustic version of the track on his 1993 album Flesh and Wood.\n\nThe song was also covered by The Killjoys in 1994 on a compilation CD titled Earth Music, which featured many prominent artists covering well known songs.\n\nJessica Mauboy covered the song on her 2016 album, The Secret Daughter: Songs from the Original TV Series.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nExcerpt from documentary \"Choir of Hard Knocks\"\n\n1984 songs\n2006 singles\nCold Chisel songs\n1984 singles\nSongs written by Don Walker (musician)\nSongs written by Steve Prestwich"}

It was one of the first songs produced by Tony Visconti.\n\nInspiration \nIn July 1969, Bowie performed at the Maltese Music Festival while his father became sick and later died. The feel of the song was meant to show Bowie's feelings after his father's death.\n\nThe song also seems to be about social structure, as the girl in the song is very wealthy compared to the narrator. Bowie said that the song was written because he got \"funny stares\" from people.\n\nSong structure \nThe song opens with acoustic Asus2 and D9 chords. This repeats until the song enters the main structure, a new beat with guitars and harmonica. This part of the song mainly switches between C and F, but occasionally uses other chords as well. After the lyrics finish, the music continues for about two minutes before ending.\n\nReview after \"Blackstar\" \nAfter the release of \"Blackstar\" and the death of David Bowie, several lists were created that cited \"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\" as an important song in Bowie's history. Rolling Stone says that the song is \"pretty unremarkable except for one thing: It's the first Tony Visconti-produced David Bowie track the world ever heard.\" Hillary E. Crawford shares this opinion, only including it because \"This track, which immediately follows \"Space Oddity,\" was the first to be produced by Tony Visconti, the man who also produced Bowie's last album Blackstar.\"\n\nPersonnel \nAccording to Chris O'Leary:\n\nDavid Bowie – lead vocal\nKeith Christmas – 12-string acoustic guitar\nMick Wayne – lead guitar\nTim Renwick – rhythm guitar\nJohn Lodge – bass\nJohn Cambridge – drums\nBenny Marshall – harmonica\nUnknown musicians – saxophones, trumpets\nTony Visconti – producer\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n\nDavid Bowie songs\n1969 songs\nSongs written by David Bowie"}

The orthogonal transformations in the space are those automorphisms which preserve the value of the bilinear form between every pair of vectors; in Euclidean space, this corresponds to preserving distances and angles. These orthogonal transformations form a group under composition, called the orthogonal group.\n\nFor example, in the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, every orthogonal transformation is either a reflection across a line through the origin or a rotation about the origin (which can be written as the composition of two reflections). Any arbitrary composition of such rotations and reflections can be rewritten as a composition of no more than 2 reflections. Similarly, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, every orthogonal transformation can be described as a single reflection, a rotation (2 reflections), or an improper rotation (3 reflections). In four dimensions, double rotations are added that represent 4 reflections.\n\nFormal statement \nLet  be an n-dimensional, non-degenerate symmetric bilinear space over a field with characteristic not equal to 2. Then, every element of the orthogonal group  is a composition of at most n reflections.\n\nSee also\n Indefinite orthogonal group\n Coordinate rotations and reflections\n Householder reflections\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n\nTheorems in group theory\nBilinear forms"}

Its goal was \"for society to return to a healthy and blooming, strong and beautiful life\" as Ploetz put it. The Nordic race was supposed to regain its \"purity\" through selective reproduction and sterilization. The society became defunct after World War II.\n\nHistory\nSoon after the society was founded, it received generous support by the German imperial government and it was not the only organization of its kind in the world. Many organizations existed post WW1 with similar goals. Notable members comprised Ploetz' brother-in-law Ernst Rüdin and his childhood friend Gerhart Hauptmann, Wilhelm Bölsche, Max von Gruber, Agnes Bluhm, Wilhelm Filchner, Anastasius Nordenholz, and Ludwig Hermann Plate. The biologists Ernst Haeckel and August Weismann, as well as the gynecologist Ernst Ludwig Alfred Hegar, became honorary members. \n\nSince Ploetz wanted to establish an international movement, the society was soon renamed International Society for Racial Hygiene with branches in Berlin including Erwin Baur, in Munich, in Freiburg with the well-known human geneticists Fritz Lenz and Eugen Fischer and from 1910 in Stuttgart, which included the geneticist Wilhelm Weinberg. The organization was affiliated with the British Eugenics Education Society under Francis Galton; branches in Sweden, the United States, and the Netherlands were also established in the early 20th century. In 1924, the organization was named back to German Society for Racial Hygiene.\n\nThe ideas represented by the society became increasingly popular after the International Hygiene Exhibition of 1911. The organization wanted to establish \"racial hygiene\" as a scientific subject and contributed substantially to their implementation in Germany. With both adoption of the ideas of Nazi eugenics and with concrete consultations on political racial measures, the society took direct influence on statutes like the \"Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring\", which were an integral part of the Action T4 \"euthanasia\" programme of the Nazi regime led by Adolf Hitler. By 1933, the Society for Racial Hygiene had 1,300 members, many of them academics, as well as high functionaries in the Nazi Party.\n\nReferences\n\n Wolf, Caroline Wissenschaftler wider besseres Wissen in amatom Nr. 18.\n\n1905 establishments in Germany\nNazi eugenics\nEugenics organizations\nOrganizations established in 1905"}

The community is located at the crossroads of Lizard Lick Road and NC 97. Lizard Lick has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.\n\nThe community is approximately  east of the state capital of Raleigh, along NC 97. It is about  north of Wendell and  west of Zebulon.\n\nHistory\nAccording to NC historian William S. Powell, the town got its name from a \"passing observer who saw many lizards sunning and licking themselves on a rail fence.\"  Regardless of the town name, local community members who are native to the area are proud of their origins, and their economic future in the area.  In May 1997, the state installed the first traffic light in Lizard Lick, marking a new period of \"increasing property values\" and growth.\n\nMedia attention\nIn March 1998 the small town received publicity when Nintendo first released the Nintendo 64 game, \"Yoshi's Story\" there, with the name of the host town reflecting the Nintendo character Yoshi's ability to extend his tongue over a long distance. The pre-launch choice of Lizard Lick was the idea of Pasadena, California-based PR consultant Dereck Andrade. Andrade had been retained by the public relations firm Golin-Harris in Los Angeles to launch Yoshi's Story. Andrade chose two cities - French Lick, Indiana and Lizard Lick, as possible launch sites for the game. Lizard Lick was finally chosen over French Lick because the character of Yoshi was a dinosaur, which was related to a lizard. The game's launch in Lizard Lick was the largest event ever covered by the news media for a Nintendo product, bringing national and international news media to the crossroads town, including ABC World News Tonight, the CBS Evening News and NBC's The Today Show.\n\nIn September 2009 Lizard Lick once again received publicity, this time on a national level. The Time Warner owned TruTV cable television network became aware of a local towing and recovery company owned and operated by evangelist and Lizard Lick honorary \"Mayor\" Ronnie Shirley and his wife Amy called Lizard Lick Towing and Recovery.\n\nAccording to the Eastern Wake News, the television series, originally title Lizard Lick Towing and later titled Lick Life, got its start at the end of August 2008, when the station sent a cameraman down for one day of shooting and that was all it took for a contract to be written. Those at the network were merely scouting out prospects at the time, but after realizing Amy Shirley was not only a power lifter, but a mortician and co-owner of the recovery business, they realized there was more color to the picture than originally anticipated.\n\nIn addition, they soon discovered that Ronnie is a \"walking reality show\". Robyn Hutt, the truTV executive in charge of the show was quoted by the News & Observer (the largest regional daily newspaper of the Research Triangle Park area, covering several counties in North Carolina) \"We really fell in love with Lizard Lick\". The Shirleys are \"dynamic and entertaining characters\".\n\nThe television series (Lizard Lick Towing) following Ronnie and his company operations was called All Worked Up and had a discussion forum, Ronnie's published poetry, interviews with the stars of the show and further information, including the scheduled show times. The Shirleys now have their own show called Lizard Lick Towing. It is a half-hour program that is shown on the TruTV network. The show premiered on February 7, 2011. It is dedicated entirely to Lizard Lick Towing and Recovery, due to its fast growing popularity from the segments of the show All Worked Up.\n\nReferences\n\nUnincorporated communities in North Carolina\nUnincorporated communities in Wake County, North Carolina"}

Ok22 locomotives were the first on the PKP to be equipped with electric lights.\n\nWartime\nAfter the German invasion of Poland in World War II, most Ok22 locomotives were taken into the Deutsche Reichsbahn fleet as 38 4501 to 38 4630.\n\nPresent day\nOnly two examples have survived. Ok22-23 in Jaworzyna Śląska and Ok22-31 in Wolsztyn. Ok22-31 was an operational engine. It ran until 1997, and after retirement became a stationary exhibit. In 2004 the machine was restored to working order again, and it ran until 2009.

{"id": "4048247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistley", "title": "Mistley", "text": "Mistley is a village and civil parish in the Tendring district of northeast Essex, England. It is around 11 miles northeast of Colchester and is east of, and almost contiguous with, Manningtree. The parish consists of Mistley and New Mistley, both lying beside the Stour Estuary, and Mistley Heath, a kilometre to the south. Mistley railway station serves Mistley on the Mayflower line.\n\nMistley is the location of one of five Cold War control rooms in Essex. Built in 1951, it was opened as a museum called the Secret Bunker in 1996 but closed in 2002.\n\nHistory\nA Roman road leading from Mistley to the nearby provincial capital of Roman Britain at Camulodunum (modern Colchester) has led to the suggestion that there may have been a port in the vicinity of the modern village which served the town in the Roman period.\n\nMistley is the village where Matthew Hopkins, the Witchfinder General, was reputed to have lived, according to legend owning the Thorn Inn. He was buried a few hours after his death in the graveyard of the Church of St Mary. From 1920 to 1922, the Reverend Frank Buttle was rector of Mistley with Bradfield.\n\nSport\nThe village is home to Mistley Cricket Club, which plays its home games in New Road, next to the church. Both Mistley Football and Rugby clubs play at Furze Hill.\n\nMistley Quay\n\nThe first quay was built around 1720, and trade went on from that quay up to Sudbury. Around 1770, the quay was enlarged by Richard Rigby and was known as Port of Mistley. Small-scale shipbuilding took place here, and a number of smaller warships were built for the Royal Navy at Mistleythorn during the 18th century.\n\nAt that time, the village of Mistley, then known as Mistleythorn, consisted of warehouses, a granary, a large malting office and new quays. There was also a medieval church, only the porch of which survives, and a new church that Rigby's father had built to the north of the village in 1735. When Rigby hatched a scheme to turn Mistley into a fashionable spa this plain, rectangular brick building was not in keeping with his grand plans. Rigby originally called in Robert Adam to design a saltwater bath by the river, but this plan was never carried out and instead the architect was put to work on the church in around 1776.\n\nAdam's scheme was unusual in that it avoided the standard form of 18th-century parish church design, which consisted typically of a rectangle with a western tower or portico (or both) and perhaps an eastern chancel. Instead, by adding towers at the east and west ends and semi-circular porticoes on the north and south sides, Adam created a design that was symmetrical along both the long and short axes. This unusual arrangement was possibly influenced by the design of Roman tombs and the result was most unconventional. Mistley would certainly have stood out from other 18th-century churches.\n\nSadly for Rigby, his grand plans for the spa were unsuccessful. The main body of the church was demolished in 1870 when a new and larger church in the then fashionable Gothic Revival style was built nearby.\n\nWhen the young French aristocrat Francois de La Rochefoucauld visited Mistley in 1784, he remarked on the trade of the port which he said was 'created entirely by Mr Rigby'. His tutor and companion, Maximilien de Lazowski, was more precise in his comments, saying that 'Newcastle ships bring coal which is either distributed by cart into Essex or Suffolk or carried on upriver by barge to Sudbury. The whole neighbourhood brings its corn here to be embarked or stored for the London markets and all the coastal ports. There are six ships at the quay – a fine sight.',\n\nRecent history\n\nIn September 2008, at the behest of the Health and Safety Executive, owners Trent Wharfage erected a safety fence along the quay. A protest group was formed to object to the fence, claiming that it ended 500 years of free access to the water. After locals raised £35,000 to pay for legal advice, a public enquiry was held, and Essex County Council ruled that the quay constituted a \"village green\". Locals hope this paves the way to the removal of the fence, on the grounds that it interferes with the public's enjoyment of the public space. , the decision was under appeal. In February 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the registration of the land as a village green.\n\nThorn Quay Warehouse, the main building of which dates from the 1950s, is the subject of a debate regarding its demolition. , a High Court judge sided with the council, meaning that the planning permission for the demolition stood, and new homes could be built on the site.\n\nNotable people \nThe film director Terence Davies (1945–2023) lived in the village.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nVillages in Essex\nCivil parishes in Essex\nTendring"}

{"id": "4048317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing%20%28Australian%20politics%29", "title": "Swing (Australian politics)", "text": "The term swing refers to the extent of change in voter support, typically from one election or opinion poll to another, expressed as a positive or negative percentage point. For the Australian House of Representatives and the lower houses of the parliaments of all the states and territories except Tasmania and the ACT, Australia employs preferential voting in single-member constituencies. Under the full-preference instant-runoff voting system, in each seat the candidate with the lowest vote is eliminated and their preferences are distributed, which is repeated until only two candidates remain. While every seat has a two-candidate preferred (TCP) result, seats where the major parties have come first and second are commonly referred to as having a two-party-preferred (TPP) result. The concept of \"swing\" in Australian elections is not simply a function of the difference between the votes of the two leading candidates, as it is in Britain. To know the majority of any seat, and therefore the swing necessary for it to change hands, it is necessary to know the preferences of all the voters, regardless of their first preference votes. It is not uncommon in Australia for candidates who have comfortable leads on the first count to fail to win the seat, because \"preference flows\" go against them.\n\nTPP/TCP swings\nIn seats where the major parties do not come first and second, differing TPP and TCP results are returned. Whilst each seat that preferences down to two major party candidates has the same TPP as TCP, in seats not contested by a major party, such as at some by-elections or some seats in some state elections, only a TCP vote can be produced. At federal elections, it is possible to calculate a TPP/TCP majority for every seat. The swing is therefore what is required for that seat to change hands at the next election.\n\nSwings in Australian parliaments are more commonly associated with the TPP vote. While seats are normally referred to on TPP terms, when one of the remaining two candidates after preference distribution are not from a major party, it is referred to as a TCP, with a different TPP produced. In a TCP contest between Labor and the Nationals and without a Liberal candidate, this is also considered a TPP, with the Nationals considered a de facto major party within the Liberal–National Coalition. At the 2013 federal election, only 11 of 150 seats returned differing TPP and TCP figures (\"non-classic seats\"), indicating a considerable two-party system.\n\nThe Mackerras pendulum takes the TPP majorities of all electorates and arranges them in order, from the seat with the highest government majority to the seat with the highest opposition majority. For example, ahead of the 2007 election, Labor needed to win a minimum of 16 additional seats to form a government, and the 16th-weakest government seat (McMillan) had a TPP majority of 4.9 points. Thus, the pendulum predicted that Labor would need a uniform TPP swing of 4.9 points to win the 2007 election. Labor in fact gained a swing of 5.6 points, which the pendulum had predicted would result in 21 additional Labor seats under a uniform swing. In fact, Labor gained 23 seats, and not all seats that changed hands were those with the slimmest Coalition majorities, because swings in each district are unique and not uniform.\n\nExamples\n\nFederal, Adelaide 2004 \n\nIt can be seen that the Liberal candidate had a primary vote lead over the Labor candidate. In first-past-the-post voting, the Liberals would have retained the seat, and their majority would be said to be 3.4 percentage points (45.3 − 41.9).\n\nHowever, under full-preference instant-runoff voting, the votes of all the minor candidates were distributed as follows:\n\nThus, Labor defeated the Liberals, with 85 percent of Green and Green-preferenced voters preferencing Labor on the last distribution. Labor's TPP/TCP vote was 51.3 percent, a TPP/TCP majority of 1.3 points, and a TPP/TCP swing of 1.9 points compared with the previous election.\n\nSouth Australia, Frome 2009\n\nThe 2009 Frome by-election was closely contested, with the result being uncertain for over a week. Liberal leader Martin Hamilton-Smith claimed victory on behalf of the party. The result hinged on the performance of Brock against Labor in the competition for second place. Brock polled best in the Port Pirie area, and received enough eliminated candidate preferences to end up ahead of the Labor candidate by 30 votes.\n\nBrock received 80 percent of Labor's fifth-count preferences to achieve a TCP vote of 51.72 percent (a majority of 665 votes) against the Liberal candidate. The by-election saw a rare TPP swing to an incumbent government, and was the first time an opposition had lost a seat at a by-election in South Australia. The result in Frome at the 2010 state election saw Brock come first on primary votes, increasing his primary vote by 14.1 points to a total of 37.7 percent and his TCP vote by 6.5 points to a total of 58.2 percent. Despite a statewide swing against Labor at the election, Labor again increased its TPP vote in Frome by 1.8 points up to 49.9%.\n\nFederal, Melbourne 2010\n\nIn this example, the two remaining candidates/parties, one a minor party, were the same after preference distribution at both this election and the previous election. Therefore, differing TPP and TCP votes, margins, and swings resulted.\n\nSouth Australia, Port Adelaide 2012\n\nAt the 2012 Port Adelaide state by-election, only a TCP could be produced, as the Liberal Party of Australia (and Family First Party and independent candidate Max James), who contested the previous election and gained a primary vote of 26.8 percent (and 5.9 percent, and 11.0 percent respectively), did not contest the by-election. On a TPP margin of 12.8 percent from the 2010 election, considered a safe margin on the current pendulum, Labor would have likely retained their TPP margin based on unchanged statewide Newspoll since the previous election. Labor retained the seat on a 52.9 percent TCP against Johanson after the distribution of preferences. Unlike previous examples, neither a TPP or TCP swing can be produced, as the 2010 result was between Labor and Liberal rather than Labor and independent with no Liberal candidate. An increase or decrease in margins in these situations cannot be meaningfully interpreted as swings. As explained by the ABC's Antony Green, when a major party does not contest a by-election, preferences from independents or minor parties that would normally flow to both major parties does not take place, causing asymmetric preference flows. Examples of this are the 2008 Mayo and 2002 Cunningham federal by-elections, with seats returning to TPP form at the next election.\n\nReferences\n\nElections in Australia\nPsephology"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1995 to 2001 for the Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He is currently the pitching coach for the GCL Mets.\n\nCareer\nPrieto played baseball both for Fajardo University, located in Santiago de Cuba, and for Piratas de Isla de la Juventud in the Cuban National Series, a winter baseball league in Cuba. Concerned that he would be unable to leave Cuba if he was highly valued as an athlete, Prieto intentionally pitched poorly during the winter of 1994. Prieto and his wife were granted visas to travel outside of Cuba in April 1995, and they relocated to Florida.\n\nPrieto was selected  fifth overall in the 1995 MLB draft by the Oakland Athletics. He made his major-league debut for the Athletics that July. Prieto, being unfamiliar with American banks and credit cards, walked around with his $1.2 million signing-bonus check in his pocket for over a week. He won two games and lost six, becoming one of the few players to be drafted and then play in MLB during the same season. In 1996, Prieto had what was arguably his best season, winning 6 games and losing 7 with an earned run average (ERA) of 4.15.\n\nPrieto was traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before the 2001 season. With the Devil Rays, Prieto saw action in three games, without any decisions, allowing one earned run in  innings pitched. His one season with the Devil Rays was his last season in the major leagues. Prieto played in Mexico during the middle 2000s, playing with the Venados de Mazatlán, a team that he also played for in the Caribbean World Series, held that year in Venezuela. During six MLB seasons, Prieto won 15 games and lost 24, with an overall 4.85 ERA.\n\nPrieto played professionally until 2005 in Minor League Baseball, without returning to MLB.\n\nCoaching career\nPrieto spent the 2009 through 2011 seasons as the pitching coach for the Athletics' Arizona League team.\n\nOn November 10, 2011, Prieto was announced as the pitching coach for the Vermont Lake Monsters, the Athletics' New York–Penn League (Single A, short season) team.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2015, Prieto served as interpreter for fellow Cuban defector, New York Mets outfielder  Yoenis Céspedes.\n\nIn 2015, Prieto was hired as a coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was let go in 2017.\n\nPrieto was named as the pitching coach for the GCL Mets of the New York Mets organization for the 2018 season.\n\nSee also\n\nList of baseball players who defected from Cuba\nList of baseball players who went directly to Major League Baseball\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1969 births\nLiving people\nOakland Athletics players\nTampa Bay Devil Rays players\nOakland Athletics coaches\nMajor League Baseball players from Cuba\nCuban expatriate baseball players in the United States\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nArizona Diamondbacks coaches\nPalm Springs Suns players\nEdmonton Trappers players\nModesto A's players\nSacramento River Cats players\nDurham Bulls players\nNashville Sounds players\nToledo Mud Hens players\nAlbuquerque Isotopes players\nYaquis de Obregón players\nCuban expatriate baseball players in Mexico\nCaribes de Oriente players\nDefecting Cuban baseball players\nCuban expatriate baseball players in Venezuela\nCuban expatriate baseball players in Canada\nBaseball players from Havana"}

{"id": "4048451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal%20College%20of%20General%20Practitioners", "title": "Royal College of General Practitioners", "text": "The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) is the professional body for general (medical) practitioners (GPs/Family Physicians/Primary Care Physicians) in the United Kingdom. The RCGP represents and supports GPs on key issues including licensing, education, training, research and clinical standards. It is the largest of the medical royal colleges, with over 50,000 members. The RCGP was founded in 1952 in London, England and is a registered charity. Its motto is Cum Scientia Caritas – \"Compassion [empowered] with Knowledge.\"\n\nOrganisation\nThe RCGP is unique amongst the medical royal colleges in having both a President and a Chairman. The President takes a mainly ceremonial function while the Chairman sets the college's policy direction, and leads the RCGP decision making body – the council. In 2012 the establishment of a new Trustee Board meant that members of the council were relieved of having to act in a statutory capacity relating to the college's charity status.\n\nThe council of the RCGP encompasses 32 groups ('Faculties') located across the UK, the Republic of Ireland and overseas. These are semi-autonomous units that provide local support and services for doctors, including educational events, training and personal development services. The college also incorporates devolved councils in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that liaise with their own national health and primary care organisations.\n\n, the President is Dame Clare Gerada, Chair of Council is Dr Kamila Hawthorne MBE, Honorary Secretary is Michael Mulholland, Honorary Treasurer is Steve Mowle, Vice Chair Professional Development is Margaret Ikpoh and Vice Chair External Affairs is Gary Howsam.\n\nMembership\n\nPaid membership of the RCGP is split into three main groups:\n Associates – fully or provisionally registered medical practitioners who have yet to pass college assessments for membership.\n Members – medical practitioners who have successfully completed the College's assessments and applied for membership.\n Fellows – an honour and mark of achievement awarded to members who have made a significant contribution to the health and welfare of the community, to the science or practice of medicine in general, or to general practice/primary care in particular.\n\nRCGP membership is also extended to Associates in Training (doctors in specialty training for general practice) and Life Members.  the membership total stands at over 50,000. Members of the RCGP are required to abide by the RCGP constitution.\n\nThe college gained over 7,000 Associates in Training (AiTs) in 2008, when membership was made compulsory for GP trainees. The membership total has effectively doubled between 1998 and 2008.\n\nMRCGP postgraduate qualification\nMembership of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) is a postgraduate medical qualification in the UK. The MRCGP Qualification is an integrated training and assessment system run by the RCGP. It aims to demonstrate excellence in the provision of General Practice. While the MRCGP was originally an optional qualification, it has more recently become mandatory for newly qualifying GPs and is directly linked to the GP Curriculum which the RCGP published in 2007 and regularly updates as necessary.\n\nThe award of MRCGP in addition to meeting all the criteria of the GMC along with a payment of a fee (currently £500) may lead to the award of a Certificate of Completion of Training.\n\nIn 2007 a new system of assessment was introduced, delivered locally in conjunction with deaneries, with the qualification awarded on completion of a three-year specialty training programme. Doctors with a licence to practise who successfully complete the MRCGP are eligible for inclusion on the General Medical Council's (GMC) GP Register as well use of the post nominals that indicate membership of the RCGP (MRCGP). Immediately after the introduction of the 2007 changes the term \"nMRCGP\" had helped to differentiate between old and new assessment procedures (with n meaning new). After several years, once all trainees were being assessed using the new methods, the \"n\" was dropped.\n\nTraining and assessment comprises three components, which cover the general practice specialty training curriculum.\n\n The Applied Knowledge Test (AKT) is a multiple-choice computer-based assessment that tests the knowledge base underpinning general practice in the UK.  It covers clinical medicine, critical appraisal/evidence-based clinical practice and health informatics/administrative issues.\n The Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) assesses a doctor's ability to integrate and apply clinical, professional, communication and practical skills to general practice. It simulates patient consultations based on scenarios drawn from general practice. Each consultation is marked by a different assessor, and the role of the patient is taken by a trained role-player.\n The Workplace-Based Assessment (WPBA)  evaluates a doctor's performance over time in the twelve professional competence areas that make up \"Being a General Practitioner\". This assessment takes place in the workplace throughout a GP's training.\n\nMembership by Assessment of Performance (MAP) is the alternative route to membership. It enables established GPs, who cannot take the college's MRCGP exam, to gain membership through submission of a portfolio of evidence and potentially an oral examination. This route to membership is open to all established GPs who are registered to practice in the UK and who never took College exams.\n\nRacial discrimination in clinical skills assessment\nIn 2013 the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin launched a legal challenge to the regulator, the General Medical Council, and the college alleging that the clinical skills assessment component of the Membership exam was discriminatory and seeking a judicial review of the way the RCGP conducted the test, because there is a \"significant difference in pass rates which cannot be explained by a lack of any knowledge, skill or competency on the part of the International Medical Graduates. 65.3% of international graduates failed their first attempt at the Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) component of the MRCGP exam in 2011/12, compared with 9.9% of UK graduates. In 2010/11, 59.2% of the international graduates failed at the first attempt, compared with 8.2% of UK graduates, while in 2008, 43% of IMGs failed the CSA compared with 8.3% of UK graduates.\n\nAneez Esmail was asked to analyse data on more than 5,000 candidates who sat the CSA exam over a two-year period by the GMC. He found that ‘subjective bias due to racial discrimination may be a cause’ of the different pass rates for between white and non-white graduates.\n\nThe Judicial Review failed. Mr Justice John Mitting presiding over the case said that the Royal College of General Practitioners was neither racially discriminatory nor in breach of its public sector equality duty. He said the college had carried out numerous assessments that identified the disparity in performance between different groups and that it should now take action, including by selecting more representative examiners and role-players for the assessment.\n\nSubsequently, the college, BAPIO announced that they would be working in close collaboration to address supporting international medical graduates and Black and Minority Ethnic doctors in relation to training and passing the MRCGP.\n\nProfessional development\nThe RCGP runs a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) Credits scheme that offers GPs a flexible learning framework in which to produce a portfolio of work that supports the Revalidation process. Key elements of the college's work in this field include developing a quality assured appraisal system and an ePortfolio that logs evidence of GPs' learning.\n\nThe CPD scheme is supported by the Online Learning Environment and Essential Knowledge Updates (EKU), providing doctors with  e-learning tools, publications and other written materials on the latest developments in clinical practice knowledge. The provision of educational support for members includes:\n E-learning modules\n British Journal of General Practice\n InnovAiT\n Essential Knowledge Updates and Challenge\n Personal Education Programme (PEP)\n Clinical courses\n Clinical updates\n CPD Credits Scheme.\n\nThis has led to improved retention, which now exceeds 97%, and is 7% higher than the average retention rate for UK-based membership organisations charging a similar annual membership subscription fee. The RCGP has also developed Quality Programmes to support GPs and their teams. These are criteria and evidence based programmes which are designed to be voluntary, supportive and developmental in function.\n\nCourses and events\nThe RCGP runs an Annual Conference each autumn, often attracting political, national and international speakers. The RCGP also hold a variety of courses and conferences throughout the year on specific clinical topics (e.g. Certificate in the treatment of substance misuse; Minor Surgery; Commissioning of local care; and regular 'one-day essentials' such as obesity, respiratory care and dementia) – all aimed at GPs and other health professionals within primary care.\n\nInternational work\nThe RCGP  builds partnerships with overseas health organisations, runs an International Development Programme and develops postgraduate assessment through an International Membership accreditation scheme called MRCGP[INT].\n\nThe college advises international doctors wishing to study or practise in the UK, and runs an International Travel Scholarship to support the study needs of members and non-members.\n\nPublications, information services and archives\n\nThe RCGP publishes\n The British Journal of General Practice (BJGP) is an international journal publishing research, debate and analysis, and clinical guidance for family practitioners and primary care researchers worldwide, formerly known as The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners\n RCGP News, the college's monthly newspaper, covering events in both the college and the wider medical professions\n Free electronic bulletins, including the weekly Seven days and bi-monthly e-Bulletin\n InnovAiT\n\nThe college also produces several key documents, reports, position statements and occasionally guidance in a variety of areas each year. The college's Clinical Champions working out of its Clinical Innovation and Research Centre also produce a wide range of materials in response to identified clinical priorities, including:\n Medical Generalism: Why expertise in whole person medicine matters\n General Practice 2022 (in progress)- detailing how general practice can be the driving force for transforming the health service over the next decade\n Personal health budgets (Guide for GPs and position statement)\n Social Media Highway Code (for discussion)\n Whistle Blowing in the NHS (position statement)\n\nThe RCGP's library catalogue contains MD and PhD theses on general practice, an international selection of primary care journals and a loan collection of college publications. The library is open to all members, and to non-members by appointment.\n\nRCGP's archives provide an important insight into the origins of the college and the foundation of modern general practice. Exhibits include a variety of personal papers, historic books, college institutional records, and a museum collection of medical instruments dating back to the 17th century.\n\nPrizes and awards\nThe RCGP provides over 20 academic and monetary awards for people at different stages of their career. The awards are administered by an Awards Committee chaired by the President, and are usually presented at the college's two general meetings. The college also offers a number of International Travel Scholarships, and some regional faculties run their own awards. The college's highest award is the Honorary Fellowship, awarded to doctors and non-doctors from the UK and overseas for outstanding work towards the objectives of the college.\n\nCollege history and headquarters\n\nCo-founders of the college include Fraser Rose, John Hunt and George Abercrombie and others who joined the steering committee in 1951. The college began in November 1952 in response to growing physical, administrative and financial pressures that demoralised GPs and undermined standards of patient care. GPs now had to provide free primary care throughout the community and act as 'gatekeepers' with responsibility for referring patients to specialist consultants in NHS hospitals.\n\nThe formation of the college received widespread support throughout the medical press and individual GPs. In January 1953 'Foundation Membership' was made available to established GPs who satisfied defined criteria, and within six weeks 1,655 doctors had joined. One of the first presidents of the RCGP was William Pickles. He spoke out in favour of the foundation of the NHS and was held in high regard worldwide for his work in epidemiology.\n\nThe college's coat of arms and inscription Cum Scientia Caritas were designed by Perry Harrison, a founder member of the college. The college received the letters patent for its Arms in 1961. The elements represent historical context and themes relevant to general medical practice:\n The ancient lineage of medicine – the gavel entwined with the serpent of Asclepius (the Greek God of Medicine).\n The owl of the crest represents wisdom, and night visits; the gavel, authority and decision-making.\n The shield itself is derived from that of St Bartholomew's Hospital (the oldest extant hospital site in the UK). Its chevron in these arms represents a roof (of the house in which general practice takes place), and day and night (black/white) alluding to the 24-hour commitment of GPs to their patients.\n The lamp represents enlightenment, the importance of study/research, and links with the lamp of nursing.\n The doctor's compassionate and healing relationship with their patient is represented by the white poppy (symbolising the relief of pain) and the blue gentian (representing the restorative and rehabilitative role of the GP).\n The supporters are a unicorn (from the arms of the Society of Apothecaries, the forerunners of General Practitioners in the UK and in whose Hall the College of General Practitioners was first housed, but also representing medicine), and a lynx (from the Arms of the Company of Barbers and subsequently the Royal College of Surgeons, representing surgery). The spots on the lynx indicate its all-seeing nature, which is thought appropriate for general practice.\n The motto is Cum Scientia Caritas (Compassion [empowered] with Knowledge).\n\nFrom 1962 the headquarters of the college were at 14 Princes Gate, Kensington, London. By 1970 the college had 7,500 members.\n\nIn late October 2012 the college moved into new headquarters at 30 Euston Square, Camden, London. The building includes a Clinical Skills Assessment Centre (CSA) which means that the college has the capacity to assess several hundred candidates during sittings that are held throughout the year. Concern has been expressed about the effect on the headquarters when re-development of Euston Station takes place to accommodate the new High Speed Two development.\n\nCriticism\n\nThe RCGP has been criticised for its support of the fossil fuel industry by hosting the 2020 Oil and Gas UK Exploration Conference at its London headquarters. This was cancelled after a petition by members raised concerns.\n\nSee also\n Medical school in the United Kingdom\n List of medical schools in the United Kingdom\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nGeneral practice organizations\nMedical associations based in the United Kingdom\nOrganisations based in the London Borough of Camden\nOrganisations based in London with royal patronage\nOrganizations established in 1952\nGeneral Practitioners\n1952 establishments in the United Kingdom"}
{"id": "4048455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanically%20interlocked%20molecular%20architectures", "title": "Mechanically interlocked molecular architectures", "text": "In chemistry, mechanically interlocked molecular architectures (MIMAs) are molecules that are connected as a consequence of their topology. This connection of molecules is analogous to keys on a keychain loop. The keys are not directly connected to the keychain loop but they cannot be separated without breaking the loop. On the molecular level, the interlocked molecules cannot be separated without the breaking of the covalent bonds that comprise the conjoined molecules; this is referred to as a mechanical bond. Examples of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures include catenanes, rotaxanes, molecular knots, and molecular Borromean rings. Work in this area was recognized with the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Bernard L. Feringa, Jean-Pierre Sauvage, and J. Fraser Stoddart.\n\nThe synthesis of such entangled architectures has been made efficient by combining supramolecular chemistry with traditional covalent synthesis, however mechanically interlocked molecular architectures have properties that differ from both \"supramolecular assemblies\" and \"covalently bonded molecules\". The terminology \"mechanical bond\" has been coined to describe the connection between the components of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures. Although research into mechanically interlocked molecular architectures is primarily focused on artificial compounds, many examples have been found in biological systems including: cystine knots, cyclotides or lasso-peptides such as microcin J25 which are proteins, and a variety of peptides.\n\nResidual topology\nResidual topology  is a descriptive stereochemical term to classify a number of intertwined and interlocked molecules, which cannot be disentangled in an experiment without breaking of covalent bonds, while the strict rules of mathematical topology allow such a disentanglement. Examples of such molecules are rotaxanes, catenanes with covalently linked rings (so-called pretzelanes), and open knots (pseudoknots) which are abundant in proteins.\n\nThe term \"residual topology\" was suggested on account of a striking similarity of these compounds to the well-established topologically nontrivial species, such as catenanes and knotanes (molecular knots). The idea of residual topological isomerism introduces a handy scheme of modifying the molecular graphs and generalizes former efforts of systemization of mechanically bound and bridged molecules.\n\nHistory \nExperimentally the first examples of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures appeared in the 1960s with catenanes being synthesized by Wasserman and Schill and rotaxanes by Harrison and Harrison. The chemistry of MIMAs came of age when Sauvage pioneered their synthesis using templating methods. In the early 1990s the usefulness and even the existence of MIMAs were challenged. The latter concern was addressed by X ray crystallographer and structural chemist David Williams. Two postdoctoral researchers who took on the challenge of producing [5]catenane (olympiadane) pushed the boundaries of the complexity of MIMAs that could be synthesized their success was confirmed in 1996 by a solid‐state structure analysis conducted by David Williams.\n\nMechanical bonding and chemical reactivity\nThe introduction of a mechanical bond alters the chemistry of the sub components of rotaxanes and catenanes. Steric hindrance of reactive functionalities is increased and the strength of non-covalent interactions between the components are altered.\n\nMechanical bonding effects on non-covalent interactions\nThe strength of non-covalent interactions in a mechanically interlocked molecular architecture increases as compared to the non-mechanically bonded analogues. This increased strength is demonstrated by the necessity of harsher conditions to remove a metal template ion from catenanes as opposed to their non-mechanically bonded analogues. This effect is referred to as the \"catenand effect\". This increase in strength of non-covalent interactions is attributed to the loss of degrees of freedom upon the formation of a mechanical bond. The increase in strength of non-covalent interactions is more pronounced on smaller interlocked systems, where more degrees of freedom are lost, as compared to larger mechanically interlocked systems where the change in degrees of freedom is lower. Therefore, if the ring in a rotaxane is made smaller the strength of non-covalent interactions increases, the same effect is observed if the thread is made smaller as well.\n\nMechanical bonding effects on chemical reactivity\nThe mechanical bond can reduce the kinetic reactivity of the products, this is ascribed to the increased steric hindrance. Because of this effect hydrogenation of an alkene on the thread of a rotaxane is significantly slower as compared to the equivalent non interlocked thread. This effect has allowed for the isolation of otherwise reactive intermediates.\n\nThe ability to alter reactivity without altering covalent structure has led to MIMAs being investigated for a number of technological applications.\n\nApplications of mechanical bonding in controlling chemical reactivity\nThe ability for a mechanical bond to reduce reactivity and hence prevent unwanted reactions has been exploited in a number of areas. One of the earliest applications was in the protection of organic dyes from environmental degradation.\n\nExamples\nOlympiadane\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nSupramolecular chemistry\nMolecular topology"}

{"id": "4048468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian%20Frei", "title": "Christian Frei", "text": "Christian Frei (born 1959 in Schönenwerd, Solothurn) is a Swiss filmmaker and film producer. He is mostly known for his films War Photographer (2001), The Giant Buddhas (2005) and Space Tourists (2009).\n\nFrei has been an associate lecturer on Reflection Competence at the renowned University of St. Gallen from 2006 to 2023. From 2006 to 2009 he was president of the “Documentary Film Commission” for the film section of the Swiss Federal Office of Culture, and from 2010 to 2022 he had held the position of President of the Swiss Film Academy.\n\nCareer\nFrom the very start of his career, Frei established a reputation as an exacting documentarist, with a . He follows his protagonists closely - always in search of authentic moments, and always keeping the whole picture in mind. Peter-Matthias Gaede said that Frei made films that avoided \"noise, pompous gestures, the rush of speed\" and that he and his cameraman (Peter Indergand) made films that were subtle and \"exude quiet persistance\". According to Kulturzeit, \"What makes these films so extraordinary? They are authentic moments that endure. Christian Frei takes us along a perimeter that both divides and unites individuals and cultures: the tectonics of humanity.\"\n\nFrei studied television at the Department of Journalism and Communications of the University of Fribourg. In 1981 he directed his first documentary short film, Die Stellvertreterin. After co-directing Fortfahren with Ivo Kummer in 1984, he became an independent filmmaker and producer. He made another short film, Der Radwechsel. Then he moved on to feature-length documentaries with Ricardo, Miriam y Fidel (1997). The documentary was described as being \"surprisingly revealing\" by the Chicago Tribune, who went on to say that the \"pain and disillusionment on both sides are in plain view\". It portrays the rift between Miriam Martinez, who wants to leave Cuba for the USA, and her father Ricardo Martinez - one of the founders of Fidel Castro's \"Radio Rebelde\". The Chicago Tribune goes on to say that the film \"is equally sympathetic to Ricardo's revolutionary hopes and Miriam's hopelessness -- an amazing feat in a Cuban film.\"\n\nWar Photographer (2001) marks a turning point in his career as director in 2001: Due to the Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary and numerous prizes worldwide he had the international break through. For this feature-length documentary, Frei spent two years accompanying war photographer James Nachtwey to different war zones around the world. The film shows his protagonist to be a shy and reserved man, far from the hothead image associated with his profession. Frei intelligently plays with the role of the spectator, confronting him with the ambivalence of war photography and the role of the media. The documentary appeals to the spectators’ sense for compassion and thematically approaches the theme of war itself.  Still popular with audiences and critics today, the film has become a classic.\n\nWith The Giant Buddhas (2005), Frei once again deals with a subject of strong political and global interest: The film revolves around the destruction of the two giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in Afghanistan’s remote Bamiyan Valley. It is an essay \"on faith and fanaticism, tolerance and terrorism, identity and ignorance, the ephemeral and our feeble attempts to preserve it\". The film turned out to be a documentary that filled a necessary gap of knowledge far from the everyday media war reportage.\n\nAt the Sundance Film Festival in 2010 Frei won the “World Cinema Directing Award” for his film Space Tourists (2009). The documentary juxtaposes the journeys of the extremely rich tourists traveling with the astronauts into space with the poor Kazakh metal collectors risking their lives in search for rocket waste fallen down into the planes once the space shuttle has left. As a result, the film turns out to be a humorous and poetic declaration of love for planet earth. Critics acclaimed this film for its breathtaking imagery and richness of insights, having strengthened Frei’s reputation as one of today’s most original and innovative directors.\n\nIn 2014, Sleepless in New York premiered in competition at Visions du Réel, the Nyon International Documentary Film Festival.

{"id": "4048476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%20albatross", "title": "Campbell albatross", "text": "The Campbell albatross (Thalassarche impavida) or Campbell mollymawk, is a medium-sized mollymawk in the albatross family.  It breeds only on Campbell Island and the associated islet of Jeanette Marie, in a small New Zealand island group in the South Pacific. It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the black-browed albatross. It is a medium-sized black and white albatross with a pale yellow iris.\n\nTaxonomy\nMollymawks are a type of albatross that belong to family Diomedeidae of the order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns, although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used against predators as well as an energy-rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland situated above the nasal passage which helps desalinate their bodies, necessary due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose.\n\nIn 1998, Robertson and Nunn suggested the species be split off of the black-browed albatross, Thalassarche melanophrys. Over the course of the next few years more experts agreed, starting with BirdLife International in 2000, followed by Brooke in 2004. James Clements did not agree, the ACAP has not agreed yet, and SACC recognizes the need for a proposal.\n\nDescription\nIt weighs  and is  long. The adult is very similar to the black-browed albatross, differing in eye color. It has a white head, neck, rump, and underparts, with a black upperwing, back, and tail. The underwing is white with broad black edging. It has a black triangle around the eye that reaches the bill, which is yellow with an orange tip. They also have a pale yellow iris. The juveniles have a brown-grey bill with a black tip, dark eyes and less black on the underwing. The average life expectancy is given as 28 years, though this is likely due to lack of study as most albatross can live to well beyond 50 years.\n\nRange and habitat\n\nThe Campbell albatross breeds on the northern and western coastline of Campbell Island and the islet Jeanette Marie, part of the Campbell Islands group, one of New Zealand's five subantarctic island groups. When breeding they forage from South Island and the Chatham Rise to the Ross Sea. Juveniles and non-breeders will go only through south Australian water, the Tasman Sea, and southwestern Pacific Ocean.\n\nBehavior\n\nFeeding\nThe Cambell albatross feeds on fish, squid, crustacea, carrion, and gelatinous organisms.\n\nReproduction\nBreeding birds like to nest on ledges and steep slopes covered with low grass, tussock, or mud. They start breeding at 10 years and they have a breeding success rate of 66%. Adults return to the breeding colony in early August and begin laying in late September. The single egg is incubated for around 70 days. The chicks fledge after about 130 days after hatching.\n\nConservation\nThe IUCN classifies this species as vulnerable due to the limited number of breeding locations. The most recent estimate was in 1997 and counted 24,600 pairs. Between 1992 and 1997 sampled colonies have been increasing at the rate of 1.8%. Adult survival rate is at 94.5%. It has an occurrence range of  and a breeding range of .\n\nThe largest threat to this species are fisheries, both longline and trawlers.\n\nThe feral sheep that existed on Campbell Island were fully eradicated by 1991, and rats and cats were eradicated by 2001. Finally, studies are ongoing.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \nMoore, P. J.

It is within the townland of Naghan, one mile (1.6 km) north of Clough on the main Ballynahinch to Newcastle road. It is part of the Newry, Mourne and Down area.\n\nHistory \n\nThe village is named after the Forde family, who descend from Nicholas Forde of Dunboyne County Meath, who held the post of Deputy Victualler in Cork in 1580, as supplier to Elizabeth I of England's army in Ireland. The village lands were purchased by Nicholas's fifth son, Mathew Forde (who later sat in the Irish House of Commons in 1642) as part of a wider acquisition of estate lands in Kinelarty in County Down, which he purchased from Thomas Cromwell, Viscount Lecale between the years 1615 and 1636. Mathew Forde, who also owned properties in Fishamble-street in Dublin, had already purchased estate lands in and around the village of Coolgreany in County Wexford in 1617.  Although Coolgreany was the principal seat of the Forde family during the 17th century, after the Battle of the Boyne Seaforde became the family's principal place of residence.\n\nSeaforde House\n\nMathew Forde (1675-1729) built the original mansion on the Seaforde demesne, which lies to the north of the village. It was rebuilt in 1819, after a destructive fire, by Mathew Forde, MP (1785-1837) to create the present house, a neo-classical building of seven bays and three storeys over a basement, the top storey being treated as an attic. There is a five-bay frontage faced in sandstone ashlar.\n\nThe estate was at one time the home of the Lecale Hunt, and later the East Down Hunt. Seaforde was the birthplace of Colonel Francis Forde (1718 to 1770), who fought and served with Clive of India. The Forde family still resides at Seaforde House.

During each shooting section, each biathlete fired five shots at five targets. Misses resulted in penalties of one minute per miss being added to the time for the course. The first and third shooting sections were conducted in the prone position, while the second and fourth were done standing. A total of 88 biathletes competed, starting with a staggered start and 30 seconds behind each competitor.\n\nMichael Greis of Germany hit 19 of the 20 targets and used a net time of 54:23.0 (with one penalty minute) to clinch the gold medal, 16 seconds ahead of Norway's Ole Einar Bjørndalen. Norway also won the bronze medal, with Halvard Hanevold beating Sergei Tchepikov by 0.8 seconds despite two penalty minutes to the Russian's one.\n\nThe previous year's trial World Cup event at this track saw Michael Greis of Germany win the event in a time of 53:18.7. At the 2005 World Championships in Hochfilzen, Austria, the Czech Roman Dostál won, while Ole Einar Bjørndalen was the defending Olympic champion, as he was in all the other men's events (except the mass start, which is held for the first time at the Olympics). However, neither Bjørndalen (9th) nor Dostal (33rd) headed the men's individual World Cup standings—the German Michael Greis did.\n\nThe event started with early starters Ricco Groß (Germany, started as number 4) and Pavel Rostovtsev (Russia, 1) shooting well, missing one and two of their 20 shots respectively; Groß suffered his missed shot on the last of the four shootings. However, their cross-country times were not good enough, as Rene Vuillermoz (Italy, 13) beat Groß by 14 seconds on the first loop. With only one miss in his first 15 shots, Vuillermoz could have taken the lead if he had hit all five targets on the final shooting. However, he missed three times and eventually finished 25th. Maxim Tchoudov (Russia, 14) led after two loops, 28 seconds ahead of Groß, but had spoiled his chance with three missed shots. By that time, many of the best skiers had started, with Greis (38) coming into the third shooting after one miss on the second. He hit five targets, and went out in the second best time, 12 seconds behind Marek Matiasko (Slovakia, 21), who was yet to miss a shot. Meanwhile, the defending champion Bjørndalen (54) had missed once on each of the first two shootings, and when all had passed the second loop he was 15th.\n\nHowever, Bjørndalen completed the third loop quickly, and with five hits he cut Greis' lead from 39 to 23 seconds just before Greis was to shoot his fourth shooting. Greis did not miss, and with the leader Matiasko conceding one penalty minute, Greis took the lead nearly a minute ahead of second-placed Julien Robert (France, 35), who had not missed a single shot. Some other late starters visited the top ten after the first loops, such as Sven Fischer (Germany, 63) and Zdeněk Vítek (Czech Republic, 67) but vanished, and there were only four others who could beat Greis' skiing speed. Except for Bjørndalen, all of the previous had started before him, but missed too many shots to compete; however, Bjørndalen had caught 37 seconds on the first 12 km, and needed a further 23. Thus, Bjørndalen was the only threat, and though Bjørndalen hit all five targets on the final shooting, he struggled with loading the rifle before the final shot. He later said he lost \"7-8 seconds\" on the error. Thus, Bjørndalen did not beat the German in the fourth loop, and though he cut a further seven seconds off Greis' time in the final loop, it was only enough to take the silver. The late starting Halvard Hanevold (Norway, 74), shot down the last 10 targets to jump from 28th place after two loops to a fourth place after the fourth, with third-placed Robert eight seconds ahead with two penalty minutes less. Hanevold had no problems with catching Robert on the final lap, ending nearly half a minute ahead, but lost seconds to Sergei Tchepikov (Russia, 28), who improved all the way through the course. Eventually, his 6.3-second lead after the fourth loop turned into 0.8 seconds in goal; it was enough, though, and Hanevold could celebrate his second Olympic medal on the individual event. Jay Hakkinen become the first American to finish in the Top 10 ever in the Winter Olympic biathlon with his 10th-place finish.\n\nResults \n\nOne Austrian athlete was disqualified after the IOC determined they had violated the Anti-Doping rules; Wolfgang Perner had originally placed 60th.\n\nThe race was held at 13:00.\n\nReferences\n\nMen's biathlon at the 2006 Winter Olympics"}

The group's headquarters are at Reykjavík Airport in Reykjavík. The corporation is the largest in Iceland, with 125 billion ISK in revenue in 2013.\n\nOperations \nIcelandair Group focuses on the international airline and tourism sectors, with Iceland as the cornerstone of its international route network. The business concept of the group is built exclusively on Icelandair's route network and on marketing Iceland as a year-round destination.\n\nDuring 2013 the group employed an average of 2,850 full-time employees. 1,387 of those were employed by Icelandair. The number of employees had been rising steadily from 2,028 in 2010.\n\nIcelandair Group is the parent company of nine subsidiaries that form the two business segments of Route Network and Tourism Services. In addition to passenger flights operated by Icelandair, the group has vast interests in most aspects of Icelandic tourism and aviation, including hotel chains, travel agencies, domestic airlines and cargo, support services, as well as fledgling ACMI and lease operations.\n\nHistory \n\nIcelandair Group traces its roots to 1937 when the airline Flugfélag Akureyrar, was founded at Akureyri on the north coast of Iceland. In 1943 the company moved its headquarters to the capital Reykjavík and changed its name to Air Iceland, which later assumed the international trade name Icelandair.\n\nIn 1944 another Icelandic airline was founded, Loftleiðir, by three young pilots returning from flight training in Canada. Initially, both companies concentrated on Icelandic domestic air services but then began international flights between Iceland and other countries. In 1953 Loftleiðir pioneered low-fare services across the North Atlantic and became quite successful for the greater part of two decades.\n\nIn 1973, however, it was agreed to merge both Air Iceland and Loftleiðir under a new holding company, Flugleiðir. In October 1979 Flugleiðir assumed all operating responsibilities of its two parents and decided to use Icelandair as its international trade name, retaining the Flugleiðir name for the Icelandic domestic market.\n\nIn January 2003 Flugleiðir became a holding company with 11 subsidiaries in the travel and tourist industry in Iceland with Icelandair being the largest subsidiary. In 2005 the name Flugleiðir was changed to FL Group which would concentrate on investment, while Icelandair continued its flight operations under the aegis of a separate company, Icelandair Group. The board of directors of FL Group announced in February 2006 its intention to list Icelandair Group on Iceland Stock Exchange. Then in December of the same year the company was listed as ICEAIR on the ICEX.\n\nThe next year FL Group landed in dire financial straits and then Icelandair Group was hit by the 2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis. In 2009 Icelandair Group started a financial restructuring, which was successfully completed in February 2011.\n\nOn 5 November 2018, Icelandair Group announced that it had made a purchase agreement to acquire all shares of competitor WOW air. The intention was that, after approval of the agreement by shareholders, the two airlines would continue to operate as separate brands. However, the merger was abandoned less than a month later. WOW air then held talks with Indigo Partners; after those talks failed on 21 March 2019, Icelandair Group briefly but unsuccessfully resumed discussions, before WOW air's subsequent cessation of operations on 28 March. Icelandair was one of several airlines to propose special \"rescue fares\" for stranded WOW air passengers.\n\nShareholders \n\nMost of the shareholders of Icelandair Group are pension and investment funds in Iceland. The Pension Fund of Commerce is the biggest shareholder, with 14.36% of shares at the end of 2013. About 22% of the shares are held by small shareholders with less than 0.70% of the shares each.\n\nSubsidiaries \n\nThe subsidiaries of Icelandair Group:\n\n Icelandair\n Icelandair Cargo\n\nDefunct subsidiaries include:\n\n Air Iceland Connect\n Loftleidir Icelandic\n VITA\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nIcelandair\nHolding companies of Iceland\nAirline holding companies\n1937 establishments in Iceland\nHolding companies established in 1937\nCompanies based in Reykjavík\nIcelandic brands\nAirlines established in 1937\nCompanies listed on Nasdaq Iceland"}

{"id": "4048575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akif%20Pirin%C3%A7ci", "title": "Akif Pirinçci", "text": "Akif Pirinçci (; born 20 October 1959) is a Turkish-born German writer who is best known internationally for his novel Felidae. After a highly controversial speech for the Pegida movement in 2015, he was cancelled and delisted by his publishers, Amazon and most booksellers in Germany.\n\nPolitical activity\n\nRelationship with right-wing organisations \n\nWhile writing and publishing these non-fiction essays, Pirinçci also increasingly came in contact with functionaries of the anti-Islamic movement Pegida, the right-wing populist party Alternative for Germany, and the small right-wing German Freedom Party, who organized lecture tours where Pirinçci would read from his two political essay books. When he faced criticism in May 2014, he justified these contacts by telling the online blog of the newspaper Die Zeit \"I don't give a flying fuck if people call me a Nazi, I don't give a damn.\" (\"Es geht mir am Arsch vorbei, wenn man mich einen Nazi nennt, das ist mir scheißegal\").\n\nDefamation suit \n\nOn 20 January 2015, the local paper General-Anzeiger reported that Pirinçci had been found liable for defamation in a civil suit brought by a professor of sociology and biology, whom Pirinçci had described as a \"mentally sick, manic queer with a screw loose\" (\"geisteskranken, durchgeknallten Schwulen mit Dachschaden\"). Pirinçci had also described the professor's theories as a \"jewel of stupidity\" (\"Juwel der Doofheit\").\n\n2015 Pegida speech \n\nAt the first anniversary of the Pegida protests in Dresden on 19 October 2015, Pirinçci was invited as keynote speaker. He accused German politicians of being \"Gauleiter against their own people\" and called Germany's government a \"shit state\" (\"Scheißstaat\"). Further, according to Pirinçci, Muslims want to \"pump infidels full of their Muslim juice\" (\"Ungläubige mit ihrem Moslemsaft vollpumpen\") and stated that Germany is becoming a \"Muslim garbage dump\" (\"Moslemmüllhalde\"). He called the German Green Party a \"Party of child fuckers\" (\"Kinderfickerpartei\"), and the spokesperson for the mosque in Erfurt a \"Muslim guy with a Taliban beard\" (\"Moslemfritzen mit Talibanbart\"), who had as much to do with German culture as \"my asshole with the production of perfume\" (\"wie mein Arschloch mit Parfümherstellung\").\n\nHowever, the most-widely spread quote from Pirinçci's 19 October speech was, \"Unfortunately, the concentration camps are out of order at the moment!\" (\"Aber die KZs sind ja leider derzeit außer Betrieb!\"), which was met with applause from the crowd. In a wider context, Pirinçci's concentration camps statement was intended to accuse critics of Pegida of intending to send Pegida members to said concentration camps. Pirinçci's remarks were apparently deemed too offensive by the crowd, and was booed off the stage.\n\nWithin 24 hours after first quotes from Pirinçci's Pegida speech appeared in the media, his publishers Goldmann and Random House issued statements that they had cancelled their contracts with Pirinçci and would no longer sell any of his books, and the webmaster to his online blog also cancelled Pirinçci's contract. At the same time, Amazon Germany chose to de-list his books so they can't be found through searches or ordered through the website. A few days later, all relevant book wholesalers in Germany (Libri, Umbreit, and KNV) also stopped ordering his books, and many independent bookstores issued statements that they would refuse to order his books, even upon request. This reaction by bookstores was criticized by columnist Jan Fleischhauer in Der Spiegel as amounting to authoritarian censorship. Volker Beck, member of parliament for the German Green Party, filed charges against Pirinçci for public incitement to commit criminal acts and incitement to hatred. A spokesperson for the federal prosecutor's office confirmed that an investigation is ongoing.\n\nTwo weeks after his Pegida speech, Pirinçci told Der Spiegel that the boycott of all his books overnight (except for the two political essay collections at Manufactum) as well as his public notoriety resulting from the affair made him seriously consider emigration.\n\nList of literary works \n Tränen sind immer das Ende (1980)\n Der Rumpf (literally meaning \"the torso\") (1992)\n Yin (1997)\n The Back Door (German: Die Damalstür) (2001)\n Der letzte Weltuntergang: Krimi-Erzählungen (\"The Final Apocalypse\") (2007)\n Volltreffer (2011), written under the pseudonym Cedric Arnold\n\nFelidae \n Felidae (German: Felidae) (1989)\n Felidae II aka Felidae on the Road (German: Francis.

He ascended the throne after replacing his elder brother Govinda II. Govinda II had become unpopular among his subjects on account of his various misconducts as a ruler, including excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures. This according to the historian Kamath is evident from the Karhad plates of Krishna III. The Dhulia grant of 779 and Garugadahalli inscription of 782 proclaim Dhruva the emperor. Though some historians claim that Dhruva revolted and grabbed the throne, other  historians feel the transition of the throne from Govinda II to Dhruva was peaceful and may have happened willingly. He earned titles like Kalivallabha, Srivallabha, Dharavarsha, Maharajadhiraja and Parameshvara.\n\nSuccess in north and east\n\nDhruva Dharavarsha had a high political aspiration and he actively pursued the goal of expanding the frontiers of Rashtrakuta domination. In North India, he subjugated the rulers of Kannauj. In central India, he defeated the Vatsaraja of the Gurjara Prathihara Empire, and Dharmapala of the Pala Empire of Bengal (who was eager to rule Kannauj) in a battle in the Ganges - Yamuna doab. However, these great victories  brought him no permanent land gains but only a lot of material gain and fame. However another historian has claimed that Dhruva's empire stretched from Ayodhya in the north to Rameshvaram in the south.\n\nVictories in the Deccan and South\nHe humbled Vishnuvardhana IV, an Eastern or Vengi Chalukyan king in 784 and forged an alliance by marrying his daughter named Silabhattarika as per the Jetvai grant of 786. Thereafter, he defeated Shivamara II, the Western Ganga Dynasty ruler of Gangavadi, and imprisoned him and appointed his own son, Prince Kambarasa as the governor. He also forced Pallava Nandivarman II to accept the suzerainty of Rashtrakuta who paid him handsomely with many elephants. He undertook campaigns to Kanchi in 785 and again against the Western Ganga Dynasty in 788.\n\nPan-India power\nDuring his reign, Rashtrakutas emerged as a true pan-India power, controlling large regions across the Indian subcontinent. He was succeeded by his third son, Govinda III (793–814) whose reign was also marked by brilliant military success and exploits.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n History of Karnataka, Mr. Arthikaje\n\n793 deaths\nHistory of Karnataka\nHindu monarchs\nRashtrakuta emperors\n8th-century Indian monarchs"}
{"id": "4048588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos%20Chagas%20Filho", "title": "Carlos Chagas Filho", "text": "Carlos Chagas Filho (September 10, 1910 – February 16, 2000) was a Brazilian physician, biologist and scientist active in the field of neuroscience. He was internationally renowned for his investigations on the neural mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of electrogenesis by the electroplaques of electric fishes. He was also an important scientific leader, being one of the founders of the Biophysics Institute of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and was also a president for 16 years of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and president of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (1965–1967).\n\nLife\nHe was the second son of Carlos Chagas (1879–1934), an eminent scientist who is credited with the discovery of Chagas disease. His oldest brother was Evandro Chagas (1905–1940), also a physician and scientist specialized, like his father, in tropical medicine.\n\nHe studied medicine from 1926 to 1931 at the Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Brasil (presently the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). While a student he worked at Manguinhos, where the Instituto Oswaldo Cruz was founded by the physician Oswaldo Cruz (1872–1917) and where his father worked, as well as at a hospital in Lassance, state of Minas Gerais, where his father had discovered Chagas disease. After graduation, he went to become a director of this hospital during 1932. But what he really liked to do was biomedical research, following the example of his father and colleagues, so in the next years he worked with several leaders in the field of physiology, such as Miguel Osório de Almeida (1890–1952) and José Carneiro Felippe. One year after graduation, he accepted a teaching post as assistant professor at the Medical School, in the chair of Biological Physics. With the death of its incumbent, Lafayette Rodrigues Pereira, he became its chairman and full professor.\n\nFeeling the need to specialize further in neurophysiology, Filho travelled to France, where he worked with René Wurmser and Alfred Fessard, in Paris, and to England, where he worked with A.V. Hill (1886–1977). Returning to Brazil, he established a Laboratory of Biophysics at the Medical School and assembled a group of students and researchers. In 1945 he achieved the elevation of the Laboratory to the Biophysics Institute, which in a short time became one of the most important and excellent research centers in Brazil. He was its director for a long time, as well as the dean of the Medical School. The Institute presently bears his name. Carlos Chagas Filho retired in 1980, but continued to work steadfastly almost until his death, at 89 years of age.\n\nWork\nFilho's main scientific contribution was centered on the study of the electroplaques of the \"poraquê\" or electric eel (Electrophorus electricus), actually a fresh water electric fish native to the Amazon. With his group, he made important and original advances in the elucidation of its anatomy and electrophysiology, cytochemistry, as well as its nervous control. He discovered the brain command structures which control electrical discharges. He discovered also that the electroplaques has two kinds of excitability, one which is direct, and another which is reflex via the nervous pathways. He studied also the effects of curare on the electroplaques, which are modified striated muscles and thus have synaptic transmission based on acetylcholine (curare is an antagonist of this neurotransmitter). Filho also isolated the ACh membrane receptor.\n\nAs an educator, Filho left an important influence on biomedical research in Brazil, through his many scientific disciples and colleagues at the Biophysics Institute, such as Aristides Azevedo Pacheco Leão. It was during the initial years of the Institute, also, that Rita Levi-Montalcini (1909-), then a young researcher of Jewish descent who had to escape fascism, worked towards her important discoveries on neurotrophic factors, supported by Carlos Chagas Filho. She later received the Nobel Prize of Physiology and Medicine.\n\nHe published several books, including an autobiography, a biographical memoir about his father and more than 100 scientific papers.\n\nScientific leadership and honours \nDr. Chagas Filho played a significant role as international leader and representative of Brazilian science abroad. He was a Brazilian delegate and ambassador (1966) to UNESCO in Paris, and member of the Research Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), in Washington, DC. At the United Nations he was president of the Special Committee for the Application of Science and Technology to Development. Together with Nobel Prize winner, physicist Abdus Salam (1926–1996), he founded the International Federation of Institutes for Advanced Sciences (IFIAS).\n\nIn 1972, he was appointed by Pope Paul VI to the presidency of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which he occupied until 1989. During his tenure, he was distinguished with the historical task of rehabilitating Galileo Galilei by the Roman Catholic Church and with coordinating a study of the historical and scientific validity of the Turin shroud. He was deeply religious and sought to reconcile science and religion as best as possible. Thus, he led the Academy of Sciences through a number of important meetings and publications, examining controversial issues such as the brain and conscience, and attracting great scientific personalities to the Academy, including a number of Nobel awardees.\n\nIn Brazil he was a member, vice-president and president of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences (1941–2000) and member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters (1974–2000), a member of the National Research Council and one of the founders and member of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science.\n\nCarlos Chagas Filho was awarded with 16 titles of Honoris Causa Doctor in many national and foreign universities, and 19 decorations, including that of Légion d'Honneur (1979) and the Brazilian Order of Scientific Merit. He was a member of the French Académie des Sciences and Académie Nationale de Médecine, Academia das Ciências de Lisboa, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, American Philosophical Academy, Royal Academy of Belgium, Romanian Academy of Sciences and the International Academy of the History of Sciences.\n\nAmong his many scientific awards, he received the Moinho Santista Science Prize (1960); the Prêmio Álvaro Alberto para a Ciência e Tecnologia (1988); and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca, by the Fondation Simone et Cino Del Duca, France (1989).\n\nBibliography\n Chagas Filho, C.

At the time of the 2011 Census, the population had decreased to 976.\n\nDescription\n\nThe village has one church, one chapel, two pubs (the Midland Hotel and the Joiner's Arms), a primary school, retained fire station, a Lakes & Dales Co-operative supermarket and post office, livestock auction mart, swimming pool and campsite , railway station (part of the Settle-Carlisle line) and the Bell's of Lazonby bakery complex. There is also an independent wooden toy shop, Croglin Toys & Designs (www.croglindesigns.co.uk) which is located in the old school (approx. 18th century), and an independent petrol station. The village has its own village hall with snooker club and allotments.\n\nThe parish church of St. Nicholas forms a united benefice with churches at nearby Great Salkeld and Kirkoswald. The church was rebuilt in 1864-6 to a design by Anthony Salvin, at the expense of the Macleans of Lazonby Hall.  A notable feature is the woodwork executed by Canon B W Wilson, Rector 1877-1920. This can be seen on the south door, north vestry door, the pulpit and the chancel, organ and tower screens. There is an imposing unornamented wheel cross at top of the graveyard, possibly 10th century. There are 4 bells hung for full-circle ringing.\n\nIn recent years many new housing developments have sprung up in the village. The village today is lived in mostly by people who work in either Penrith or Carlisle.\n\nThe civil parish of Lazonby contains no other villages but does include the settlements of Baronwood and Brackenbank. At Low Plains there is a mineral water bottling plant which bottles \"Aqua Pura\" mineral water.  At one time the parish included the Chapelry of Plumpton within which were the settlements of Salkeld Gate, Brockleymoor, Plumpton Foot and Theifside. Plumpton, (or Plumpton Wall) was a chapelry or township of Lazonby until 1866.\n\nEvents\n\nKirkoswald Methodist Youth Guild, which is for 11 plus, have been doing a local pantomime for more than 40 years now in the local village hall. They meet up and do other activities throughout the year, but the pantomime has become somewhat of a local legend and people come from far and wide to see it.\n\nSince 2008 there has been a bi-annual music concert in Lazonby which takes place on the school field.

{"id": "4048612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%20Rantoul%20Jr.", "title": "Robert Rantoul Jr.", "text": "Robert Rantoul Jr. (August 13, 1805August 7, 1852) was an American lawyer and politician from Massachusetts.\n\nRantoul was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1835–1839), the commission to revise the laws of Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts Board of Education (1837–1842). He was the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts (1846–1849). He was elected in 1850 to the United States House of Representatives for the 32nd Congress. Before his term there began, he was named as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Robert Charles Winthrop, who had been appointed after the resignation of Daniel Webster and resigned when he failed to win election to a full term. Rantoul served in the Senate from February 1 to March 3, 1851, and then in the House from March 4, 1851, until his death. He was buried in Central Cemetery, Beverly, Massachusetts. Rantoul had a wife, Jane Elizabeth Woodbury, and two children, Robert S. Rantoul and Charles W. Rantoul.\n\nEarly life\nRantoul was born on August 13, 1805, in Beverly, Massachusetts. He was the eldest son of Robert and Joanna Lovett Rantoul. He attended the common schools and Phillips Andover Academy and graduated from Harvard University in 1826.\n\nFrom his early years, Rantoul exhibited a precociousness, maturity, and love for learning that made an indelible impression on those around him.  As a child, Rantoul was known for his \"ingeniousness, veracity, modesty, docility, and tender conscientiousness.\" An extract taken from his childhood journal, written at age 8, reads: \"Jan. 4, 1814. Gained the following idea, namely, that I had better sometimes be imposed upon, than never to trust.\"\n\nAt age 14, Rantoul enrolled at Phillips Andover Academy, where he would study under the tutelage of the famous educator John Adams. Recalling Rantoul, one Andover classmate stated: \"The trait which impressed me the most, was his unquestionable thirst for knowledge, which he sought for gratification in every field of human inquiry. Whatever arrested his attention, whether it were a paper in the Spectator, a speech in Congress, a new poem in Lord Byron's, or recent invention in the arts, it absorbed all his faculties, and was thoroughly mastered and digested before he left it.\"\n\nIn 1822, Rantoul entered the freshman class at Harvard College. At Harvard, Rantoul was described as \"indefatigably industrious.\" By some accounts, Rantoul spent 14 hours a day studying, though he preferred to study subjects according to his own intellectual interests, rather than follow the prescribed college course.\n\nProfessional life\nAfter graduating from Harvard in 1826, Rantoul began studying law in Salem, Massachusetts, under the tutelage of John Pickering and later under the Hon. Leverett Saltonstall. In 1829, Rantoul was admitted to the Massachusetts state bar. In 1830, Rantoul took his first case: the defense of one Knapps for the murder of one Mr. White, a wealthy and well-liked man from Salem. Rantoul's decision to defend Knapps was unpopular amongst the citizens of Salem, and Rantoul knew it. Public feelings toward the accused in Salem at that time were particularly negative and hostile. This unhappy state of affairs, made Rantoul all the more resolute in his decision to provide counsel to Knapps; Rantoul \"felt in every way the unjust and sickening effects of this excited state of feeling in the public; an excitement which he regarded not only as hostile to the accused, but to the calmness and the fairness of judicial proceedings, in a case of life and death.\" Rantoul's decision to defend Knapps under these circumstances was in many ways symbolic of the type of dedication to fairness and justice that would characterize the remainder of Rantoul's career. Unfortunately, the decision also came at a cost: for his role in the defense of Knapps, Rantoul lost many friends, earned widespread public ire, and was ultimately forced to leave Salem.\n\nUpon leaving Salem, Rantoul moved to South Reading, Massachusetts, in 1830. In 1832, Rantoul move to Gloucester, Massachusetts, where in four successive years he was voted to the Massachusetts state legislature.\n\nIn 1838, Rantoul moved to Boston, Massachusetts. In Boston, Rantoul would come across many of the same challenges that he faced as a young lawyer in Salem, namely opposition from the wealthy and elite whose political views differed so starkly from his own. As a liberal fighting on behalf of the common man in a city so dominated by a wealthy and conservative few, Rantoul earned himself a reputation as \"a bold champion of political justice; an inflexible and eloquent advocate of the rights of man, as above those of property, whether held by individuals, or corporations. He had a sincere and just respect for mental power, exerted in any useful direction, and, especially, for that intelligence, which, triumphing over adverse circumstances, is able to secure success to enterprise and reward to industry. But he had a higher respect for integrity, justice, and truth; a higher respect for the rights of the poor, the weak, and defenceless. He acknowledged no authority in an oligarchy of wealth; no other nobility than that conferred by beneficence to mankind, by services actually rendered to his fellow-creatures.  What he regarded as the humanity and justice of his political opinions, were treated, by the selfish and the arrogant, as treasonable to wealth.  And hence the fact that neither the extent, nor the emoluments of his professional practice, indicated his merit as a lawyer, or its just reward.  In short, he was a democratic lawyer in the city of Boston.\"\n\nWhile in Boston, Rantoul took on a number of landmark cases, always in pursuit of what he believed to be right and just.\n\nCommonwealth v. Hunt\nThe first such case was Commonwealth v. Hunt, known at the time as the Journeymen Boot-Makers' Case, in which Rantoul argued on behalf of an organized labor movement in Massachusetts. The case involved the yet unsettled question of whether labor unions were legal in the United States. After an unfavorable decision at trial, Rantoul appealed the case to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts where Justice Lemuel Shaw eventually determined that labor organizations were lawful provided they were organized for legal purposes and used legal means to achieve their goals. With this victory, Rantoul \"succeeded in obtaining one of the completest triumphs that it ever fell to the lot of an American lawyer to achieve.\"\n\nRhode Island trials\nIn 1842, Rantoul came to the defense of several individuals charged by the government with attempts \"of a revolutionary character\" for their efforts to extend suffrage to African-Americans in Massachusetts. The defendants were arrested, imprisoned, and tried not in the same county in which they allegedly committed the acts, but in counties where partisan judges and packed juries, \"resembling those of the worst periods of English history were selected as the triers.\" In order \"[t]o unloose this unjust grasp of power, and to save some of the best citizens of Rhode Island from these anti-American and tyrannical modes of proceeding, Mr. Rantoul was employed as leading counsel; and he brought to bear, on the merits of the question, a force of reason, and an extent of learning, which startled and electrified the court, and a convincing eloquence, which drew involuntary outbursts of applause from a numerous and enlightened assembly . . . Even Webster, the opposing counsel, clapped his hands with applause. The rights of the person, and the rights of the state, their relations to each other, and their just limitations, were never perhaps more ably reviewed, or justly defined in a forensic address.\"\n\nThe next day, The Providence Express published the following account of Rantoul's argument in the case: \"The able and conclusive argument of this distinguished gentlemen occupied two hours and a half in the delivery. It was, throughout, the most learned address to which we have ever listened . . . In the hands of some men this subject would have been dull and without interest. Mr. Rantoul made it far otherwise to the crowded audience who listened to him . . . Can a man be tried in one county, for an act charged in the indictment in another county? He argued that he could not be . . . He showed this by examining the object of the institution of jury trials, the sources, and the original form of this institution, the meaning of the terms in Magna Carta, by which trial by his peers is secured to every freeman, the course of the common law in England, since the Great Charter, the statutes in England, in derogation from this common law of England on this point, and the breaking out of the American Revolution . . . Mr. Rantoul set forth the substantial benefits of this right, the growth of which he traced from the times of Alfred and Charlemagne, and conjured the court not to throw away a guarantee which had ripened under the varied experience of a thousand years, for a forced and unnatural construction of a statute, which was itself, at least, of very doubtful constitutionality.\"\n\nSims Case\nIn 1851, Rantoul became involved in one of the most infamous cases in Massachusetts history. On the morning of April 4, 1851, Thomas Sims, an escaped slave arrested in Boston under the Fugitive Slave Act, was being held by guards outside the state courthouse in Boston. On his way to his office, Rantoul noticed the crowd and stopped to ask what was going on, to which someone in the crowd replied: \"They have caught a negro.\" At the request of fellow attorney C.G. Loring, Rantoul made his way into the courthouse. When a friend of Rantoul's went to the court house in search of Rantoul later that morning, he found Rantoul already engaged in the service of counsel for the alleged fugitive without having had a moment's preparation.\n\nAlthough the case was ultimately lost and Sims was returned to servitude, Rantoul is remembered for his willingness to defend Thomas Sims on a moment's notice, his able defense of Sims during trial, and his portentous objection to the constitutionality of the law at issue: the Fugitive Slave Act.\n\nViews\nWhile Rantoul was undoubtedly among the ablest lawyers of his time, and committed to furthering just ends in all manners of cases, many of his strongest efforts to promote social justice came outside of the courtroom. There were certain causes of social reform and progress to which Rantoul was so committed, and to which he would devote so much time and effort, that it was said one could have been in Rantoul's company for weeks at a time without ever being reminded that he was a lawyer or politician. Among these causes were the codification of the common law, the promotion of public education through lyceums, and the abolishment of capital punishment in the United States.\n\nCodification of the law\nThroughout his life, Rantoul was a fierce advocate for the codification of the common law. He believed that judge-made rules were tantamount to judicial legislation, and he argued that freemen should be amenable to no law but the written law as sanctioned by representatives of the people. In 1836, as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Rantoul delivered a speech summarizing his views on the common law, which read: \"Judge-made law is ex-post facto law, and therefore unjust. An act is not forbidden by statute, but it becomes void by judicial construction. The legislature could not effect this, for the Constitution forbids it . . . . No man can tell what the common law is; therefore it is not law: for the law is a rule of action; but a rule which is unknown can govern no man's conduct. Not withstanding this, [the common law] has been called the perfection of human reason. The Common Law is the perfection of human reason,--just as alcohol is the perfection of sugar. The subtle spirit of the Common Law is reason double distilled, till what was wholesome and nutritive becomes rank poison . . . . The judge makes law, by extorting from precedents something which they do not contain. He extends his precedents, which were themselves the extension of others, till, by this accommodating principle, a whole system of law is built up without the authority or interference of the legislator.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts Legislature eventually established a committee, chaired by Justice Joseph Story, to consider the expediency of codifying the common law of Massachusetts. Although the legal profession of the time continued the historical preference for the common law, one sees echoes of Rantoul's sentiments even today through efforts like the Restatements (summations of common law standards widely adopted by state legislatures as statute) and the judicial trend toward textualist interpretations.\n\nLyceums\nRantoul was also deeply committed to public education. In the winter of 1828–1829, Rantoul established the first Lyceum in New England. These Lyceums served as a center for debate and the exchange of ideas, with the goal of educating the public on matters of wide public significance. At these Lyceums, Rantoul displayed \"that remarkable aptitude for debate, that keen logical acuteness in argument, and those ready and ample resources of wit and learning which afterwards so distinguished him in the courts of law and the halls of legislation.\" Rantoul's ultimate ambition in these Lyceums, however, was not to dazzle crowds with oration for oration's sake, but to begin a discourse on important matters and convince the public of what he believed to be right and true.  In 1833, Rantoul published An Address to the Workingmen of the United States of America as one of the first numbers of a series of tracts published by the Committee of the Middlesex County Lyceum.\n\nCapital punishment\nOwing to the influence of his father, who was himself strongly against the death penalty, Rantoul was from his earliest days a strong advocate for the abolishment of capital punishment. In 1835, Rantoul formed a committee in the Massachusetts State Legislature to propose the repeal of all capital punishment laws in the state. On March 31, 1835, Rantoul delivered a speech in support of the proposed repeal of the death penalty, leading all but 13 members of the house to vote in favor of the proposal. His floor speeches on the subject of capital punishment were printed, and eventually became so widely distributed that they became regarded as authoritative in France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. Years later, upon learning of Rantoul's death, U.S. Senator Charles Sumner stated in Congress: \"Some of [Rantoul's] most devoted labors, commencing in the legislature of Massachusetts, were for the abolition of capital punishment.  Perhaps no person since the consummate jurist, Edward Livingston, has done so much by reports, articles, letters, and speeches, to commend this reform to the country. With its final triumph, in the progress of civilization, his name will be indissolubly connected.\"\n\nDeath\nOn August 7, 1852, Rantoul died unexpectedly due to complications with erysipelas. a few days before his 47th birthday  In announcing his death, the Taunton Democrat printed, \"Mr. Rantoul stood in the front rank of the legal profession. As a forensic speaker, he had few equals, and scarcely a superior. . . . He was equally in his element, whether at the bar or in the forum,--before the people or in the halls of legislation. . . .  His was one of the progressive minds of the age. To the cause of free education, he gave his earliest influence and support; to temperance, his voice and his example. Of the abolition of the death penalty, it may be said that he was its ablest advocate, and that he died, like John Quincy Adams, clothed in the armor of compromising hostility to what he deemed the encroachments of the institution of southern slavery. . . . His death is no common loss; to his family, a loss we cannot realize; to his constituents, which none can supply; and to his party and country, a deprivation like the deaths of Silas Wright and Levi Woodbury, tenfold more afflicting for the suddenness of its occurrence.\"\n\nTributes\nRantoul was the subject of a bust by the self-taught Massachusetts sculptor Joanna Quiner, cast in plaster and presented to the Boston Athenaeum in 1842; it was the first sculpture by a woman to be shown there when it was exhibited in 1846, and remains in the collection.\n\nSee also\n\nList of United States Congress members who died in office (1790–1899)\n Rantoul, Kansas\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1805 births\n1852 deaths\nHarvard University alumni\nDemocratic Party members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives\nUnited States Attorneys for the District of Massachusetts\nPeople from Beverly, Massachusetts\nDemocratic Party United States senators from Massachusetts\nDemocratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts\n19th-century American legislators"}

In 1888 he wrote his habilitation about \"Projektion und graphische Krystallberechnung\" (Projection and graphical Crystal Classification) under the same supervisor as his doctoral dissertation. He founded the Institut für Mineralogie und Kristallographie in Heidelberg in association with the Josefine and Eduard von Portheim Stiftung, which he founded in memory of his maternal ancestors. In 1893, he became an adjunct professor (Honorarprofessor) at the University of Heidelberg and in 1913, he was awarded membership in the Heidelberger Akademie der Wissenschaften (Heidelberg Academy of Sciences).

{"id": "4048642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harihara%20I", "title": "Harihara I", "text": "Harihara I, also called Hakka and Vira Harihara I, was the founder of the Vijayanagara Empire, which he ruled from 1336 to 1356 CE. He and his successors formed the Sangama dynasty, the first of four dynasties to rule the empire. He was the eldest son of Bhavana Sangama, the chieftain of a cowherd pastoralist community, who claimed Yadava descent.\n\nThe early life of Hakka and his brother Bukka is relatively unknown and most accounts are based on various speculative theories. According to the theories Bukka and Hakka were commanders in the army of the Kakatiya King of Warangal. After the King of Warangal was defeated by Muhammad bin Tughlaq, Bukka and his brother were taken prisoners and sent to Delhi, where they both converted to Islam. Bukka and his brother eventually escaped, reconverted to Hinduism under the influence of the sage Vidyaranya, and founded the Vijayanagara Empire. \n\nBallappa Dandanayaka, a nephew of the Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III, had married a daughter of Harihara. This shows that Harihara was associated with the Hoysala Court. Immediately after coming to power, he built a fort at Barkuru, on the west coast of present-day Karnataka. It appears from inscriptions that he was administering the northern parts of present-day Karnataka from his seat at Gooty (Gutti), Ananthpur district in 1339. He initially controlled the northern portions of the Hoysala Empire before taking full control over its entire range after the death of Hoysala Veera Ballala III in 1343. Kannada inscriptions of his time call him Karnataka Vidya Vilas (\"master of great knowledge and skills\"), Bhashege tappuva rayara ganda (\"punisher of those feudatories who don't keep their promise\"), and Arirayavibhada (\"fire to enemy kings\"). Among his brothers, Kampana governed the Nellur region, Muddppa administered the Mulabagalu region, Marappa oversaw Chandragutti and Bukka Raya was his second in command.\n\nHis initial military exploits established his control over the valley of Tungabhadra River, and gradually he expanded his control to certain regions of Konkan and Malabar Coast. By that time, the Hoysala ruler Veera Ballala III had died fighting the Sultan of Madurai, and the vacuum thus created allowed Harihara to emerge as a sovereign power with all the Hoysala territories under his rule.\n\nAn inscription dated 1346 regarding a grant to the Sringeri matha describes Harihara I as the ruler of \"whole country between the eastern and the western seas\" and describes Vidya Nagara (that is, the city of learning) as his capital.\n\nHarihara I was succeeded by his brother Bukka I who emerged as the most distinguished amongst the five rulers (Panchasangamas) of the Sangama dynasty.\n\nAdministration\n\nHarihara was an able administrator. \nVijayanagar was the first southern Indian state to have hegemony over three major linguistic and cultural regions and to have established a degree of political unity among them. \nThe administration of the kingdom sporadically achieved some degree of centralization, although centrifugal tendencies regularly appeared. \nTo the original five rajyas (provinces) held by the Sangama brothers, new ones were added as territories were conquered. \nWithin and among these regions, a complex mosaic of rival chiefly houses exercised power to varying degrees, though not with the virtual autonomy that some historians have suggested . \nThe central administration had both a revenue and a military side, but the actual business of raising taxes and troops was mostly the responsibility of the provincial governors and their subordinates. \nThe central government maintained a relatively small body of troops, but it assigned a value to the lands held by the provincial governors and determined the number of troops that were to be supplied from the revenues of each province.\n\nHarihara was fully conscious of the dangers which the parvenu state faced both from both Hindu rival kings and the Delhi sultans. He strengthened the old fort of Badami as a protection against invasions from Delhi rulers. He fortified Gooty in Anantpur District as a safeguard against Hoysala kings.\n\nHe also converted Udayagiri into a strong fort and placed his younger brother Kampana in charge of it. With the help of his able minister Anantarasa Chikka Udaiya, he reorganized the civil administration that survived for more than two hundred years.\nUnder the nayankara system, military commanders were appointed 'nayaka' (local governor) and granted income from estates for the purpose of raising troops and maintain control over local chiefs.\n\nIn order to increase the resources of the state, he forced the farmers to cut down forests and bring this land under cultivation. The kingdom was divided into sthalas, nadus and simas. A number of officers were appointed to run the administration and collect the revenues.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n Dr. Suryanath U.

{"id": "4048662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreochromis", "title": "Oreochromis", "text": "Oreochromis is a large genus of oreochromine cichlids, fishes endemic to Africa and the Middle East. A few species from this genus have been introduced far outside their native range and are important in aquaculture. Many others have very small ranges; some are seriously threatened, and O. ismailiaensis and O. lidole possibly are extinct. Although Oreochromis primarily are freshwater fish of rivers, lakes and similar habitats, several species can also thrive in brackish waters and some even survive in hypersaline conditions with a salinity that far surpasses that of seawater. In addition to overfishing and habitat loss, some of the more localized species are threatened by the introduction of other, more widespread Oreochromis species into their ranges. This is because they—in addition to competing for the local resources—often are able to hybridize.\n\nOreochromis are fairly robust fish, and medium–small to very large cichlids that can reach up to  in total length depending on the exact species.\n\nTaxonomy\nSpecies in this genus, as well as those in several other oreochromine and tilapiine genera, share the common name \"tilapia\" and historically most were included in the genus Tilapia.\n\nOreochromis contains more than 30 species, and several undescribed forms exist. Judging from mtDNA sequence analysis, several clades seem to exist. Research is hampered because hybridization runs rampant in these fishes, which confounds mtDNA data (Wami tilapia is an example), and the fast speed of evolution makes choice of appropriate nuclear DNA sequences difficult. A comprehensive genetic study that included almost all the species, as well as the closely related Alcolapia, found that Oreochromis as currently defined is paraphyletic. For example, two Oreochromis species (O. amphimelas and O. esculentus) appear closer to Alcolapia than the remaining Oreochromis, and five other Oreochromis species (O. angolensis, O. lepidurus, O. niloticus, O. schwebischi and O. upembae) appear to be as distant from the \"core\" Oreochromis as they are from Alcolapia. A potential solution is to merge Alcolapia into Oreochromis, as done by Catalog of Fishes.\n\nSpecies\n\nThe 37 recognized species in this genus are:\n\n Oreochromis alcalica (Hilgendorf, 1905) (common Natron tilapia)\n Oreochromis amphimelas (Hilgendorf, 1905)\n Oreochromis andersonii (Castelnau, 1861) (three-spotted tilapia)\n Oreochromis angolensis (Trewavas, 1973)\n Oreochromis aureus (Steindachner, 1864) (blue tilapia)\n Oreochromis chungruruensis (C.

{"id": "4048682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John%20Clifford%2C%209th%20Baron%20Clifford", "title": "John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford", "text": "John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461) was a Lancastrian military leader during the Wars of the Roses in England. The Clifford family was one of the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century, and by the marriages of his sisters, John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon. He was orphaned at twenty years of age when his father was slain by partisans of the House of York at the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Margaret of Anjou, wife of King Henry VI, who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.\n\nClifford had already achieved prominence in the north where, as an ally of the son of the earl of Northumberland, he took part in a feud against the Neville family, the Percy's natural rivals in Yorkshire. This consisted of a series of armed raids, assaults and skirmishes, and included an ambush on one of the younger Nevilles' wedding parties in 1453. Historians have seen a direct connection between his involvement in the local feud in the north with the Nevilles, and his involvement in the national struggle against the duke of York, with whom the Nevilles were closely allied with in the late 1450s. Although this was supposedly a period of temporary peace between the factions, Clifford and his allies appear to have made numerous attempts to ambush the Neville and Yorkist lords.\n\nArmed conflict erupted again in 1459, and again Clifford was found on the side of King Henry and Queen Margaret. Clifford took part in the parliament that attainted the Yorkists – by now in exile – and he took a share of the profits from their lands, as well as being appointed to offices traditionally in their keeping. The Yorkist lords returned from exile in June 1460 and subsequently defeated a royal army at Northampton. As a result of the royalist defeat, Clifford was ordered to surrender such castles and offices as he had from the Nevilles back to them, although it is unlikely that he did so. In fact, he and his fellow northern Lancastrian lords merely commenced a campaign of destruction on Neville and Yorkist estates and tenantry, to such an extent that in December 1460, the duke of York and his close ally, the earl of Salisbury, raised an army and headed north to crush the Lancastrian rebellion. This winter campaign culminated in the Battle of Wakefield in the last days of the year, and was a decisive victory for the Lancastrian army, of which Clifford was by now an important commander. The battle resulted in the deaths of both York and Salisbury, but was probably most notorious for Clifford's slaying of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, York's seventeen-year-old second son and the younger brother of the future King Edward IV. This may have resulted in Clifford's being nicknamed 'Butcher Clifford', although historians disagree as to how widely used by contemporaries this term was.\n\nClifford accompanied the royal army on its march south early the next year, where, although wounded, he played a leading part in the second Battle of St Albans, and then afterwards with the Queen to the north. The Yorkist army, now under the command of Edward of York and Richard, Earl of Warwick, pursued the Lancastrians to Yorkshire and eventually defeated them at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461. Clifford though was not present; he had been slain in a skirmish with a Yorkist advance party the previous day. Following the coronation of the by-then victorious Edward IV, he was attainted and his lands confiscated by the Crown.\n\nBackground, youth, marriage and family\n\nThe Clifford family has been described as one of the greatest fifteenth-century families \"never to receive an earldom.\" John Clifford was born and baptised at Conisborough Castle on 8 April 1435, the son of Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford (1414–1455) by his wife Joan Dacre (bef. 1424 – bef. 1455). She was the daughter of Thomas de Dacre, 6th Baron Dacre of Gilsland, and Philippa de Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland. One of his godparents was his great-aunt Maud Clifford, Countess of Cambridge, whose dower house was Coningsburgh Castle. When she died in 1446, she left him numerous silver plate in her will. She had been the widow of Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, executed on 5 August 1415 for his part in the Southampton Plot, and she was said to have lived \"in great estate\" in the castle.\n\nClifford had three younger brothers and five sisters. Sir Roger Clifford, who married Joan Courtenay (born c. 1447), the eldest daughter of Thomas de Courtenay, 5th Earl of Devon, by Margaret Beaufort, the daughter of John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset. She married secondly, Sir William Knyvet of Buckenham, Norfolk. Next was Sir Robert Clifford, who eventually involved himself in the Perkin Warbeck plot against Henry VII. John Clifford's youngest brother was Sir Thomas Clifford, and his nearest sister was Elizabeth. She married firstly, Sir William Plumpton (1435–1461),  who was probably slain at the Battle of Towton in 1461, and secondly, John Hamerton. Another sister was Maud, who married firstly Sir John Harrington, and secondly, Sir Edmund Sutton. There was also Anne Clifford, who married firstly, Sir William Tempest, and secondly, William Conyers, esquire. John Clifford's youngest sisters were Joan (who married Sir Simon Musgrave) and Margaret (who married Robert Carr).\n\nIn 1454, John Clifford married Margaret Bromflete (1443 – 12 April 1493), who was the only daughter and heiress of Sir Henry Bromflete, Baron Vessy, and his second wife Eleanor FitzHugh. With her, Clifford had two sons and a daughter; his heir, Henry, who would become 10th baron, a younger son Richard, and a daughter Elizabeth. Elizabeth was later the wife of Sir Robert Aske (d. 21 February 1531) of Aughton, Yorkshire. Margaret Clifford survived her husband, and at some time before 14 May 1467 had remarried, to Sir Lancelot Threlkeld. Historian Henry Summerson has described his marriage, which gained the Cliffords estates, as he put it, \"in parts of the north relatively free from Neville domination.\"\n\nEarly career\nLittle is known of Clifford's early life or career until he appears on the records of 24 August 1453, as supporting the traditional allies of his family, the Percy family. The Percys were at that time engaged in a bitter feud – known as the Percy–Neville feud by historians – with their rivals for power in Yorkshire, the House of Neville. On this day Clifford joined Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont and Sir Richard Percy, sons of the earl of Northumberland, at Heworth Moor in their attempt to ambush the returning wedding party of Thomas Neville.\n\nClifford's career was transformed when, on 22 May 1455, his father was killed fighting Richard, Duke of York and York's Neville allies, the earls of Salisbury and Warwick at the first Battle of St Albans. John Clifford was still under age at the time, and was not able to prove his age in order to obtain livery of his lands until 16 June 1456. He entered into his inheritance less than a month later, and was appointed a Justice of the peace in Westmorland. Clifford inherited the barony of Clifford, the family seat at Skipton Castle and the hereditary office of High Sheriff of Westmorland. He was summoned to Parliament on 30 July 1460.\n\nIt is likely that for him, the death of his father personalised an already bitter struggle with the Nevilles. Michael Hicks, for example, has suggested that \"the heirs of the dead lords... now wanted revenge for their fathers' deaths. They were not particular whether by constitutional trial or by assassination.\" Warwick especially was held accountable. King Henry VI imposed a reconciliation between the warring factions of St Albans in early 1458, and commanded the various parties, including Clifford, to London. Clifford arrived there, a contemporary chronicler recorded, \"with a grete power,\" and demanded compensation for his father's death. In this, he was accompanied by the other \"yong lordes whoos fadres were sleyne at Seynt Albonys.\" Jointly with Lord Egremont and the new earl of Northumberland, Clifford is believed to have had an army of around 1,500 men in London in early 1458 where, with Egremont and the duke of Exeter, he attempted to ambush Warwick and York on their way to Westminster. It is likely that they had organised armed gangs for the purpose of arresting the Yorkist lords, if not assassinating them. The Mayor of London believed they came \"agaynst the peas,\" and excluded them from the city. Thus, Clifford and the others were forced to lodge at Temple Bar, between the city and Westminster, probably in a house of one of the various bishops that lined the route. The king, as arbitrator, resided out of London, at Berkhamsted Castle, and Clifford visited him there on 1 March – \"presumably to influence the result [but] probably unsuccessfully,\" says Hicks. Clifford later participated in what was known ceremonially as the 'Loveday' on the 24th of the month, which saw the king arbitrate a settlement between the warring parties. As a result of this, and as part of a general compensation package between the families of the battle's victors and losers, Clifford was to be paid £666 by the earl of Warwick. This was to be shared between John and his siblings.\n\nKing Henry's attempts at peacekeeping, however, came to little; indeed, it was around this time that Henry's forcible wife, Margaret of Anjou, became more involved in the partisan politics of the day and increasingly influential in government. Summerson has noted how Clifford's youth and energy \"made him an increasingly important supporter of the Lancastrian cause.\" Likewise, a pro-Lancastrian poem, using a favoured contemporary metaphor for government, the ship of State, referred to Clifford as a \"well good sayl\" of it. A few months later he was appointed to the King’s Bench for the West Riding of Yorkshire, but when a great council was summoned for October 1458, it seems that Clifford – along with other anti-York peers such as the dukes of Somerset and Exeter – were excluded from it.\n\nThe Wars of the Roses\n\nThe next point at which Clifford appears to have been fully involved in national politics was attending the parliament summoned to Coventry in November 1459. By this time the civil wars had broken out again in earnest: the Neville earl of Salisbury had defeated an attempted Lancastrian ambush of him at the Battle of Blore Heath that September, and had joined with the duke of York at the latter's castle in Ludlow. There, however, they had been forced into exile by superior crown forces, and as a result, a parliament had been called to attend to the Yorkists' attainders. This was the Parliament of Devils, and here Clifford swore allegiance to the new heir to the throne, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, on 11 December. As a result of the exiled Yorkists' attainders, their estates were available for redistribution by the crown to those who had remained loyal to it, and Clifford was granted the Honour of Penrith and the Penrith Castle, which had formerly been held by Salisbury. This was close enough to their own estates Westmorland – particularly their caput of Brougham Castle, near Penrith – that it has been suggested that it had been a particular bone of contention between the two families. In April the following year he was appointed warden of the western marches, an important position in the defence of the Anglo-Scottish border. It was also a traditional office of the Nevilles, and had most recently been held jointly by the earls of Salisbury and Warwick; now Clifford was ordered to raise a force to resist the Yorkists.\n\nIn June 1460 the exiled Yorkists successfully invaded England, and on 10 July they defeated a royal army at the Battle of Northampton, and captured the king. As a result, Clifford was now ordered to surrender Penrith castle and Honour back to the earl of Salisbury. But although the now-Yorkist government repeatedly sent messages, orders and instructions to Clifford in the north, he did not acknowledge them, and with Northumberland and Lord Roos, remained in control of most of the region. In October 1460, the duke of York claimed the throne, and a parliament was summoned to discuss this. The result of its deliberations was the Act of Accord, which disinherited the Prince of Wales in favour of York and his heirs. This, it has been said, was 'repugnant' to Clifford and his colleagues and strengthened their support for the queen. It seems that, although Clifford was summoned to attend, he stayed away, and probably met with Queen Margaret in Kingston upon Hull, where she was gathering Lancastrian lords and their retainers to her. Together, they had soon gathered a fighting force of thousands. Clifford was one of these lords who was subsequently accused of 'systematically' pillaging and looting the Yorkshire estates and tenants of York and Salisbury. In response to these attacks, York, Salisbury, and the latter's son Thomas led an army to the north. Encamped at York's castle at Sandal, on 30 December 1460, the two armies met at the Battle of Wakefield, where Clifford commanded one of the wings of the Lancastrian army. The Yorkist army was routed, and all three Yorkist lords were killed. Clifford was knighted by the Lancastrian commander, Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset prior to the battle commencing.\n\nDeath of the earl of Rutland\nOne modern historian has noted, however, that although Rutland's death brought Clifford \"considerable notoriety, much of it [was] first reported only several decades after the event.\" Henry Summerson dates the first published description of 'Butcher Clifford' as being not until the 1540s, by John Leland in his Itinerary, when he wrote that \"for killing of men at this bataill [Clifford] was caullid the boucher.\" The annalist William Worcester, writing contemporaneously says that Clifford killed Rutland on Wakefield Bridge, whilst the latter fled the battle. In the sixteenth century, this report was expanded by Edward Hall, which became the source of Shakespeare's account. This included the addition of various confirmed historical inaccuracies, such as describing Rutland as being aged twelve rather than seventeen, and that Clifford also beheaded York after the battle, whereas the duke almost certainly fell in the fighting. Historian J.R. Lander has said that most of the later descriptions of Clifford at Wakefield \"appear too late to be worthy of much credence\".\n\nDeath and attainder\nFollowing the victory at Wakefield, Clifford and other Lancastrian lords in the north attended Queen Margaret's Royal council in January; they soon led their army south. Gregory's Chronicle reports that everyone wore the Prince of Wales' cognizance, the ostrich feather badge.  On 17 February 1461 they encountered a Yorkist army, led by Warwick and his brother John Neville, at St Albans. This resulted in another resounding victory for the Lancastrians, and Henry VI was captured from Warwick and returned to his wife and son. It is possible that this reunion occurred in John Clifford's own tent after the battle. Instead of marching on London however, the royal army retreated to the north, Clifford with it, and a Yorkist force slowly trailing them from London. On 28 March 1461 portions of the two armies clashed whilst attempting to cross the River Aire at Ferrybridge, now called the Battle of Ferrybridge. The Lancastrian force, under Clifford, captured the bridge, but the Yorkists had forded the river upstream and flank-attacked Clifford's men. Traditionally, Clifford was killed at Dittingdale, possibly by a headless arrow in the throat, and buried in a common burial pit, along with the rest of the dead from that encounter. Despite being only a few miles away, the main Lancastrian army held its position and either did not or could not come to his aid.\n\nThe day after Clifford's death the bulk of the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies faced each other at the Battle of Towton. After what is now considered the biggest and possibly bloodiest battle ever to take place on English soil, the Lancastrians were routed, and the son of the duke of York was crowned King Edward IV. On 4 November 1461, at Edward's first parliament, Clifford was attainted and his estates and barony forfeited to the king; a large portion was later granted to the earl of Warwick. The story – which would later be repeated by George Edward Cokayne in his Complete Peerage – of how Clifford's widow, fearing her son, Henry, would be slain in retaliation for Rutland's death, sent him into hiding as a shepherd, is almost certainly a folklore. As Dr James Ross has pointed out, the young Henry Clifford was pardoned in 1472, and as early as 1466 was named publicly as receiving a bequest, although Ross does suggest that Henry may well have gone into hiding for a time from his father's enemies.\n\nFictional portrayals and later reputation\nAccording to Shakespeare's play Henry VI, Part 3, following Hall's Chronicle and Holinshed's Chronicles, John Clifford, after the Battle of Wakefield, slew in cold blood the young Edmund, Earl of Rutland, son of Richard, 3rd Duke of York. However, later authorities state that Rutland was slain during the battle.\n\nClifford is depicted in Sharon Kay Penman's historical novel, The Sunne in Splendour.\n\nReferences\n\nClifford, John Clifford, 9th Baron de\nClifford, John Clifford, 9th Baron de\n15th-century English nobility\nJohn\nClifford, John Clifford, 9th Baron de\nHigh Sheriffs of Westmorland\nClifford, John Clifford, 9th Baron de\nBarons de Clifford"}

It is named after Pott Shrigley in Cheshire. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 456. It lies within the Down District Council area.\n\nHistory \nShrigley is a small satellite industrial village which grew up around the large six-storey cotton mill built in 1824 by John Martin. In 1836, Shrigley mill had more power looms than any other factory in Ireland. In the following year, Samuel Lewis described it at length:\n\nThe Grecian gate pillars, and some of the subsidiary stone buildings, were probably survivors of the original mill and stood until recently. Naturally, the mill became the principal source of employment in the locality. Most of the workers lived in Killyleagh, but a number of blackstone workers' cottages were built in a cluster along the three streets at the mill gate.\n\nDuring his lifetime, the people of the district resolved to commemorate the contribution John Martin had made to their prosperity; a competition was held in 1870 for designs for a clock tower and drinking fountain in his honour; the premium was awarded to Timothy Hevey, a young Belfast architect apparently then working with Pugin and Ashlin in Dublin. The work was executed in 1871, and a High Victorian monument was erected at the cross-roads outside the mill gate. John Martin died in 1876 at the age of 79; Timothy Hevey died in 1878 at the age of 33.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1972, according to the Downpatrick Area Plan, 'a very extensive redevelopment project was completed involving the replacement of the early industrial village, the construction of 154 houses and two shops'. The new construction was suburban in style, and the people were all rehoused in a housing estate on the opposite hillside. Of the original buildings the Martin monument still stands, in isolation, at the mill gate.\n\nShrigley Monument (Martin Memorial) \n\n1871, designed by Timothy Hevey. A monument of brown stone, in three layers; the design has much in common with the Rossmore Memorial of about the same date in the Diamond of Monaghan town. The base, surrounded by iron railings, originally with an elaborate lamp at each corner, is square. Upon this, an octagonal arcade of round-headed arches, carried on columns with Ruskinian foliated capitals, surrounds the central shaft, which incorporates the drinking-fountain. Above this rises a square tower, supported by eight flying buttresses springing from pinnacles; in each face is a triple pointed opening divided by small foliate-capitaled columns. Above these openings are large circular oculi in which the clock (now entirely disappeared) displayed its four faces. The tower is surmounted by acute angled gable-pediments, with five-lobed ogee centre pieces; four corner pinnacles, the crockets now missing; and a pyramidal roof terminating in ornate cresting.\n\nDuring the 1970s the mill was used as a tannery employing many men and women from Shrigley and Killeagh. Atlantic Tanners were fine tanners of local cow hides shipped worldwide.\n\nReferences \n\nNI Neighbourhood Information Service\nUlster Architectural Heritage - East Down\n\nVillages in County Down"}

He was a co-founder and the president of one of America's first biotechnology companies, Centocor, which was founded in 1979 for the commercialising of monoclonal antibodies.  In 1999 he founded Neuronyx, Inc., for the manufacture of stem cells and the development of stem-cell therapies.\n\nEarly life and education\nSchoemaker was born in Deventer, Netherlands. He attended St. Bernardus School in Deventer, and Canisius College, Nijmegen.  In 1969 he moved to the United States to attend the University of Notre Dame, where he majored in chemistry, graduating in May 1972. Soon after he married Ann Postorino.\n\nHe then earned a doctorate in biochemistry in 1975 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Supervised by Paul Schimmel, his doctoral research was an investigation of the structure function relationships of transfer RNAs and their complexes.\n\nCareer\nAfter declining postdoctoral research positions with Stanley Cohen and Klaus Weber, Schoemaker chose to work as a research scientist in industry. \nHis choice was influenced by the severe disabilities suffered by his first daughter, Maureen, who was born with lissencephaly and needed specialised care. This inspired Schoemaker to become involved in commercial biotechnology.\n\nIn 1976 Schoemaker joined Corning Medical, a Boston-based division of Corning Glass Works. At Corning Schoemaker rapidly progressed from being a specialist in immunoassay development for diagnostics to heading research and development. Among his achievements at the company was devising effective diagnostic kit tests for thyroid disorders.\n\nIn 1979 Schoemaker became involved in the founding of Centocor together with a former Corning Medical colleague Ted Allen and the bioentrepreneur Michael Wall with whom he had some dealings while at Corning. Inspired by the work of Hilary Koprowski, who developed some of the earliest monoclonal antibodies against tumour antigens and influenza viral antigens, the objective of Centocor was to commercialise monoclonal antibodies for diagnostics and therapeutics. In 1980 Schoemaker joined Centocor and soon after became its first chief executive officer.\n\nFrom the start Centocor decided to fill its product pipeline through partnerships with research institutions and marketing alliances. Central to this policy was Schoemaker's ability to network and the company's decision to design diagnostic kits so that were compatible with existing diagnostic systems. Under Schoemaker's leadership Centocor rapidly grew into a profitable diagnostic business. By 1985 the company had revenues of approximately $50 million. In part this success was built upon the swift approval the company won for two of its tests. The first was for gastrointestinal cancer test and the other was for hepatitis B. Between 1983 and 1986 Centocor introduced three other diagnostic tests to the market: one for ovarian cancer (the first diagnostic test available for the disease), one for breast cancer and one for colorectal cancer.\n\nDespite the company's success on the diagnostic front, Schoemaker was plunged in 1992 into efforts to save the company from bankruptcy when its first therapeutic, Centoxin, a drug designed to treat septic shock, failed to win FDA approval. In part the crisis had come about as a result of the company's executives trying to go it alone in developing the drug. What saved the company was a return to the policy of collaboration. Learning from its mistakes with Centoxin, in December 1994 Centocor gained marketing approval for ReoPro, a monoclonal antibody drug for cardiovascular disease. The first therapeutic to ever receive simultaneous US and European approvals, and the second monoclonal antibody to ever win approval as a drug, ReoPro marked a milestone for both Centocor and for monoclonal antibodies therapeutics. ReoPro was to be followed in August 1998 by the approval of Centocor's Remicade, a drug to treat auto-immune disorders like Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nAfter selling Centocor to Johnson and Johnson in 1999, Schoemaker went on to form Neuronyx, Inc., a biotech company focused on developing cellular therapies. After Schoemaker died in 2006 the company was continued by his wife Anne Faulkner Schoemaker. Initial work focused on using stem cells taken from adult bone marrow to help regenerate heart tissue damaged during heart attacks. Later the company turned direction to looking at the development of a treatment for incision wounds in women following breast cancer reconstruction surgery. The company later changed its name to Garnet BioTherapeutics. Despite promising clinical results and raising more than $55 million in venture capital funding, the company was unable to continue.\n\nDeath\nSchoemaker was diagnosed in 1994 with a form of brain cancer, medulloblastoma. \nHe died on January 1, 2006, at age 55.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nHubert Schoemaker on WhatisBiotechnology.org\n \n \n\n1950 births\n2006 deaths\nAmerican biochemists\n20th-century American businesspeople\nDutch businesspeople\nBiotechnologists\nAmerican immunologists\nPeople from Deventer\nDutch emigrants to the United States\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology School of Science alumni\nUniversity of Notre Dame alumni\nDeaths from brain cancer in the United States\nDeaths from cancer in Pennsylvania\nDutch immunologists"}

Steward Davis", "text": "James Steward Davis (born October 11, 1890 — disappeared on April 15, 1929) was an American lawyer and political activist in Baltimore, Maryland. During the 1920s, Davis worked as a highly respected trial lawyer as well as a campaign organizer for W. Ashbie Hawkins, Al Smith, Herbert O'Conor and the Democratic Party in Maryland. In 1929, Davis disappeared under suspicious circumstances.\n\nAncestry\nDavis was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in 1890, the son of a barber. His grandmother, Matilda Stewart (Steward), is identified as living at 418 South Street, Harrisburg from 1900 until the family moved to 1511 Derry Street between 1910 and 1920. She was listed as a cook on the census records and is last reported in the household of his parents in 1920. His grandfather appears only on the 1870 census for Harrisburg as a carter born in Baltimore.\n\nEducation\nAfter his graduation from Harrisburg High School, Davis took a two-year course at Dickinson College. Then he studied law there, graduating first in his class in 1914. According to later newspaper accounts, he was the first person of color to be valedictorian at Dickinson School of Law.\n\nCareer\nDavis moved to Baltimore in 1915, and was admitted to the bar on June 19 of that year. He began practicing on his own, although he would later partner with such notable Baltimore attorneys as W. Norman Bishop, Warner T. McGuinn, and George W. Evans.\n\nSoon after beginning his law practice, Davis' career was interrupted by World War I, and he spent the next 18 months in the Army. He served in France as a sergeant. After being promoted to lieutenant, Davis became an instructor at Camp Zachary Taylor near Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nUpon returning from the war, Davis quickly built a thriving practice as a trial lawyer in Baltimore. At six feet tall, and with a polished air and winning smile, Davis had an impressive presence which sometimes drew crowds to the courtroom. In 1921, he appeared in 48 cases mentioned in The Afro-American newspaper, mostly divorces and criminal defense, including the highly publicized capital murder case of Henry Brown, an Annapolis sailor. Said Davis of his legal career, \"The law offers a most attractive (spot) for colored men. We get a fair show in the courts and the people appreciate our efforts\".\n\nThough his legal career put him in the limelight, Davis did not run for political office and instead worked behind the scenes as a campaign organizer. He was the chairman of the committee supporting W. Ashbie Hawkins's revolt against the established Republican Party in 1920. Like other independent Republicans, Davis later switched to the Democratic Party, and managed the Colored City Democratic campaign for Al Smith's 1928 bid against Herbert Hoover.\n\nDavis said of his political activism, \"It is time that we look after our own political affairs, and not entrust them to whites who are indifferent to our welfare\". Ironically, Davis supported Herbert O'Conor's (white) campaign for State's Attorney for Baltimore City in 1926. As Attorney General, O'Conor would argue against the admission of Donald Gaines Murray to the University of Maryland law school in 1935.\n\nDavis married Blanche Moore, a public school teacher, in 1920 and they had two children, Suzanne and Blanche. During the 1920s Davis was a well-respected lawyer in Baltimore who was embraced by the legal community and social circles. In April 1929, Davis vanished.\n\nDisappearance\nOn the morning of April 15, 1929, Davis left his home at 1202 Madison Avenue for his office at 217 St. Paul Place. He never arrived. His family initially concealed his absence, and The Afro American newspaper first mentioned his disappearance in mid-May. An investigation by the Monumental Bar Association found that Davis had bought a train ticket to New York City on April 15, stayed at New York's 135th St. Y.M.C.A. that night and then checked out the following morning. Nothing further was reported found.\n\nThere were many theories about his disappearance, but one persistent rumor was that Davis had misapplied money in an administration case, and fled to avoid sanction. In a September 19, 1931 story, The Afro-American reported that an executive meeting\nof the Monumental Bar Association settled the case and swore everyone to secrecy, hoping to allow Davis to return to his practice, but no corroboration surfaced for this story. There were also unsubstantiated claims of sightings in various cities in the\nUnited States or in France.\n\nSee also\nList of people who disappeared\n\nReferences\n\"Lawyer Who Vanished Years Ago Still Missing.\" Afro-American, 22 July 1935.\nMadden, Charles, J.

He attended university at Cardiff and Cambridge and taught Welsh at Aberystwyth. He wrote a number of books on Welsh history, including A History of Wales (Hanes Cymru in Welsh).\n\nEducation\nDavies was born in the Rhondda, Wales, and studied at both University College, Cardiff, and Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nLife and work\nDavies was married with four children. In later life he acknowledged that he was bisexual.  After teaching Welsh history at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, he retired to Cardiff, and appeared frequently as a presenter and contributor to history programmes on television and radio.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Davies was commissioned to write a concise history of Wales by Penguin Books to add to its Pelican series of the histories of nations. The decision by Penguin to commission the volume in Welsh was \"unexpected and highly commendable,\" wrote Davies. The Welsh version is titled Hanes Cymru, whilst the English version is titled A History of Wales.\n\n\"I seized the opportunity to write of Wales and the Welsh. When I had finished, I had a typescript which was almost three times larger than the original commission,\" wrote Davies. The original voluminous typescript was first published in hardback under the Allen Lane imprint. Davies took a sabbatical from his post at the University College of Wales and wrote most of the chapters while touring Europe. Davies dedicated Hanes Cymru to his wife, Janet Mackenzie Davies.\n\nHanes Cymru was translated into English and published in 1993, as there was \"a demand among English-speakers to read what was already available to Welsh-speakers,\" wrote Davies. A revised edition was published (in both languages) in 2007.\n\nIn 2005, Davies received the Glyndŵr Award for an Outstanding Contribution to the Arts in Wales during the Machynlleth Festival.

{"id": "4048838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballylongford", "title": "Ballylongford", "text": "Ballylongford (historically Bealalongford, from ) is a village near Listowel in northern County Kerry, Ireland.\n\nGeography\nThe village is situated near the estuary of the Ballyline River, on Ballylongford Bay, a tidal estuary of the River Shannon, close to Carrigafoyle Island and on the coast road between Tarbert and the seaside town of Ballybunion.\n\nThe farmland in the area is used primarily for dairying, which is a mainstay of the local economy.\n\nThree kilometers to the north, on Carrigafoyle Island, stands the castle and anchorage commemorated in the name of the village. For centuries, Ballylongford shared the political, military and religious fate of the castle and the nearby Franciscan Lislaughtin Abbey.\n\nHistory\n\n Carrigafoyle Castle was built between 1490 and 1500 by Conchuir Liath Uí Conchuir (Connor Liath O’Connor) using a design borrowed from the Normans. In addition to its windows and archways, it features a spiral staircase of 104 steps that visitors can climb today. The castle, now a listed National Monument, stands 100 feet (almost 30 m) high and its battlements provide views of the estuary and the monastic Scattery Island in County Clare. The O'Connors of Kerry held political sway from this strategic base which allowed them to \"inspect\" ships passing to and from the port of Limerick. Thus, \"taxation\" and smuggling were the main sources of income. The castle was fortified and the narrow spiral staircase ascends clockwise thus disadvantaging any attacker.\n\nIn 1580, during the Second Desmond Rebellion, the castle was defended by a garrison composed of some 70 Irish, Italian and Spanish troops, led by Captain Julian, an Italian. The Siege of Carrigafoyle Castle by Elizabethan forces under Lord Justice Sir William Pelham began on Palm Sunday. After two days, it was breached by cannon fire and taken, following which the surviving defenders were all hanged. The cannon breach remains visible to this day. Towards the end of the Nine Years War, taking advantage of the distraction of the English, Chieftain John O'Connor briefly re-occupied the castle only to be put out again in 1603 by George Carew, the Governor of Munster.\n\nKing James I restored the castle to the O'Connors in 1607 but in 1651 during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, it was again captured, this time by Cromwellian forces under Edmund Ludlow. Ludlow was Henry Ireton's second in command and, after Ireton's death, commander in chief in Ireland. Ludlow ensured that the castle could never again be fortified and garrisoned, by knocking the outer defensive walls.\n\nThe O'Connor lands were confiscated under the Act for the Settlement of Ireland of 1652 and given to William Sandes of Cumberland, who had arrived in Ireland with Oliver Cromwell in 1649. Following the restoration of the monarchy the lands were subsequently granted to Trinity College Dublin in 1666. The college remained the principal landlord in the Ballylongford area up to the passage of the Land Act 1903. Some land titles are still vested in the college to this day.\n\nOn the other side of the creek, the O'Connors built the Friary of Lislaughtin in 1478, known locally as Lislaughtin Abbey (Lios Laichtin, meaning Lachtin's Enclosure). St Lachtin was the first to preach Christianity in the area. Two of the O'Connor chiefs are buried within its walls. The Abbey was raided twice by English forces coinciding with the military action against Carrigafoyle Castle. The Abbey was dissolved in the 17th century. A processional cross, possibly buried by the friars for safekeeping, survived the raids and was later discovered by a farmer. This processional cross, known as Lislaughtin Cross, is now on display in the National Museum in Dublin. Today, the Abbey and its grounds serve as the town's primary Roman Catholic cemetery.\n\nThe village in its present form dates from the end of the eighteenth century, though a bridge over the ford existed long before then. The old bridge was destroyed by flood in 1926. A reinforced concrete bridge was completed in 1930 and stands to this day. Photographs taken at the turn of the century show the village to have been largely made up of thatched houses, but many of these were burned by the Black and Tans during the War of Independence.\n\nA concrete coastal artillery fort, Fort Shannon, is located six kilometers from the village. Constructed in 1940, it is the only such fortification built by the Irish Defence Forces during World War II, termed the Emergency in Ireland.\n\nEconomy and amenities\n\nFarming, fishing and tourism are key contributors to the local economy.  there were renewed proposals to open a liquefied natural gas terminal in the area.\n\nBallylongford parish is within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kerry and is served by the church of St Mary, Asdee, and the church of St Michael the Archangel, Ballylongford.
