In the days of tribal wars they fought surrounding tribes to secure a large portion of land. Their military strength in those days enabled them to wipe out the entire tribe of Gbaylo. The land previously occupied by the Gbaylo tribe is currently a property of the Barrobo people. To control their warlike nature, President Edwin Barclay of Liberia built a military barak among them. The soldiers  of Camp King used suppression, hard labor and intimidation to keep them in check.  Besides, they were subjected to smaller tribes in the administrative arrangement of the Liberian central government. First, they were part of the Webbo district. When Grand Gedeh county was established and Webbo became part of Grand Gedeh, the Barrobo tribe was subjected to the smaller tribe of Boah. The most prominent paramount chiefs during the chieftaincy period were Peter Brooks of Feloken and Sunday Karmanue of Rock Town.

A European legal scholar, he served briefly in the government of Greece as Minister of the Interior in 1989 and again in 1996. He is professor at the Law School of the Aristotle University and at Bucerius Law School in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nEarly years and education\nSkouris was born on 6 March 1948 in Thessaloniki, Greece.\n\nHe graduated with a degree in law from the Free University of Berlin in 1970, and was subsequently awarded doctorate in constitutional and administrative law at the University of Hamburg in 1973. In 1978 he was a professor of Public Law at Bielefeld University and in 1982 a professor of Public Law at the University of Thessaloniki. During the period of 1972 to 1977 he was lecturing law at the University of Hamburg.\n\nGreek Minister of the Interior\nFollowing the dissolution of the Greek parliament in 1989, Skouris served as the Minister of the Interior briefly during the caretaker government. He served another short stint in 1996.\n\nNotable positions\nSkouris was the President of the Greek Association for European Law between 1992 and 1994, Director of the Centre for International and European Economic Law in 1997, and President of the Greek Economic and Social Council in 1998. He has also served as a Member of the Scientific Committee of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs between 1997 and 1999, Administrative Board of the Greek National Judges' College between 1995 and 1996, Greek National Research Committee between 1993 and 1995, Higher Selection Board for Greek Civil Servants between 1994 and 1996, and the Academic Council of the Academy of European Law in 1995. He was a member of the Board of Guardians of the Academy of European Law of Trier.\n\nSince 10 May 2017 he has been the second chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee, succeeding the German Hans-Joachim Eckert.\n\nEuropean Court of Justice\n\nOn 8 June 1999, the member states of the European Union agreed to the appointment of Skouris to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, or European Court of Justice. Following his first term, the justices of the court elected him as their President on 7 October 2003, and again on 7 October 2009. Koen Lenaerts, who had been Vice-President since 2012, succeeded him as President on 8 October 2015.\n\nLandmark rulings\nPresident Skouris has presided over several landmark rulings since joining the court, including B.F. Cadman v. Health & Safety Executive (C-17/05), decided in 2006, which held that pay scales based on seniority were not gender discrimination, unless it could be proved otherwise that seniority was not the discriminatory factor. Other notable cases include Brian Francis Collins v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (C-138/02), decided in 2004, which struck down a discriminatory employment benefits law in the United Kingdom, allowing access to benefits for those of an EU nationality, and Commission of the European Communities v. Federal Republic of Germany C-112/05 which struck down the \"Volkswagen Law\", against the wishes of the German government and labor unions. In \"The Viking Case\", International Transport Workers' Federation, Finnish Seamen's Union v. Viking Line ABP, OÜ Viking Line Eesti (C-438/05), decided in 2007, it was determined that an employer who seeks cost-effective labor in a member state cannot have business freedom privileges infringed by trade unions unless the aim of the union is to protect workers in accordance with the public interest.\n\nAnother notable case includes Coleman v Attridge Law, in which the court ruled that a mother whose job was terminated for requesting specific hours because of having to care for a disabled child was entitled to protection from disability discrimination. It struck down a United Kingdom law that only permitted protection for the actual individual who was disabled.\nAs a significant result of the ECJ intervention, associative discrimination became a part of the UK Equality Act 2010.\n\nControversies\nIn 2009, the court rendered a landmark decision in Apostolides v Orams, which forced the owner of a vacation villa from the United Kingdom to vacate their property rights for victims of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, who had fled and lost their land. The neutrality of President Skouris was questioned because of his acceptance of the Grand Collar of the Order of Makarios III of the Republic of Cyprus in 2006 and visits with the leadership of the southern portion of the island, where many refugees remain, months before the ruling.\n\nSpeeches and views\nIn a speech in 2004, President Skouris indicated he believed that the Court of Justice served as a supreme court instead of just a constitutional court.\n\nIn a speech in 2006 at the European Conference on Subsidiarity, he described the role of the subsidiarity principle with the court, linking it to Quadragesimo anno. He stated \"what individuals can do on their own initiative and out of their own efforts, should not be taken away from them and allocated to the community, for it would be against justice for the larger entities to assume what the small entities can achieve and bring to a positive end... Subsidiarity protects small communities against being deprived of tasks by a central power to a greater extent as necessary.” He also discussed proportionality, which he says \"protects individuals against a restriction to an unnecessary extent of their rights by a measure benefiting the community.\"\n\nIn 2007, he visited the Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law in Dallas, along with justices from the United States Supreme Court, and attended events at the Dallas Bar Association and the Dallas Committee on Foreign Relations, while delivering a speech on the role of the Court of Justice in the EU to the pro-business Greater Dallas Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAt the 50th anniversary celebration for the court in 2009, President Skouris spoke about the court's earlier years of abstaining from issues of individual fundamental rights within each country but, with the new Charter of Fundamental Rights, expressed a desire, in accordance with such, to improve the rights of citizens within member nations.\n\nHonours and awards\n\nHe has Honorable distinctions by the Greek, Italian, Cypriot, Romanian, Austrian, and French governments. He has a Rank of Commander in National Order of the Legion of Honor of the French Republic. He is a Corresponding member of Ακαδημία Αθηνών (Academy of Athens). He is an honorary doctorate of: the Administrative College of Speyer (Germany), the University of Vilnius (Lithuania), the Democritus University of Thrace, the University of Münster (Germany),the University of Athens and the University of Bucarest, University Paris 2 Panthéon-Assas, the University of Masaryk (Brno), Panteion University (Athens) and Heidelberg University.\n\nSee also\n\nList of members of the European Court of Justice\n\nReferences\n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1948 births\n20th-century Greek lawyers\nLiving people\nMinisters of the Interior of Greece\nPresidents of the European Court of Justice\nGrand Crosses of the Order of the Star of Romania\nGreek judges of international courts and tribunals\n21st-century Greek judges\nPoliticians from Thessaloniki"}

{"id": "4103460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gare%20de%20Lyon%20rail%20accident", "title": "Gare de Lyon rail accident", "text": "The Gare de Lyon rail accident occurred on 27 June 1988, when an SNCF commuter train headed inbound to Paris's Gare de Lyon terminal crashed into a stationary outbound train, killing 56 and injuring 60, resulting in the third deadliest rail disaster in peacetime France.\n\nOverview \nOn 27 June 1988, SNCF commuter train 153944 inbound to Paris' Gare de Lyon terminal from Melun to the southeast was running its routine 80 km journey, using one of SNCF's electric multiple units, Class Z 5300. As the train neared Paris, it passed the Le Vert de Maisons station, which was usually a stop on the route. However, SNCF had recently implemented a new summer timetable, which meant train 153944 no longer stopped at the station.\n\nAs the train pulled past the platform, a passenger in the second car of the train suddenly stood, pulled the emergency brake, and left the train. Driver Daniel Saulin, assisted by Guard Jean Charles Bovée, after working for 26 minutes, reset the brakes and continued. This procedure had taken longer than usual, prompting more passengers to leave the train. To make up the lost time, the station controller at Gare de Lyon, André Tollance, instructed Saulin to skip the next scheduled stop (and the last before the terminal), Maisons-Alfort.\n\nAfter the train passed Maisons-Alfort, it reached a 4% grade that led to Gare de Lyon. When Saulin passed a yellow signal instructing him to slow the train in preparation for being switched to an empty platform, Saulin discovered his brakes barely worked. As the train picked up speed from its descent, Saulin desperately radioed an emergency warning, but failed to identify himself to the controller. He pressed the general alarm button on his radio and left his cab to evacuate the passengers to the rear of the train.\n\nTrain 153944 crashed into a delayed outbound train as its passengers were evacuating, heeding warnings made by the delayed train's driver, André Tanguy, who bravely remained in his cab at the time, repeating a warning over the intercom numerous times until he was killed in the collision.\n\nInvestigation \n\nInitial thoughts were that the collision was the result of a terrorist act, due to a recent string of bombings of French trains in and around Paris. This theory was supported by the fact that investigators who were examining the wrecked shell of train 153944 found the main brake pipe valve, located behind the first car, closed. When open, this valve allows compressed air generated in the first car to travel back through the other cars to power the compressed air brakes. When closed, the brakes on all cars behind the valve are disabled. Despite the signs of possible terrorism, the investigators believed that only someone with detailed knowledge of the braking system's workings could have closed the valve.\n\nNext, whoever pulled the emergency brake was scrutinized, though the person was unknown. When a newspaper printed an advertisement asking for the brake-puller to come forward, a young mother, Odile Mirroir, came forward. She told investigators that she normally used train 153944's stop at the Le Vert de Maisons station to pick up her children from school. However, she was unaware that the new summer timetable meant that her train would not stop at Le Vert de Maisons. So not wanting to keep her children waiting, she pulled the emergency brake and left the train. She was fined 1,000 francs for her action.\n\nThe investigators then turned to an older interview with Saulin and looked at the record more closely than before. After the brake was pulled, Saulin went to the rear of the first car to pull the reset handle, but the handle was sluggish and refused to move. Having been overlooked previously, it was discovered that Saulin had placed his hand on the main brake pipe valve to get more leverage to pull the reset handle. When Saulin finally pulled the handle, the investigators surmise, he must have also accidentally closed the valve.\n\nHowever, this conclusion raised another question as to how Saulin managed to get the train moving again. A fail-safe mechanism on the cars locks the brakes in the on position if the valve is closed. The only way to start the train again is to re-open the valve or manually unlock each brake pad. SNCF policy requires to call for an engineer to examine the train (who would have probably found the closed valve). However, Saulin, anxious to continue the trip, enlisted the help of Bovée to work along opposite sides of the train unlocking each brake. Saulin believed the cause of the problem to be a common condition known as an \"air lock\". When the emergency brake is activated, an \"air lock\" is the result of the compressed air filling up the brake pipes, clogging them and preventing the brakes from working. The brake pads lock as part of the fail-safe mechanism when an air lock occurs. To fix this problem, the trapped air must be bled out of the pipe to release the brakes. So with the assistance of Bovee, he went and manually bled what little air was left out of each brake of the carriages. Nevertheless, Saulin had no idea of what he had done, and stated that the pressure gauge in his cab was marking the correct measure, which is why he thought all the braking systems were in working order. Unbeknownst to him, he had closed the main valve, isolating the front carriage from the rest of the train. He had freed the brakes, but had overridden a failsafe mechanism: and with the valve closed, there was no way for new air to come in and replenish the system. Thus the gauge only showed the pressure of the first carriage's brakes.\n\nEven with only one-eighth of the required braking power, there were still opportunities to stop or slow the train. First, there was one more station (Maisons-Alfort), before Gare de Lyon, which would have given the driver plenty of time to slow down or stop the train. However, to avoid throwing other trains at the Gare De Lyon station off schedule, the controllers ordered the driver to pass through Maisons-Alfort and proceed directly to Gare de Lyon. Second, the train was equipped with an additional electric (dynamic) braking system, but according to Saulin, drivers avoided using the dynamic brakes because they were unreliable and had a tendency to skid the wheels when used in conjunction with the air brakes. In any case, Saulin probably had completely forgotten about it as a result of his panic.\n\nEven at this stage, there were still two more opportunities to get the train to stop. Driver Saulin messaged a warning and activated an emergency alarm to signal that his train was in trouble, but he neglected to identify himself or his position to the controllers, and left his cab before anyone could call him back. The controllers knew that the runaway train was one of four trains due to arrive at the station, and they attempted to message all of them to narrow down the possibilities. If they could rule out which trains were not in trouble, they would have been able to identify the train that was in trouble, and get it diverted to Platform 1. However, when Saulin pushed the emergency alarm, it forced all trains on the network to stop wherever they were and wait for instructions. A resulting stream of calls from waylaid drivers inquiring about the stoppage clogged the communication lines between the control room and the trains. As a result, the controllers were never able to identify the runaway train.\n\nFinally, the signallers had also pre-programmed the tracks so that the runaway train would be diverted into Platform 1, which was empty, instead of Platform 2 where the delayed train was. Crashing into an empty platform might have wrecked the train, but with the passengers evacuated into the eighth carriage, casualties would have been avoided. But when Daniel Saulin activated the alarm, the signallers had to turn all signals to red in a process called the \"General Closure procedure\". This stopped all trains along the lines heading in and out of Gare de Lyon. However, in order to give the signallers full manual control of the entire network, this procedure disabled all pre-programming of routes and allowed the runaway train to go into Platform 2 instead of Platform 1. At this point, the collision was unavoidable.\n\nAftermath \nThe driver, Daniel Saulin, was released after serving six months of a four-year manslaughter sentence. Legal proceedings were begun against the Gare de Lyon supervisor, Auguste-Andre Tholence, who failed to evacuate the station, and Mirroir, but were unsuccessful.\n\nSNCF union representatives claimed Saulin was scapegoated; critics of the SNCF blamed the accident on overly tight scheduling, lack of adequate station space and railway mismanagement.\n\nMedia coverage \nThe accident was featured on season 2 of the National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster in the program Paris Train Crash (also known as Runaway Train).\n\nSee also \n Lists of rail accidents\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \"France: Runaway Train\".

{"id": "4103466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87aykara", "title": "Çaykara", "text": "Çaykara (Romeika: Kadahor, Κατωχώρι) is a municipality and district of Trabzon Province, Turkey. Its area is 574 km2, and its population is 13,070 (2022). As of 2023, the Mayor of Çaykara is Hanefi Tok (AKP). Çaykara village lies in a V-shaped valley along the Solaklı River in the Pontic Mountains, at an elevation of around 300 metres. Çaykara district lies to the south of Dernekpazarı (Kondu) and forms the upper part of the Of-valley system ('Solaklı Vadisi' in Turkish), with peaks reaching to over 3300 meters. The western half of İkizdere district - which lies just east of Çaykara and is now part of Rize province - was historically also part of the same administrative and cultural region. Large swathes of the district are made up of  old-growth temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, gradually making way for alpine tundra at higher altitudes.\n\nEtymology\nThe district takes its name from the Çaykara stream, which forms through the conjunction of the Solaklı and Yeşilalan brooks. The historic name of Çaykara is Kadahor or Katokhôr (from Kato Choriou \"lower village\" in Pontic Greek). As is typical in transhumance communities in the Pontic Mountains and the Caucasus, Kadahor was settled with a number of subordinate upland villages for different seasons, which explains its name. However, in current times the name 'Tsaikara' (Τσαϊκάρα) is also used in Pontic Greek.\n\nHistory\n\nCurrent Çaykara district covers the upper parts of the 'Ophis' ('Solaklı' in modern Turkish) river valley, and its tributaries. The river Ophis and a homonymous Greek settlement at its mouth were first mentioned in antiquity by Arrian. A path besides the river functioned as a trade route connecting the coast with eastern Anatolia, through 'Paipert' (current Bayburt). In the Middle Ages, the administrative region (or Bandon) to which the area of Çaykara belonged was known as Stylos. It lay between the bandon of Sourmena and Rhizaion. Settlement of the higher parts of the valley is first attested in the middle-ages, when it was part of the Byzantine Empire. The history of individual villages and towns in the district going back to antiquity is unknown. This may be due to the frequent landslides that occur there, and the limited archeological research which has been conducted. A few place names hint at a possible Chaldian presence in the valley before it was Hellenized, such as the Haldizen (Χάλντιζεν) stream in the southeast of the district and the village 'Halt' (Χάλτ, or Söğütlü in Turkish), downstream in Of-district. It is assumed that Kadahor was one of the original settlements in the area, which may explain its name and function as the central market-town of the upper valley.\n\nAccording to local oral histories, the valley functioned as an alternative trading route during the late medieval period connecting Trabzon - through the coastal town of Of - to Persia and beyond. At that time the valley was part of the Empire of Trebizond. On a hill overlooking Çaykara town, just west of the village  (Zeleka), lies a ruined fortress which according to locals was constructed by Genoese traders. The Genoese also held the fortress town of Bayburt - south of Çaykara - which could be reached by the mountain pass near Sakarsu (modern Şekersu). Çaykara entered Ottoman rule in 1461, following the Ottoman conquest of the Empire of Trebizond by Sultan Mehmed II. According to Greek historiographers the valleys attracted residents of coastal cities who sought refuge from Ottoman taxation. While the population of the valley at that time was mostly made up of Greek-speaking Christians, the locals did have interactions with nomadic Turkish tribes on the summer pastures.\n\nAccording to the Ottoman tax books (tahrir defterleri) of 1486, there were 1277 people living in the historic villages that were located within the present-day Çaykara district (namely the villages of Ğorğoras (in Greek: Γοργορά), Holayisa, Paçan and Zeno (in Greek: Ξένος), where there were 235 houses (1 of them inhabited by Muslims, 234 of them by Christians.)\nDuring the Ottoman period the valley also housed a small number of Armenians, who had settled there in the villages Fotinos and Harhes after they had been attacked and chased-off from neighboring valleys by a clan leader called İslamoğlu Bey.\n\nAccording to the Ottoman tax books (tahrir defterleri) of 1681, the inhabitants of the villages of Ğorğoras, Holayisa, Paçan, Zeno, Yente, Haldizen, İpsil (in Greek: Υψηλή), Okene, Sero (Siros), Kadahor, Hopşera, Sarahos (in Greek: Σαχάρω), Fotinos (in Greek: Φωτεινός) and Zeleka had been fully converted to Islam. In 1681, there were 2100 people living in 380 houses, all of them Muslims. The villages in the valley had a well developed educational system; In the late Ottoman period the uplands of Çaykara housed dozens of seminaries, attracting students from across Anatolia. As a result, the region had one of the highest literacy rates in the empire, and many of the inhabitants of the valley registered surnames in the 19th century - well before other Muslim groups in Anatolia. This history of literacy is reflected in the many scientists, politicians, musicians, directors, etc. that came from the sparsely populated villages in the district. At times the valley also attracted small groups of settlers or refugees from other parts of the empire, such as Arabs from Maraş and Circassians from the Caucasus.\n\nIn 1915, during the Caucasus Campaign of World War I, Ottoman forces and local guerrillas fought the invading Russian army at the Sultan Murat Plateau ( ), a high plateau  southwest of Çaykara's town center. A monumental cemetery for the fallen Ottoman soldiers, named Şehitler Tepesi (Hill of Martyrs) is located there. The Russian army constructed a new road through the valley, connecting it to the Anatolian plateau south of the Pontic Mountains. The road was meant to function as an alternative supply route for the Russian forces in eastern Anatolia, as they were unable to hold the Zigana Pass south of Trabzon. Part of the road is still in use as the D915, which is recognized as one of the most dangerous roads in the world  due to its many hairpins without guard rails.\n\nBecause of their Islamic identity, the inhabitants of Kadahor/Çaykara were not deported during the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. A few dozen families from the valley that had retained their Christian beliefs chose to resettle in Macedonia, Greece, in the village of Nea Trapezounta (New Trabzon). Many families across the valley retain some contact with relatives in Greece.\n\nUntil 1925, Çaykara was a village bound to the Of district within Trabzon Province. In 1925, it became a bucak (subdistrict), and on 1 June 1947 it became an ilçe (district) of Trabzon Province. During the first half of the 20th century the mother tongue of the residents of the district remained the local Of-dialect of Pontic Greek (colloquially called 'Romeyka', or 'Rumca' in Turkish). Up until the first decade of the 21st century there were many elderly women who were monolingual in Romeyka. All of the permanently settled villages in the district were officially renamed in the 1960s. However, except for Çaykara and Uzungöl - which are the places where the community interacts with the state - these new Turkish names have not caught on. Local toponyms of Greek, Chaldian and Armenian origin such as the names of seasonal settlements, streams, hills and mountains remain in use. Only in the second half of the 20th century did the prevalence of 'Romeyka' start to dwindle among the younger generations.\n\nThrough a series of state-sponsored programs from the 1940s to the 1970s thousands of residents of Çaykara villages were offered resettlement in other parts of the Turkish Republic and Cyprus. Çaykarali's were settled in Van's Özalp district on the Iranian border (in the village of 'Emek'), in the city Kırıkhan on the Syrian border, in the villages Davlos, Flamoudi and Trikomo in Northern Cyprus, and in Muş province. There is also a settlement of people from Çaykara on the island Imbros, adjacent the Greek village Dereköy. These resettlements and subsequent migrations within and outside Turkey resulted in a stark decline of the population of the district - from around 40.000 people to just above 12.000. While some migrants were able to retain the use of Romeyka due to geographic isolation (those in Van) or contact with local Greek populations (those on Imbros and Cyprus), the use of the language in Çaykara district itself declined. It remains unclear if the linguistic background of the villages was a reason for the government-initiated programmes.\n\nComposition\nThere are 32 neighbourhoods in Çaykara District:\n\n Akdoğan\n Arpaözü\n Aşağıkumlu\n Ataköy\n Baltacılı\n Çambaşı\n Çamlıbel\n Çayıroba\n Demirkapı\n Demirli\n Derindere\n Eğridere\n Işıklı\n Kabataş\n Karaçam\n Kayran\n Köknar\n Koldere\n Köseli\n Maraşlı\n Şahinkaya\n Şekersu\n Soğanlı\n Taşkıran\n Taşlıgedik\n Taşören\n Ulucami\n Uzungöl\n Uzuntarla\n Yaylaönü\n Yeşilalan\n Yukarıkumlu\n\nCulture\n\nLanguage\nThe mother tongue of most inhabitants of the district above the age of 50 is the Of-dialect of Pontic Greek, Romeyka (i.e. 'language of the Romans'), which has been described as the living language closest to Ancient Greek. Due to the community's isolation the dialect retained many archaisms. The language is not taught outside the home, and for a long time it was discouraged to speak it at school. Still, some of the younger generation continue to speak the language, and many have at least a basic understanding of it. The Turkish Latin alphabet is used for communication on online platforms. There are about two dozen Grecophone villages in the district, making it the largest concentration of Greek speakers in the Turkish Republic. While locals generally don't like being addressed as Greek, they are proud of their linguistic heritage, which they use to communicate with Greek-speaking tourists. Inhabitants from Of and Çaykara also settled villages in neighboring Sürmene and Köprübaşı districts, a little further to the west. Thus there are also some pockets of Çaykara/Of-dialect Greek speaking villages in these other parts of Trabzon province. That the Of-dialect of Pontic Greek remained so virulent in this area is partly due to the fact that local imams educated and preached in this language until the second part of the 20th century. Many folk singers from the district have recorded songs in Romeyka. Native of Çaykara Vahit Tursun published a Turkish-Romeyka dictionary in 2019. Most residents of the district are also fluent in Turkish. The most popular musical instruments in the district are the kaval flute, and the kemençe violin.\n\nTranshumance\nMany of the permanent residents of the district still live a life of transhumance, migrating with their cattle between two or three different settlements belonging to the same village; An agricultural settlement near the bottom of the valley, a logging village halfway up the mountain, and a hamlet on the summer grazing land above the tree line ('parharia' or 'yayla'). Most chalets on the yayla have their own dry stone-enclosed private field, but also share a larger enclosed meadow. The spatial structure and the ratio of public to private space differs widely between the yayla's, while there are some recurring patterns. Some of the hamlets have a strong egalitarian and communal structure, with all houses having just a small private garden of approximately the same size. In a few cases there are no private gardens at all. Other hamlets are made up of multiple generational kinship clusters, with each generation adding increasingly larger fields to their cluster. There are, however, also yayla's with a more individualistic spatial organisation. Cows roam freely on the yayla, seeking out the best alpine flowers. During the summer months herders guide their sheep through the mountains. On Tuesdays villagers head down to the local market at Çaykara town. In some villages the 'old new year' of the Julian calendar is celebrated on January 14 (called 'Kalandar'). Villagers dressed as folk characters go door to door making jokes and collecting food or supplies for a shared meal or other communal activity.\n\nTourism\nIn recent years the valley has become a major tourist attraction. During the summer months Lake Uzungöl attracts thousands of tourists on a daily basis. Especially in the vicinity of the lake dozens of small and medium-sized hotels have been built - often without a permit - leading to conflict with authorities. In 2019 the eclectic Uzungöl Dursun Ali İnan Museum was opened just east of the lake, showcasing objects relating to the history, culture, nature and geography of the district, as well as a large collection of tree root and trunk art. According to some researchers the state has used tourism as an instrument to subvert local culture through the 'festivalisation' of the celebrations related to the agricultural calendar and the transhumance landscapes.\n\nVillages\nWithin Çaykara district there are about 30 villages which are more or less permanently settled. These villages are listed north to south, with their Turkish and Greek names. In most cases these villages also have or share a distinct logging settlement, a lower communal pasture (called a 'kom' in Romeyka, 'mezire' in Turkish), and a hamlet on the high summer pasture ('parharia' or 'megalo kampos' in Romeyka, 'yayla' in Turkish). These smaller seasonally occupied places are not listed here.\n\nYaylas\n\nIn the upper parts of Çaykara district there are six distinct yaylas (summer pastures), each with multiple hamlets. The most famous one of these is Sultan Murat Yaylası, which is shared by the hamlets Sıcakoba, Hanırmak, Şahinkaya, Eğrisu, Vartan and Cerah.\n\nNotable residents\n Cevdet Sunay (1899), Fifth president of Turkey\n Behram Kurşunoğlu (1922), physicist\n Yeşim Ustaoğlu (1960), architect and film director\n Sebahattin Öztürk (1962) Bureaucrat, governor\n Eyüp Aşık (1953) politician, ex-parliamenter\n Mehmet Kara (1939) politician, ex-soldier\n\nSee also\n Trabzon\n Uzungöl\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Michael Meeker, A Nation of Empire: The Ottoman Legacy of Turkish Modernity, 2002\n Margarita Poutouridou, The Of valley and the coming of Islam: the case of the Greek-speaking Muslims, 1997\n Erol Sağlam, Constitutive Ambiguities: Subjectivities and Memory in the Case of Romeika-Speaking Communities of Trabzon, Turkey, 2017\n Sitaridou, I.

{"id": "4103495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear%20gene", "title": "Nuclear gene", "text": "A nuclear gene is a gene whose physical DNA nucleotide sequence is located in the cell nucleus of a eukaryote. The term is used to distinguish nuclear genes from genes found in mitochondria or chloroplasts. The vast majority of genes in eukaryotes are nuclear.\n\nEndosymbiotic theory \nMitochondria and plastids evolved from free-living prokaryotes into current cytoplasmic organelles through endosymbiotic evolution. Mitochondria are thought to be necessary for eukaryotic life to exist. They are known as the cell's powerhouses because they provide the majority of the energy or ATP required by the cell. The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is replicated separately from the host genome. Human mtDNA codes for 13 proteins, most of which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The nuclear genome encodes the remaining mitochondrial proteins, which are then transported into the mitochondria. The genomes of these organelles have become far smaller than those of their free-living predecessors. This is mostly due to the widespread transfer of genes from prokaryote progenitors to the nuclear genome, followed by their elimination from organelle genomes. In evolutionary timescales, the continuous entry of organelle DNA into the nucleus has provided novel nuclear genes.\n\nEndosymbiotic organelle interactions \nThough separated from one another within the cell, nuclear genes and those of mitochondria and chloroplasts can affect each other in a number of ways. Nuclear genes play major roles in the expression of chloroplast genes and mitochondrial genes. Additionally, gene products of mitochondria can themselves affect the expression of genes within the cell nucleus. This can be done through metabolites as well as through certain peptides trans-locating from the mitochondria to the nucleus, where they can then affect gene expression.\n\nStructure \nEukaryotic genomes have distinct higher-order chromatin structures that are closely packaged functional relates to gene expression. Chromatin compresses the genome to fit into the cell nucleus, while still ensuring that the gene can be accessed when needed, such as during gene transcription, replication, and DNA repair.  The entirety of genome function is based on the underlying relationship between nuclear organization and the mechanisms involved in genome organization, in which there are a number of complex mechanisms and biochemical pathways which can affect the expression of individual genes within the genome. The remaining mitochondrial proteins, metabolic enzymes, DNA and RNA polymerases, ribosomal proteins, and mtDNA regulatory factors are all encoded by nuclear genes. Because nuclear genes constitute the genetic foundation of all eukaryotic organisms, anything that might change their genetic expression has a direct impact on the organism's cellular genotypes and phenotypes. The nucleus also contains a number of distinct subnuclear foci known as nuclear bodies, which are dynamically controlled structures that help numerous nuclear processes run more efficiently. Active genes, for instance, might migrate from chromosomal regions and concentrate into subnuclear foci known as transcription factories.\n\nProtein synthesis \nThe majority of proteins in a cell are the product of messenger RNA transcribed from nuclear genes, including most of the proteins of the organelles, which are produced in the cytoplasm like all nuclear gene products and then transported to the organelle. Genes in the nucleus are arranged in a linear fashion upon chromosomes, which serve as the scaffold for replication and the regulation of gene expression. As such, they are usually under strict copy-number control, and replicate a single time per cell cycle. Nuclear cells such as platelets do not possess nuclear DNA and therefore must have alternative sources for the RNA that they need to generate proteins. With the nuclear genome's 3.3 billion DNA base pairs in humans, one good example of a nuclear gene is MDH1 or the malate dehydrogenase 1 gene. In various metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle, MDH1 is a protein-coding gene that encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the NAD/NADH-dependent, reversible oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate. This gene codes for the cytosolic isozyme, which is involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle, which allows malate to cross past the mitochondrial membrane and be converted to oxaloacetate to perform further cellular functions. This gene among many exhibits its huge purposeful role in the entirety of an organism’s physiologic function. Although non-nuclear genes may exist in its functional nature, the role of nuclear genes in response and in coordination with non-nuclear genes is fundamental.\n\nSignificance \nMany nuclear-derived transcription factors have played a role in respiratory chain expression. These factors may have also contributed to the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Nuclear respiratory factor (NRF-1) fuses to respiratory encoding genes proteins, to the rate-limiting enzyme in biosynthesis, and to elements of replication and transcription of mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA. The second nuclear respiratory factor (NRF-2) is necessary for the production of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) and Vb (COXVb) to be maximized.\n\nThe studying of gene sequences for the purpose of speciation and determining genetic similarity is just one of the many uses of modern day genetics, and the role that both types of genes have in that process is important. Though both nuclear genes and those within endosymbiotic organelles provide the genetic makeup of an organism, there are distinct features that can be better observed when looking at one compared to the other. Mitochondrial DNA is useful in the study of speciation as it tends to be the first to evolve in the development of a new species, which is different from nuclear genes' chromosomes that can be examined and analyzed individually, each giving its own potential answer as to the speciation of a relatively recently evolved organism.\n\nAs nuclear genes are the genetic basis of all eukaryotic organisms, anything that can affect their expression therefore directly affects characteristics about that organism on a cellular level. The interactions between the genes of endosymbiotic organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts are just a few of the many factors that can act on the nuclear genome.\n\nReferences \n\nGenes\nMolecular biology"}

{"id": "4103514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand%20Lodge%20of%20Pennsylvania", "title": "Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania", "text": "The Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, officially  The Right Worshipful Grand Lodge of the Most Ancient and Honorable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons of Pennsylvania and Masonic Jurisdictions Thereunto Belonging, sometimes referred to as Freemasons of Pennsylvania is the premier masonic organization in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Grand Lodge claims to be the oldest in the United States, and the third oldest in the world after England (est. 1717) and Ireland (est. 1725), having been originally established as the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania in 1731. This claim is disputed by both the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts and the Grand Lodge of Virginia.\n\nToday, the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania is the largest Masonic Jurisdiction in the United States, claiming more than 80,000 members at the end of 2021. There are more Freemasons in Pennsylvania than any other State.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania\n\nTwo English grand lodges erected lodges in Pennsylvania during the 18th century, the Premier Grand Lodge of England (known as the \"Moderns\"), established in London in 1717, and the Ancient Grand Lodge of England (known as the \"Antients\" or \"Ancients\"), established in London in 1751. The first of these, the Moderns' Grand Lodge, was first to establish lodges and provincial grand lodges in the American colonies. But by 1785, the Moderns and their lodges had ceased to exist in Pennsylvania, the last of their members having been absorbed by the lodges of the Ancients. The present day Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania descends primarily from the Ancients, with the Moderns having been grafted onto \"Ancient York Masonry.\"\n\nThe Tun Tavern Lodge\nThe earliest minute book of any Masonic lodge on the North American continent is that for Tun Tavern Lodge No. 3 (of the Moderns) in Philadelphia. The Tun Tavern was the first \"brew house\" in the city, being built in 1685, and was located on the waterfront at the corner of Water Street and Tun Alley. The extant records of the Lodge begin on 24 June 1731, but the lodge may have been older than that. It was reported by Benjamin Franklin, in his Gazette for 8 December 1730, that there were \"several Lodges of Free Masons erected in this Province....\" The Tun Tavern, being a popular meeting place in Philadelphia, was undoubtedly the first location of a lodge in Philadelphia. Other organizations were formed there, including the St. George's Society in 1720, and the St. Andrew's Society in 1747. Even the United States Marine Corps was founded there on 10 November 1775 by Samuel Nicholas, grandson of a member of the Tun Tavern Lodge. According to Henry Coil, a Freemason from Massachusetts, the Tun Tavern Lodge was never warranted nor issued a charter, being an \"immemorial rights lodge.\" However, the Librarian of the Masonic Library in Philadelphia believes that, simply because there is no existing evidence, there is no reason to assume that the Tun Tavern Lodge was never warranted since all of the other Lodges at the time had been, and that it must have been warranted prior to 1749 since the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania has in its archives the minute books for the Tun Tavern Lodge from 1749-1755.\n\nThe First Provincial Grand Master\nThe first official act of the Moderns' Grand Lodge regarding the American colonies was the creation of a Provincial Grand Master for New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, naming one Daniel Coxe, Esq., to that office. This deputation, issued on 5 June 1730, was made by the Grand Master, the Duke of Norfolk, and was to remain in effect for two years from 24 June 1731 to 24 June 1733, at which time, according to the deputation, the members were empowered to elect a Provincial Grand Master. From a letter in the possession of the New York Historical Society dated 31 July 1730 at Trenton we know that Daniel Coxe was already in the colonies. Coxe returned to England to attend a meeting of the Grand Lodge in London on 29 January 1731 where he was toasted as the Provincial Grand Master \"of North America.\" Coxe eventually relocated in Burlington, New Jersey, about 20 miles from Philadelphia, where he had been awarded a colonial judgeship.\n\nThere are no explicit records to show that Daniel Coxe ever organized a Provincial Grand Lodge, nor to have erected any lodges, nor ever exercised his authority in any way as Provincial Grand Master prior to his death on 25 April 1739. In fact, his death, which was reported in the Pennsylvania Gazette by Benjamin Franklin, a member of The Tun Tavern Lodge in Philadelphia, does not even mention that Coxe was a Freemason, possibly indicating that Franklin and the other members of the Craft in Philadelphia were unaware of his affiliation. However, the Masonic historian Dr. Wilhelm Begeman points out that, \"those who deny Coxe's activity must naturally assume the Provincial Grand Lodge established itself through its own power, which is much less probable than the legal action of Coxe... that his home was in Trenton, was no serious obstacle, for the London Grand Masters nearly all lived at a distance from London, Lord Kingston, for instance, in Ireland.\" An entry in \"Liber B,\" the oldest known record of a lodge in the Americas (the second record book of St. John's Lodge, Philadelphia, from 1731 to 1738), lists William Allen as Grand Master on 24 June 1731. Coxe's deputation clearly allows for the election of a successor in perpetuity.\n\nProvincial Grand Masters of Pennsylvania\nAfter his election in 1731, William Allen appointed William Pringle, Deputy Grand Master, and Thomas Boude and Benjamin Franklin, Wardens. Benjamin Franklin would become Provincial Grand Master in 1734—the same year he published Anderson's Constitutions, the first Masonic book printed in America—and again in 1749. The organization of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania was recorded in both \"Liber B\" and the Pennsylvania Gazette, which published the names of the sixteen Grand Masters who served from 1731 to 1755. William Allen was Provincial Grand Master eight times. No reports were sent from the Provincial Grand Lodge of Moderns to the Grand Lodge of England, nor were any requested; being independent it apparently had no need to do so.  Yet, the Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania affiliated itself with the Grand Lodge of England in that it approved and adopted those Ritual changes made by the GLE after 1730.\n\nProvincial Grand Masters at Boston\nOn 30 April 1733, Henry Price of Boston was appointed Provincial Grand Master \"of New England\" by the Viscount Montagu, Grand Master of the Moderns' Grand Lodge in London. Clearly, this appointment would not have included Pennsylvania, except for Price's repeated, but disputed, claims that the Grand Master had \"ordered him to extend Freemasonry over all North America.\" Price held this office until December 1736, when he was succeeded by Robert Tomlinson, also of Boston, who held the office until his death in 1740. Tomlinson was succeeded by Thomas Oxnard, who was deputized Provincial Grand Master \"for North America\" on 23 Sept. 1743. He remained in office until his death in 1754. Whether Price's office gave him jurisdiction over Pennsylvania Masonry has always been disputed, but the question, according to those who favor the supremacy of Massachusetts, became a moot point for a brief period with Oxnard's appointment over all of North America. Historians who argue in favor of Massachuestts' primacy over Pennsylvania also point to an appointment of Benjamin Franklin as Provincial Grand Master for Pennsylvania on 10 July 1749. They argue that Provincial Grand Masters had no authority to appoint other Provincial Grand Masters and Franklin's appointment was void since only grand lodges had authority to do so. However, Daniel Coxe's deputation from the Grand Lodge of England did in fact provide the Freemasons in Pennsylvania to elect a Provincial Grand Master every two years in perpetuity. Because of this we can assume that all successive Provincial Grand Masters of Pennsylvania were elected under the authority of this deputation.\n\nThe Demise of the Moderns in Pennsylvania\nThe Freemasonry of the Moderns Grand Lodge and its daughter lodges in Pennsylvania was eclipsed during the latter half of the 18th century by the rise of the Ancients Grand Lodge and its subordinate lodges. The American Revolutionary War took a great toll on Pennsylvania Freemasonry, and especially the Moderns' lodges. Beginning before the War some of the Modern Lodges had switched allegiance to the Ancients, e.g. Lodge No. 4 of the Moderns. By the end of the Revolution nearly all the lodges in Pennsylvania owed allegiance to the Ancients. It is impossible to determine precisely when the Moderns' Provincial Grand Lodge folded, but it was gone by 1785. The Masonic Hall, built by the Moderns in 1755 was sold, and the proceeds were placed in a charitable trust and became the \"Freemason's Fuel Fund.\" Thus, we can say that the \"Modern\" line was grafted onto the \"Ancient.\"\n\nThe Rise of the Ancients\nThe Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania:  On 15 July 1761, the Ancient Grand Lodge of England issued a warrant for a Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, which appeared as Lodge No. 89 on the Grand Lodge roster. Three years before, the Ancient Grand Lodge had issued a warrant for Lodge No. 69 to a lodge in Philadelphia (later Lodge No. 2 of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania), which had been the first warrant issued to a lodge in North America by that Grand Lodge. As noted above, in a process that began before the Revolutionary War, some Modern Lodges had defected to and were absorbed by the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge thus making the Ancients the dominant form of Freemasonry in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Independent Grand Lodge is Formed\n\nBy 1785, Pennsylvania Freemasonry was entirely Ancient, the Moderns having been fully absorbed into the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. On 25 September 1786, the Ancient Provincial Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania declared itself to be independent of the mother Grand Lodge and closed itself permanently as a provincial grand lodge. The following day, 26 September, the representatives of 13 Ancient lodges met together and reformed the independent Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, headquartered in Philadelphia. Though Pennsylvania Masonic ritual is entirely from the Ancients, and not an amalgamation of the two rituals, the Moderns did not simply cease to exist but were rather absorbed into Ancient Masonry and made to conform to their customs and usages.\n\nSince its inception, the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania has moved its headquarters from building to building over the last two centuries, and on one occasion even conducted their meetings in Independence Hall.\n\nThe first permanent Grand Lodge building was built on Chestnut Street in 1811, in the gothic revivalist style. However it burned down in 1819. A second grand lodge building was constructed in the 1850s, and was sold in 1873, upon completion of the current Masonic Temple in Philadelphia. This building has been the home of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania ever since.\n\nCharitable Endeavors\nThe Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania (and its subordinate Lodges) support five charitable entities that offer a range of services.\n\nThe Masonic Temple, Library, and Museum\nThe headquarters of the Grand Lodge is in the Masonic Temple at One North Broad Street, directly across from Philadelphia City Hall. Built in 1873, it is a national historic landmark renowned for its beauty, architectural mastery and historical significance. The Library contains one of the finest collections for the study of American history and Freemasonry, and the Museum displays more than 30,000 treasured artifacts.\n\nThe Masonic Villages of Pennsylvania\nSince its founding in 1894, the Masonic Home of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, now known as the Masonic Villages of Pennsylvania \n has grown and expanded.\nThe 1400 acres of the Masonic Village at Elizabethtown Campus began as a working farm where the Residents participated in farming chores. Today the farming aspects have been reduced to a prize winning stable of Bulls and a wonderful apple, peach, and cherry orchard. The Elizabethtown campus offers charitable services ranging from a children's home and child care center, to 445 beds of Nursing Home services and 971 units of Retirement living consisting of apartments and cottages.\n\nComprising five continuing care retirement communities across Pennsylvania providing a wide range of care and services, the Masonic Villages\nare committed to caring for residents regardless of their sex, race, creed, Masonic affiliation or ability to pay. The communities extend quality healthcare and outreach services to numerous others through home and community-based services.\n\nThe Masonic Children's Home\nThe Masonic Children's Home is a home for children who come from various socio-economic environments that do not provide the security and support necessary for healthy growth and development. The youth receive food, clothing, complete medical care, academic tutoring and opportunities to participate in worship and extracurricular activities of their choosing.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Masonic Youth Foundation\nThe Foundation offers leadership, education and mentoring programs and resources for youth throughout the Commonwealth, and provides numerous resources and opportunities for Masonic youth groups. It supports initiatives to keep children safe from violence, abuse and exploitation, and provides specialized training for adults who provide leadership to young people.\n\nThe Masonic Charities Fund\nThis special fund supports operations and equipment purchases for The Masonic Library and Museum of Pennsylvania, as well as the restoration and preservation of the Masonic Temple. As needs present themselves, the fund supports scholarships and disaster relief across the globe, to Masonic or non-Masonic recipients.\n\nGrand Masters\n\nThe current Grand Master is Jeffery Wonderling. In Pennsylvania, the Grand Master serves a two-year term. Notably, the regalia of the Grand Master of Pennsylvania is unlike that of any other Masonic Jurisdiction in the United States. The collar is made of velvet and contains no metal save for the bullion thread used to compose the stars. The apron is rounded, both at the base and on the flap, and has no excess ornamentation or fringe.\nThe following men have been Grand Masters.\n\n1730–1731: Daniel Coxe\n1731–1732: William Allen\n1732: Daniel Coxe\n1733: Humphrey Murray\n1734: Benjamin Franklin\n1735: James Hamilton\n1736: Thomas Hopkinson\n1737: William Plumstead\n1738: Joseph Shippen\n1741: Philip Syng\n1747–1748: William Allen\n1749: Benjamin Franklin\n1750–1761: William Allen\n1761: William Ball\n1764–1765: William Ball\n1767–1772: William Ball\n1776–1782: William Ball\n1783–1788: William Adcock\n1789–1794: Jonathan B.

His parents, George Christian Anderson and Violet Brookfield Anderson, came from Denmark and England. He was educated at the Professional Children's School in Manhattan. \n\n\"He first came to radio through a children's community playhouse and started appearing regularly in 1934 on Uncle Nick Kenny's Radio Kindergarten at WMCA.\"\n\nLet's Pretend\nAs a child, he was heard on NBC in the role of the orphan Buddy on the radio network's musical serial drama, Tony and Gus (1935). The following year he joined the cast of Nila Mack's Let's Pretend and continued on that children's program until it came to an end in 1954. In 2004, he wrote a history of the show, Let's Pretend and the Golden Age of Radio (BearManor Media), which includes a foreword by Norman Corwin and a complete broadcast log by Derek Tague and Martin Grams, Jr.\n\nOther radio \nAnderson acted in Welles's The Mercury Theatre on the Air, his CBS Radio series as characters in \"Treasure Island\", \"Julius Caesar\" and \"Sherlock Holmes\". Additional radio credits include the juvenile quiz show, March of Games (1938–1941), produced by Nila Mack and featuring many of the young actors from Let's Pretend.\n\nStage \nAnderson appeared in Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre production of Caesar on Broadway, as portrayed as the character Richard Samuels in the 2008 film Me and Orson Welles. His other Broadway credits include 1776, Il Trovatore, Aida, Carmen, Good Neighbor, and The Shoemakers' Holiday.\n\nFrom serials to cereals\nBeginning in 1963 he was the voice of the General Mills Lucky Charms mascot Lucky the Leprechaun, continuing the character for 29 years even though he is not Irish. In 2005, he recalled:\nPeople have expectations. I just have an Irish-sounding name. I have reason to celebrate. I had the luck of the Irish to get that part. I never got free cereal, but they gave me lots of green money. And it was a fun character to play. Hardly a day goes by when somebody doesn't ask me to sing the Lucky Charms jingle, and I'm proud of that.\n\nTelevision and film\nAnderson succeeded Lionel Wilson as the voice of Eustace Bagge in Courage the Cowardly Dog. His film credits include Midnight Cowboy, Zelig, Green Card and I'm Not Rappaport, and his onscreen television appearances include episodes of Car 54, Where Are You?, Route 66, and Law & Order.\n\nLater years \nLate in life, Anderson was active in Friends of Old Time Radio, a group that recreated  broadcasts using the original scripts and was a regular participant in their conventions. He appeared at the convention 30 times, the most of any actor. He appeared at the very last convention on October 23, 2011. In 2012, he took on the role of honorary chairman for the successor event to Friends of Old Time Radio, NY OTR, which took place on October 12–13, 2012.\n\nPersonal life\nAnderson was married to casting director Alice Middleton. They had one daughter.\n\nDeath\nAnderson died at his Manhattan home on April 9, 2016, at age 93.\n\nAutobiography\n\nAn Actor's Odyssey: Orson Welles to Lucky the Leprechaun, by Arthur Anderson.

Accordingly, common name Cochran frogs has been coined for the genus.\n\nTaxonomy and systematics\nCochranella was first described by Edward Harrison Taylor in 1951. The current delimitation of this genus follows from the work by Juan Manuel Guayasamin and his colleagues published in 2009 (with some later adjustments). These authors remedied the polyphyly of the genus by partitioning it into several new genera.\n\nThe diagnostic characteristics of the genus are the following: (1) humeral spines are absent (small spine present in C. litoralis); (2) digestive tract is white (translucent in Cochranella nola) and the lobed liver is covered by a transparent hepatic peritoneum; (3) ventral parietal peritoneum is white anteriorly and transparent posteriorly; (4) webbing between the fingers III–IV is moderate to extensive; (5) bones are green in life; (6) dorsum is lavender in preserved specimens; (7) dentigerous process of the vomer and vomerine teeth are present (absent in C. litoralis); (8) males call from the upper surfaces of leaves and females deposit eggs on the upper sides of leaves along streams; (9) quadratojugal bone is articulating with maxilla.\n\nSpecies\nCurrently eight species are placed in this genus:\n Cochranella erminea Torres-Gastello, Suárez-Segovia, and Cisneros-Heredia, 2007\n Cochranella euknemos (Savage and Starrett, 1967)\n Cochranella granulosa (Taylor, 1949)\n Cochranella guayasamini Twomey, Delia, and Castroviejo-Fisher, 2014\n Cochranella litoralis (Ruiz-Carranza and Lynch, 1996)\n Cochranella mache Guayasamin and Bonaccorso, 2004\n Cochranella nola Harvey, 1996\n Cochranella resplendens (Lynch and Duellman, 1973)\n\nThe AmphibiaWeb lists 15 Cochranella species, including ones that the Amphibian Species of the World considers as having uncertain placement within the subfamily Centroleninae (Incertae Sedis).\n\nReferences\n\n \nGlass frogs\nAmphibian genera\nAmphibians of Central America\nAmphibians of South America\nTaxa named by Edward Harrison Taylor"}

Aitken was born in Calderbank, Lanarkshire, Scotland.  In 1938 he received a PhD from Edinburgh University on the topic of 'The Trial of George Buchanan Before the Lisbon Inquisition'.\n\nAitken learned chess from his father at age 10.  He was Scottish champion in 1935, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1958, 1960, 1961 and 1965, the latter jointly with PM Jamieson. He was also London Champion in 1950.  In 1959 he had his best result in the British Championship, finishing tied for seventh place. Aitken represented Scotland in four Chess Olympiads.  He played top board at Stockholm 1937, scoring only 32.4% but he did defeat Swedish GM Gideon Ståhlberg and draw with American GM Samuel Reshevsky.  He played second board at Munich 1958 and Tel Aviv 1964, scoring 67.6% and 28.1% respectively.  Aitken played sixth board at Skopje 1972, scoring 38.9%.\n\nAitken represented Great Britain in matches against the USSR and Yugoslavia.

He was co-founder of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O).\n\nCareer\nHe was born at Böd of Gremista, in Lerwick, and as a boy worked on the beach preparing fish. The Crown attempted to press gang Anderson but Bressay man Thomas Bolt persuaded the Royal Navy to wait until he had finished his apprenticeship before his impressment in 1808. Anderson was discharged 10 years later in Plymouth. Like many Shetland men, he was left destitute 600 miles from home after his service to King and country during the Napoleonic wars. Anderson moved to London and eventually became a clerk in the London shipping and insurance firm of Brodie McGhie Willcox where he became a partner in 1822 and the firm was renamed Wilcox and Anderson. They developed the shipping business between Britain and the Iberian peninsula, at one stage shipping guns and the British Legion to fight Portuguese conservatives and Spanish Carlists during their internal wars of the 1830s.\n\nThey followed this with a regular steamship service in 1830, called the Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, which became in 1837 the Peninsular and Orient (P&O). Despite cash crises, it expanded operations to Egypt (1840), India (1842), Hong Kong (1845) and Australia (1852), supported by government mail contracts. Anderson had a thrusting entrepreneurial character and by his death in 1868 P&O had the largest commercial fleet of steamships in the world.\n\nHe moved to Streatham, London, and was Chairman of P&O from 1854 until his death. Other chairs included the coal transport company the Union Steam Ship Company (which he created in 1853 to supply his P&O line ships with fuel) and the Crystal Palace Co.\n\nHe served as a radical Whig MP for the Orkney and Shetland constituency from 1847 to 1852.\n\nHe also founded the Shetland Journal (1835), the Shetland Fishery Company at Vaila, and encouraged fish exports to Spain and business between Shetland and the UK mainland. After Queen Victoria's coronation in 1838, Anderson gave her some Shetland lace articles. The queen subsequently bought twelve pairs of lace stockings which led to a significant increase in sales of Shetland lace.\n\nHe endowed Lower Norwood Working Men's Institute, the Anderson Educational Institute in 1862  (later known as the Anderson High School) and a home for the widows of fishermen in Shetland.\n\nHe was buried at West Norwood Cemetery, with a memorial at Lerwick Old Cemetery.\n\nHis nephew James Anderson, who worked in P&O, was married to the medical pioneer Elizabeth Garrett Anderson.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\nShetland his home\nHistory of the Peninsular and Oriental\n\n1792 births\n1868 deaths\nRoyal Navy sailors\nWhig (British political party) MPs for Scottish constituencies\nMembers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Orkney and Shetland\n19th-century Scottish businesspeople\nScottish company founders\nScottish newspaper editors\nBurials at West Norwood Cemetery\nUK MPs 1847–1852\nScottish businesspeople in shipping\nPeople from Lerwick"}

It has an additional use in gastric variceal obliteration as a dilutant that does not affect polymerization of cyanoacrylate.\n\nIndications \nRecently, there has been an increasing interest in the use of Lipiodol as a therapeutic agent in the management of unexplained infertility, using a procedure called Lipiodol flushing. There have been a small number of studies that suggest that flushing the media through the tubes gives a short-term rise in fecundity in patients with unexplained infertility. A systematic review has suggested a significant increase in fertility, especially in those women who have endometriosis when using Lipiodol flushing.\n\nHistorically Lipiodol was often used as a contrast medium at hysterosalpingography (HSG: a procedure to determine tubal patency, used in the investigation of subfertility). It became less commonly utilized in the 1960s to 1980s because the more modern water-soluble media give images that are easier to interpret. There is also an important safety issue with Lipiodol in that intravasation (leakage) of the fluid into the venous system has caused complications in the past.\n\nComposition \nEthiodized oil is composed of iodine combined with ethyl esters of fatty acids  of poppyseed oil, primarily as ethyl monoiodostearate and ethyl diiodostearate. The precise structure is not known.\n\nHistory \nLipiodol was first synthesized by Marcel Guerbet in the Paris School of Pharmacy in 1901. Historically, Lipiodol was the first iodinated contrast agent (used for myelography by two French physicians, Jacques Forestier and Jean Sicard in 1921).\n\nLipiodol or ethiodized oil for interventional procedure, was solely produced and marketed by Guerbet until Vivere Imaging launched its ethiodized oil in the brand name Vividol in 2022.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nRadiocontrast agents"}

The job encompasses many roles, the most public of which is typically announcing the phrase \"shuffle up and deal!\" at the beginning of the day. A tournament director also declares the tournament blinds and ante structure.\n\nMost tournament directors will be responsible for the structure of the game they are running to ensure the game is completed within a set time scale.  TDs also handle matters such as table consolidation, player registration, etiquette and procedure enforcement, and controlling the game at all stages including important stages such as when the players remaining are close to the bubble, the situation where the number of players remaining in a tournament is only slightly larger than the number of players that shall be getting paid.\n\nThe tournament director carries absolute authority before, during, and after any game of poker, and the decisions they make are final.  Players have no redress if they do not agree with a TDs decision.\n\nAdditionally, tournament directors perform such other tasks as adjudicating disputes between dealers and players and also among the players themselves. Tournament directors are (generally) employees of the casino that the tournament is being hosted at, although this varies. For example, Matt Savage has appeared at various made-for-TV tournaments such as King of Vegas, which do not take place at his place of employment. Other TDs work for travelling tournaments such as the World Poker Tour and the World Series of Poker.\n\nRobert Thompson is another famous tournament director who has appeared on Bravo's Celebrity Poker Showdown ever since season one. Robert is known for saying the famous words of \"Shuffle Up and Deal\" occasionally throughout each episode of the show. Robert would also help out when some of the players wanted to make a bet or a raise, assuring that the proper amount of chips were put out.\n\nSome of the most noted tournament directors in the world today are Matt Savage, who works with various tour circuits, Jack Effel who is the World Series of Poker tournament director and Thomas Kremser, who is the leading tournament director for major events in Europe.\n\nPoker gameplay and terminology"}

Its area is 1,570 km2, and its population is 59,967 (2022). Çivril district area neighbors those of two districts of Uşak Province to its north, namely Sivaslı and Karahallı, and four districts of Afyonkarahisar Province from the north-east to the south which are, clockwise, Sandıklı, Dinar, Dazkırı and Dazkırı, and to its south-west, three districts of the same province as itself depending Denizli. These last three are Bekilli, Çal and Baklan.\n\nIt is the third-most populated district of the province after Merkezefendi and Pamukkale and is situated on a plain to the northeast of the city of Denizli, being actually closer to the neighboring provincial seat of Uşak.\n\nGeneral features\nThe weather is dry and hot in summer, cold in winter. The villagers of Çivril are mostly occupied with growing the district's well-known tasty apples. Many more migrated to work in Germany and other European countries in the 1960s. Thus Çivril has a number of wealthy citizens living abroad or in Istanbul and in summer is populated with returning families for holiday. But in general this is a typical quiet rural Anatolian district.\n\nHistory\n\nBeycehöyük\nDuring an excavation carried out by the British archaeologists Prof. Seton Lloyd and Prof. James Mellaart between 1953 and 1959 at Beycehöyük,  south of the town of Çivril, several artefacts dating back to the Copper Age (circa 3000 BC) were found. It is assumed that Beycehöyük was the centre of the Arzawa kingdom, contemporaries of the Hittite Empire. Later on Phrygians, Carians, Lydians, Persians and Macedonians passed through the region during recorded history but left very few traces.\n\nIt is assumed that the relics of raiders and chariots in mounds and on rocks found at Yavuzca farm,  from Çivril, date back to the Phrygians in whose time the most notable settlement here was called Eumeneia. A tomb located on Beycehöyük dates from Seljuk era.\n\nTurkish era\nA village in Hüdavendigâr vilayet depending from Sandıklı until the 1880s, Çivril gained importance once it became the terminus of a branch of the İzmir-Dinar railway which reached here in 1889. The railway was later extended from Dinar further east to Eğirdir in 1912. Çivril continued to grow by becoming a township with its own municipality in 1892 and a district center in 1910, attached at first to Afyonkarahisar and to Denizli after 1925. The railway line was closed in 1988 and the transportation relies today on intercity buses.\n\nComposition\nThere are 77 neighbourhoods in Çivril District:\n\n Akçaköy\n Akpınar\n Aktaş\n Aşağı\n Balçıkhisar\n Bayat\n Bekirli\n Belence\n Beydilli\n Beyköy\n Bozdağ\n Bucak\n Bulgurlar\n Caber\n Çağlayan\n Çakallar\n Çandır\n Çapak\n Çarşı\n Çatlar\n Çayır\n Çetinler\n Çıtak\n Cumalar\n Düzbel\n Emircik\n Gökgöl\n Gümüşsu\n Gürpınar\n Hamam\n Haydan\n İğdir\n İmrallı\n İnceköy\n Irgıllı\n İshaklı\n Işıklı\n Karabedirler\n Karahacılı\n Karalar\n Karamanlı\n Karayahşılar\n Kavakalanı\n Kavakköy\n Kıralan\n Kızılcasöğüt\n Kızılcayar\n Koçak\n Kocayaka\n Menteş\n Ömerli\n Osmanköy\n Özdemirci\n Reşadiye\n Saray\n Sarıbeyli\n Sarılar\n Savran\n Şehitler\n Şenköy\n Seraserli\n Sökmen\n Somak\n Stadyum\n Sundurlu\n Süngülü\n Tekkeköy\n Tokça\n Tuğlu\n Yahyalı\n Yakacık\n Yalınlı\n Yamanlar\n Yassıhüyük\n Yukarı\n Yukarıçapak\n Yuvaköy\n\nLake Işıklı\n\nÇivril district area is notable by the large size within its boundaries of Lake Işıklı, a freshwater lake which is a fishing reserve and recreational are for its region, aside from being one of the sources of Büyük Menderes River.

The district is said to be named after , the Seljuk commander that captured the region. Kışlacık, Yeşilkent, Yaylak, Okçular, Çatköy, and Ahurlar are places located in Çubuk and used by Yıldırım Bayezid during the 1402 Battle of Ankara which was fought between the Ottoman Empire and Timur.\n\nHistory \n\nÇubuk is a settlement that was established when the Turks conquered and took control of Anatolia. The district is located in the northeast of Ankara. Çubuk gained historical importance when Bayezid I used Çubuk in the Battle of Ankara which was fought between Timur and the Ottoman Empire.  Most of the villages that make up the district were formed by the remnants of armies defeated or left behind after the major battle.\n\nÇubuk is in an area that has been crossed by trade routes since the Middle Ages.

Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 12 May 1967 by Simon & Schuster, Inc., New York, under the title The Purloined Paperweight, and in the United Kingdom on 26 October 1967 by Barrie & Jenkins, London.\n\nThe story is a light-hearted tale of romance and intrigue among impoverished aristocrats, former musical performers, and American millionaires, set at a country house, Ashby Hall.\n\nThe heroine Jane Martyn's brother Algy had previously appeared in Jill the Reckless (1920), and her fiancé Lionel Green and his business partner Orlo Tarvin in Money in the Bank (1942). The butler at Ashby Hall, Ferris, appears to be the same Ferris in The Small Bachelor (1927).\n\nPlot\n\nHenry Paradene, a retired musical comedy actor, has inherited a large country house he can hardly afford to maintain, Ashby Hall near the town of Ashby Paradene in Sussex. Henry's niece Jane Martyn, a secretary for the UK office of Newsweek, is spending the summer with him. Jane's brother Algernon “Algy” Martyn does not work and spends his time coming up with money-making schemes. Henry does not allow Algy at Ashby Hall (since Algy is eager to ask Henry for loans), so Algy lives off his friend Thomas “Bill” Hardy in Valley Fields. On her way to see Algy, Jane asks Bill to help a cat out of a tree, and Bill falls in love with her. Later, Jane has lunch with her fiancé Lionel Green, an interior decorator and antique furniture salesman, after six months of being apart, but Lionel is not enthusiastic to see her and annoys her by bringing his business partner Orlo Tarvin to join them.\n\nA wealthy American named J. Wendell Stickney lives in New York with his widowed aunt by marriage, former chorus girl Kelly Stickney. A distant relative of Henry Paradene, Wendell takes pride in being part of the Paradene family. Henry hopes to sell his house to Wendell, and has Wendell and Kelly visit. Algy is visited by a broker's man named Clarence Binstead who works for the firm Duff and Trotter (a company from Quick Service and Money in the Bank). Algy owes the company for alcoholic drinks, and Binstead's presence puts pressure on Algy to pay his debt. Bill goes to Ashby Paradene in the hope of seeing Jane and meets her again; she learns that, under the pen name Adela Bristow, he wrote a thriller novel both she and her uncle enjoyed reading, Deadly Ernest.\n\nWendell, a collector of French eighteenth-century paperweights, covets one such paperweight kept in Ashby Hall. Henry would like to sell it but legally cannot, since it is an entailed family heirloom (though it seems Henry can legally sell Ashby Hall). Kelly suggests Wendell buy the paperweight from Bill and have Bill pretend it was stolen. She takes the paperweight and gives it to Wendell to mail to New York, but Wendell fears being caught as a thief when he sees Bill, mistakenly believing that Bill is a detective for the trustees (\"some legal firm or other\", according to Henry) of the entail. Wendell is too nervous to mail the paperweight, but fears Henry will change his mind about selling it, and so will not let anyone else mail it for him. Henry wants to marry Kelly; he eventually tells her that he wishes to sell the house to Wendell in order to have enough money to marry her, and she agrees to marry him anyway. Algy wants money to buy a house in Valley Fields and sell it to a company that desires the land for a block of flats, and decides to seek a loan from Wendell. Bill is disheartened to learn that Jane is engaged; however, this engagement ends, as Jane learns from Orlo Tarvin that Lionel is engaged to a millionaire's daughter and did not have the nerve to tell her.\n\nJane has discovered the paperweight is missing and believes Wendell stole it; hoping to get near Wendell to ask for a loan, Algy offers to steal the paperweight back for her (though this does not occur, as Henry later admits the scheme to Algy). Algy also tells Jane that Bill loves her. Bill gets a letter from his New York literary agent saying that Deadly Earnest has become successful and suggests Bill go to New York for his career. Wendell decides to put the paperweight in a safe deposit box at his bank, but he sees Bill again and loses his nerve. Like Algy, Henry owes money to Duff and Trotter, and the company's broker's man Binstead is sent to Ashby Hall. An ex-fiancée of Binstead's works at the house, so he agrees, at Algy's suggestion, to have Bill, who wants an excuse to be near Jane, go in his place and pretend to be the broker's man. Wendell finally puts the paperweight in a safe deposit box in his bank, and, still thinking Bill is a detective, pays him a bribe through Algy. Algy now has the money he needs to invest in the Valley Fields house. Wendell plans to buy Ashby Hall, and Bill and Jane get engaged and intend to live in America.\n\nPublication history\nA condensed version of the story was published in two parts in the Canadian magazine Star Weekly, a weekend supplement of the Toronto Star, under the title The Purloined Paperweight. The first part was published on 29 April 1967, and the second on 6 May 1967.\n\nWodehouse dedicated the US edition: \"To Peter Schwed, best of publishers\".

Its area is 1,482 km2, and its population is 24,588 (2022). It lies  to the northwest of Malatya,  south of Sivas,  east of Kayseri.\n\nHistory\n\nDarende had been known by various names including Taranda/Daranda, and Derindere. It has been presumed that the district had been inhabited since 7000-5000 BC due to the estimations made for the nearby archaeological sites such as Arslantepe and Cafer Höyük.\n\nThe first known administrative unit in Darende was reportedly established by Hittites. One of the Hittites remains within the district is a pair of lion statues residing around Arslantaş region, the west of Darende. In chronological order, the governance to date was controlled by Hittites, Mitanni, Assyrians, Achaemenids, Romans, Byzantines, Umayyads, Abbasids, Seljuks, Danishmends, Rum Seljuks, Ilkhanates, Eretnids, Dulkadirids, Mamluks and Ottomans.\n\nDue to the configuration of the natural canyons surrounding the district (e.g. Tohma Canyon), the district has been reported to be one of the hops residing on trade, migration and military routes connecting various neighbouring regions; as an example, Šuppiluliuma I, who expanded Hittites across the Mediterranean and the Mesopotamia against Egyptian Empire, had been using the district to access the south, and Basil I had been carried out his expeditions against Muslims over the district.\n\nDuring the Roman reign of 200 AD, Darende was one of the Roman settlements which was deduced from the records that the Roman Emperor Trajan had transformed the neighbouring encampment of Melitene into a municipium against the Parthian Empire during the same period. One of the Roman sites within the district is the Ozan Monument which is a single-chamber mausoleum dating back either 200 AD or 50 AD, presumably a popular monument style in Anatolia during the Hellenistic Period.\n\nEarly Muslim conquests reached the region during Caliph Omar's reign and the district was conquered by Habib ibn Maslama for a short period of time, and it was reconquered by the same commander during Mu'awiya I's reign around 653–654. Between 7th and 12th centuries, the administration of the district had changed hands rather frequently; however, Darende seems not to be noted until, for the first time, Taranta had been registered as a bishop under the metropolitan bishop of Melitene in the 13th Notitiae Episcopatuum (12th century).\n\nComposition\nThere are 67 neighbourhoods in Darende District:\n\n Ağılbaşı\n Ağılyazı\n Akbaba\n Akçatoprak\n Akova\n Aşağıulupınar\n Ayvalı\n Balaban\n Barındır\n Başkaya\n Baytarbağı\n Beybağı\n Çaybaşı\n Çınar\n Çukurkaya\n Gaziköy\n Gökçeören\n Gökyar\n Göllüce\n Güdül\n Günerli\n Günpınar\n Hacı Derviş\n Hacılar Şeyhli\n Hacılar Sıragoz\n Hacolar\n Heyiketeği\n Hisarcık\n Hisarkale\n İbrahimpaşa\n Ilıca\n Irmaklı\n Kaldırım\n Karabacak\n Karabayır\n Karaoğuz\n Kavak\n Kaynak\n Kerimli\n Kılıçbağı\n Kölükler\n Kurudere\n Kuzpınar\n Medişeyh\n Mehmetpaşa\n Mollauşağı\n Nadir\n Nurkuyusu\n Ozan\n Palanga\n Sakarya\n Sandıkkaya\n Sayfiye\n Şendere\n Şuğul\n Sungur\n Üçpınar\n Uzunhasan\n Yarımca\n Yavuzlar\n Yazıköy\n Yenice\n Yeniköy\n Yenipınar\n Yeşiltaş\n Yukarıulupınar\n Zaviye\n\nDemographics\nEvliya Çelebi claimed that the town's population was wholly made up of Armenians and Turkomans at the time of his travels.\n\nCulture\n\nFolk music\n\nA metadata analysis on Turkish folk music in Darende has reported twelve ballads of the district:\n\nLanguage of Hazeyince\n\nWithin the circles of craftsman and little artisan of Darende, a cryptolect (mini secret language) called Hazeyince/Hazeynce had been emerged and being used to date.\nThe vocabulary of the cant fetched words from various languages such as Arabic, Persian and Russian, and merged into the Turkish grammar in order to exclude people outside of the circle during communications when necessary.\n\nFestivals\n\nOne of the traditional-summer festivals being held in Darende is the Zengibar Karakucak Wrestling Festival, which is a Oguz-Turkic folk wrestling style.\n\nNotable people\nSomuncu Baba (1331–1412), Ascetic Islamic preacher\nDarendeli Cebecizade Mehmed Pasha (1714-1784), Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire\nDarendeli Topal Izzet Mehmed Pasha (1723-1784) Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire\nTopal Izzet Mehmed Pasha (1792–1855), Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire\nErman Ilıcak (* 1967), Businessperson\n\nReferences\n\nPopulated places in Malatya Province\nDistricts of Malatya Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey"}

{"id": "4103640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic%20forecasting", "title": "Probabilistic forecasting", "text": "Probabilistic forecasting summarizes what is known about, or opinions about, future events. In contrast to single-valued forecasts (such as forecasting that the maximum temperature at a given site on a given day will be 23 degrees Celsius, or that the result in a given football match will be a no-score draw), probabilistic forecasts assign a probability to each of a number of different outcomes, and the complete set of probabilities represents a probability forecast. Thus, probabilistic forecasting is a type of probabilistic classification.\n\nWeather forecasting represents a service in which probability forecasts are sometimes published for public consumption, although it may also be used by weather forecasters as the basis of a simpler type of forecast. For example, forecasters may combine their own experience together with computer-generated probability forecasts to construct a forecast of the type \"we expect heavy rainfall\".\n\nSports betting is another field of application where probabilistic forecasting can play a role. The pre-race odds published for a horse race can be considered to correspond to a summary of bettors' opinions about the likely outcome of a race, although this needs to be tempered with caution as bookmakers' profits needs to be taken into account. In sports betting, probability forecasts may not be published as such, but may underlie bookmakers' activities in setting pay-off rates, etc.\n\nWeather forecasting\n\nProbabilistic forecasting is used in a weather forecasting in a number of ways. One of the simplest is the publication of about rainfall in the form of a probability of precipitation.\n\nEnsembles\n\nThe probability information is typically derived by using several numerical model runs, with slightly varying initial conditions. This technique is usually referred to as ensemble forecasting by an Ensemble Prediction System (EPS). EPS does not produce a full forecast probability distribution over all possible events, and it is possible to use purely statistical or hybrid statistical/numerical methods to do this. For example, temperature can take on a theoretically infinite number of possible values (events); a statistical method would produce a distribution assigning a probability value to every possible temperature. Implausibly high or low temperatures would then have close to zero probability values.\n\nIf it were possible to run the model for every possible set of initial conditions, each with an associated probability, then according to how many members (i.e., individual model runs) of the ensemble predict a certain event, one could compute the actual conditional probability of the given event. In practice, forecasters try to guess a small number of perturbations (usually around 20) that they deem are most likely to yield distinct weather outcomes. Two common techniques for this purpose are breeding vectors (BV) and singular vectors (SV). This technique is not guaranteed to yield an ensemble distribution identical to the actual forecast distribution, but attaining such probabilistic information is one goal of the choice of initial perturbations. Other variants of ensemble forecasting systems that have no immediate probabilistic interpretation include those that assemble the forecasts produced by different numerical weather prediction systems.\n\nExamples\nCanada has been one of the first countries to broadcast their probabilistic forecast by giving chances of precipitation in percentages. As an example of fully probabilistic forecasts, recently, distribution forecasts of rainfall amounts by purely statistical methods have been developed whose performance is competitive with hybrid EPS/statistical rainfall forecasts of daily rainfall amounts.\n\nProbabilistic forecasting has also been used in combination with neural networks for energy generation. This is done via improved weather forecasting using probabilistic intervals to account for uncertainties in wind and solar forecasting, as opposed to traditional techniques such as point forecasting.\n\nEconomic forecasting\nMacroeconomic forecasting is the process of making predictions about the economy for key variables such as GDP and inflation, amongst others, and is generally presented as point forecasts. One of the problems with point forecasts is that they do not convey forecast uncertainties, and this is where the role of probability forecasting may be helpful. Most forecasters would attach probabilities to a range of alternative outcomes or scenarios outside of their central forecasts. These probabilities provide a broader assessment of the risk attached to their central forecasts and are influenced by unexpected or extreme shifts in key variables.\n\nProminent examples of probability forecasting are those undertaken in surveys whereby forecasters are asked, in addition to their central forecasts, for their probability estimates within a specified range. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is one such organisation which publishes probability forecasts in its quarterly MAS Survey of Professional Forecasters. Another is Consensus Economics, a macroeconomic survey firm, which publishes a special survey on forecast probabilities each January in its Consensus Forecasts, Asia Pacific Consensus Forecasts and Eastern Europe Consensus Forecasts publications.\n\nBesides survey firms covering this subject, probability forecasts are also a topic of academic research. This was discussed in a 2000 research paper by Anthony Garratt, Kevin Lee, M. Hashem Pesaran and Yongcheol Shin entitled 'Forecast Uncertainties in Macroeconometric Modelling: An Application to the UK Economy'. The MAS released an article on the topic in its Macroeconomic Review in October 2015 called A Brief Survey of Density Forecasting in Macroeconomics.\n\nEnergy forecasting\nProbabilistic forecasts have not been investigated extensively to date in the context of energy forecasting. However, the situation is changing. While the Global Energy Forecasting Competition (GEFCom) in 2012 was on point forecasting of electric load and wind power, the 2014 edition aimed at probabilistic forecasting of electric load, wind power, solar power and electricity prices. The top two performing teams in the price track of GEFCom2014 used variants of Quantile Regression Averaging (QRA), a new technique which involves applying quantile regression to the point forecasts of a small number of individual forecasting models or experts, hence allows to leverage existing development of point forecasting.\n\nLumina Decision Systems has created an example probabilistic forecast of energy usage for the next 25 years using the US Department of Energy's Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2010.\n\nPopulation forecasting\nProbability forecasts have also been used in the field of population forecasting.\n\nAssessment\n\nAssessing probabilistic forecasts is more complex than assessing deterministic forecasts. If an ensemble-based approach is being used, the individual ensemble members need first to be combined and expressed in terms of a probability distribution. There exist probabilistic (proper) scoring rules such as the continuous ranked probability score for evaluating probabilistic forecasts. One example of such a rule is the Brier score.\n\nSee also\nConsensus forecast\nEnergy forecasting\nForecasting\nForecast skill\nGlobal Energy Forecasting Competitions\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Online results from EPS (from the World Meteorological Organisation)\n\nStatistical forecasting\nProbability assessment\nWeather forecasting\nClimate and weather statistics"}

As it happens, Mike's new butler, Horace Appleby, is actually the leader of a gang of burglars.\n\nPlot\nHorace Appleby, who lives in London suburb Valley Fields, looks and acts like a butler, so he locates jewels for his burglar gang as a butler. He does not allow them to carry guns; American safe-blower Charlie Yost carried a gun, so Horace refuses to pay him. Other henchmen include Llewellyn \"Basher\" Evans, another safe-blower, and Ferdinand Ripley or \"Ferdie the Fly\", who can climb buildings. Horace goes to the races at Wellingford, Worcestershire. In nearby Mallow Hall lives Mike Pond, who recently succeeded his late uncle as owner of the house and Bond's Bank. He employs secretary Ada Cootes, and lives with his aunt Isobel Bond, who is confined to her room with a broken leg and has a nurse, Jill Willard. Someone steals Horace's wallet and Ada hits the thief, recovering the wallet. Horace thanks her and treats her to tea. Ada tells him about Bond's Bank, and Horace plans to rob it. He becomes butler at Mallow Hall to use it as a base of operations. Jill thinks he is a burglar, but she is annoyed with Mike, who once seemed to love her yet is now distant, and does not warn him. Horace has fallen for Ada and proposes to her; at first she is thrilled, but Jill warns her about Horace being a thief, and Ada turns him down.\n\nJill eavesdrops on a conversation between Mike and the bank trustees, General Sir Frederick Featherstone and Augustus \"Gussie\" Mortlake. The bank is insolvent by a hundred thousand pounds. Originally the amount was even greater, but Mike gambled with the depositors' money to bring the amount down; he will go to prison if this is discovered. Mike also mentions that his uncle took out an insurance policy for him: Mike is insured for a hundred thousand pounds if someone injures him with the intent to kill. Jill is glad that Mike's distance was due only to business problems and wants to marry him, but Mike refuses since he may go to prison. Mike wishes someone would rob the bank to hide the truth. Jill suggests to Ada, who knows the combination to the bank's large safe, that they rob the bank. Horace shoots a window with a gun from the Hall's gunroom so the police will only focus on the house. Basher retires from crime, having become religious after a revival meeting, and gives up his ill-gotten gains; Charlie appears, takes the money as his cut, and takes Basher's place. When Charlie tries to rob Gussie Mortlake, Gussie thinks of hiring Charlie to shoot at Mike for the insurance money. A policeman comes by, but Gussie tells him everything is fine, and Charlie gratefully offers his services. Mike reluctantly agrees to Gussie's plan.\n\nJill and Ada start burgling the bank and put money in a suitcase. Horace arrives with subordinates Ferdie, Montgomery \"Smithy\" Smith, and an American named Frank. Jill hides and Ada swoons inside the safe. The gang is stopped by the muscular Basher, who has threatened Charlie into staying away. The safe is open, but Basher quickly shuts it. Ferdie saw a girl inside, and Horace realizes it is Ada. He telephones Mike and admits he is burgling the bank, though Mike initially thinks Horace is drunk, and Aunt Isobel, in the background, says \"Doesn't sound likely. Do butlers burgle banks?\". Horace says that Ada got locked in the airtight safe. Mike provides the combination and Horace rescues Ada. Jill is discovered and Horace politely introduces her to the gang, though Frank flees. Jill is impressed with Horace and apologizes for warning Ada against marrying him; after he agrees to retire from crime, she talks to Ada, and Ada and Horace get engaged. Superintendent Jessop of the Wellingford constabulary appears, and Horace has Ferdie, Smithy, Jill, and Ada pretend they are performing an audit. Jessop leaves convinced. Mike arrives and Jill explains everything to him. Ada explains Jill's scheme to Horace. He tells Jill to bring the suitcase to the Hall. Jessop returns with his supercilious brother-in-law, Sergeant Claude Potter of Scotland Yard, and Horace claims that the bank was robbed after the audit. Potter is suspicious.\n\nMike tries to cancel Gussie's plan with Charlie, but Charlie has given his task to Frank, and Frank will show up at the Hall's back door to shoot at Mike. Jessop and Potter come to the house, and Potter is just about to search the suitcase when the parlourmaid says that there is a man at the back door to see Mike. Potter goes though Mike begs him not to; Potter gets shot in the arm and is expected to be in hospital for a week. Now that the police are on to him, Mike fears he will go to prison if he keeps the suitcase, but the bank will fail if he returns it. Horace, Ferdie, and Smithy finance the bank with their savings and save Mike.\n\nPublication history\n\nThe front of the first US edition dust wrapper was illustrated by John Alcorn, and that of the first UK edition dust wrapper by Osbert Lancaster.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nThe Russian Wodehouse Society's page, with a list of characters\n\nNovels by P.

However, despite being of aristocratic birth, he had been raised with liberal views and thus became supportive of the French Revolution.\n \nIn February 1792 he married Herminie-Felicienne-Joséphine Tavernier de Boulogne de Magnanville and was posted to the Court of St. James's, styled \"Ambassador's Cloak\" (or Deputy Ambassador), under Talleyrand. His role in London was to persuade the British Government to remain neutral in the impending war between France and Austria and Prussia. Arriving in May 1792, Chauvelin was well received at first and secured British neutrality.  However, on 10 August 1792, in light of the storming of the Tuileries and the formal suspension of King Louis XVI of France from power, Chauvelin's status became ambiguous - as his credentials had been issued by a non-ruling king and, moreover, Britain had recalled its own ambassador (and not replaced him), thereby ending official communication.  Following the formation of the French Republic in September, the new French republican government did not promptly renew his credentials, ending what remained of his official status at the Court of St James. Despite Chauvelin's claims to continue as interim representative of France until the arrival of his new credentials (he believed them imminent), foreign secretary William Grenville refused to recognize him as officially speaking for the French republic and returned his papers and missives.  Chauvelin finally received his new credentials from the French republic in January 1793 and requested an audience with the British king to present them. But the timing was inauspicious - Louis XVI had been sentenced to death by the French convention the day before, and would be executed a few days later (21 January).  Chauvelin was ordered to leave England by 1 February 1793, as the British made preparations for war.\n\nAfter returning to Paris and ingratiating himself with the new régime, Chauvelin was posted as French Ambassador to the Medicis in Florence but his term there was unsuccessful, being unable to convince the Grand-Duke to recognize the new French Republic. Chauvelin was recalled to Paris and jailed as a suspect during the Terreur. However, he was released following Robespierre's arrest during the Thermidorean Reaction (27 July 1794).\n\nIn 1800, he was elected to the Tribunat and in February 1804, he was appointed Prefect of La Lys. And in 1811, Chauvelin was created a Baron of the Empire and appointed Councillor of State. From 1812 to 1814, he governed Cataloniastyled Intendant-Généralhaving been expected to win over the Catalans to Joseph Bonaparte, Emperor Napoleon's brother, who had been installed as King of Spain.\n\nIn 1816, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, and spoke in favor of press freedom and extending the electoral franchise. He earned a reputation as an outstanding orator. He was one of the major figures of the left-wing, republican and liberal group in parliament. Though he was returned again as a Deputy in 1827, he played no further part in public affairs, finally resigning in 1829. He then permanently withdrew to the former Abbey of Cîteaux in Beaune, which he had bought and converted into a residence. He died of cholera three years later in Paris.\n\nChauvelin and The Scarlet Pimpernel\nIn Baroness Emmuska Orczy’s novel The Scarlet Pimpernel and its sequels, the Scarlet Pimpernel's arch enemy throughout most of the series is Citizen Chauvelin, a character loosely based on the real Marquis. Although there are some similarities between the real and fictional Chauvelins, Orczy's depiction of Chauvelin's career, personality and history is highly distorted.\n\nSee also\n List of Ambassadors of France to the United Kingdom\n\nReferences\n The Authentic State Papers which Passed Between Monsieur Chauvelin, Minister Plenipotentiary from France, and the Right Hon.

It is the seat of Derinkuyu District. Its population is 10,912 (2022). The elevation is .\n\nLocated in Cappadocia, Derinkuyu is notable for its large multi-level underground city, which is a major tourist attraction. The historical region of Cappadocia, where Derinkuyu is situated, contains several historical underground cities, carved out of a unique geological formation. They are not generally occupied. Over 200 underground cities at least two levels deep have been discovered in the area between Kayseri and Nevşehir, with around 40 of those having at least three levels. The troglodyte cities at Derinkuyu and Kaymaklı are two of the best examples of underground dwellings.\n\nHistory \n\nThe oldest written source about underground structures is the writings of Xenophon. In his Anabasis (circa 370 BCE), he writes that the people living in Anatolia had excavated their houses underground, living well in accommodations large enough for the family, domestic animals, and supplies of stored food. The first two floors of the Derinkuyu Underground City have been dated to this early period.\n\nFrom Byzantine times (4th century CE) through 1923 Derinkuyu was known by its Cappadocian Greek inhabitants as Malakopea (). The underground city was greatly expanded in the middle Byzantine period to serve as a refuge from the raids of the Umayyad Arab and Abbasid armies, during the Arab–Byzantine wars (780-1180). The city contained food stores, kitchens, stalls, churches, wine and oil presses, ventilation shafts, wells, and a religious school. The Derinkuyu underground city has at least eight levels and depth of 85 m and could have sheltered thousands of people. The city continued to be used as protection from the Mongolian incursions of Timur in the 14th century. After the region fell to the Ottomans the cities were used as refuges (Greek: καταφύγια). As late as the 20th century the town's inhabitants, called Cappadocian Greeks, were still using the underground chambers to escape periodic waves of Ottoman persecution. (The Cambridge linguist Dawkins, who spent time in the towns from 1910–1911 while writing his book on Cappadocian Greek wrote, \"their use as places of refuge in time of danger is indicated by their name καταφύγια. In 1909, when the news came of the recent massacres at Adana, a great part of the population at Axo took refuge in these underground chambers, and for some nights did not venture to sleep above ground. When the Cappadocian Greeks were required to leave in 1923 in the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the tunnels were finally abandoned.\n\nImages\n\nSee also \n Avanos\n Churches of Göreme, Turkey\n Eskigümüş Monastery\n Ihlara Valley\n Mokissos\n Özkonak Underground City\n Zelve Monastery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n General information on Derinkuyu, Governorship of Derinkuyu. \n District municipality's official website \n\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey\nCappadocia\nPopulated places in Nevşehir Province\nDerinkuyu District"}

Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 25 September 1969 by Barrie & Jenkins, London, and in the United States on 11 February 1970 by Simon & Schuster, Inc., New York, under the title No Nudes Is Good Nudes.\n\nIt is the tenth full-length novel in the Blandings Castle saga and the last one fully completed by Wodehouse. The title refers to Galahad Threepwood, a survivor of the Pelican Club.\n\nPlot introduction\nBlandings Castle lacks its usual balm for the Earl of Emsworth, as his stern sister Lady Constance Keeble is once more in residence. The Duke of Dunstable is also infesting the place again, along with the standard quota of American millionaires, romantic youths, con artists, imposters and so on. With a painting of a reclining nude at the centre of numerous intrigues, Gally's genius is once again required to sort things out.\n\nPlot summary\nLord Emsworth is in clover at Blandings, with the only guest, Howard Chesney, easily avoided by eating alone in the library. His peace is shattered by the arrival of his sister Connie, along with a friend she has met on the boat over from America, Vanessa Polk, and the news that Dunstable is soon to descend upon the castle adds to his misery. Desperate, he calls on his brother Gally for aid.\n\nGally is in London, meeting his godson Johnny , who announces his engagement to Dunstable's niece Linda. He hurries to the castle, sharing a train carriage with Dunstable, who tells Gally how he has bought a painting of a reclining nude, having heard how anxious the wealthy Wilbur Trout is to buy it; Dunstable plans to bring Trout to Blandings to sell him the picture at a large profit.\n\nAt the castle, Connie urges Dunstable to cosy up with Vanessa Polk, her father's wealth proving an easy lure, and Emsworth's woes are compounded by his beloved Empress' refusal to eat a potato. Gally hears from Linda that her engagement to Halliday is no more, and Halliday himself visits, to explain the incident, a grilling he was obliged to give Linda as a witness in a court case he was defending, which led to their split. He begs Gally to invite him to the castle, but Gally, explaining his position in Connie's bad books, sends him home, promising to do his best on his behalf.\n\nWilbur Trout arrives, and we learn that Vanessa Polk was once engaged to him, and still harbours tender feelings. He tells her the tale of Dunstable's treachery, and she hatches a plan to steal the painting. In London, Halliday hears from his partner Joe Bender that the painting sold to Dunstable was a fake, and he calls in Gally's help. The capable old Pelican arranges to swap the real picture for the fake, but decides to take a bath before replacing the original in the empty frame.\n\nEmsworth, visiting his pig after a worrying dream, falls into the muddy sty, then finds himself locked out, Gally having turned the key on his return from meeting Johnny. He enters the house via Dunstable's rooms, waking up the Duke when surprised by a cat, and later returns to wake the Duke again when he sees the empty frame. When the rest of the household see the picture, now replaced by Gally, the Duke's low opinion of Emsworth's sanity persuades him to call in psychiatric help; Gally recommends Johnny, who he pretends is Sir Roderick Glossop's junior partner.\n\nVanessa Polk, having spotted him for a crook, persuades Chesney to help her steal the painting, but he recognises Halliday, newly arrived at the castle, as the attorney who defended him after an earlier crime went wrong. He plans to leave to avoid being unmasked and return by night for the painting, but seeing Halliday at the top of the stairs, pushes him down. Halliday falls, taking Dunstable with him, and while he angers the Duke he endears himself to Linda, who finds herself kissing his face as he lies prone in the hallway. Linda, now firmly in favour of Halliday, reveals she cannot marry without Dunstable's consent, which he refuses after the stairs incident, and also having recalled Halliday's father, who he never got on with.\n\nConnie calls Glossop's office, finds Halliday is an imposter and ejects him from the castle. Trout and Vanessa meet up in the night to steal the painting, but Chesney fails to turn up, having crashed his car on the way. The two realise they love each other, and leave next morning to get married. Connie insists that Dunstable write to Vanessa proposing marriage; but the letter is intercepted by Gally, who shares with Dunstable his knowledge that Vanessa is not really an heiress, and makes the Duke allow the wedding of Linda and Johnny in exchange for the return of his letter, under threat of a breach of promise suit if it were to reach Vanessa. Connie is recalled to America by her husband, and the Duke returns home, leaving Emsworth once again master of his domain.\n\nCharacters\n The Earl of Emsworth, the absent-minded master of Blandings\n The Hon.

He embraces his deglamorized look and delivers a memorable performance.\" The Times of India critic Neeshita Nyayapati stated: \"Pushpa: The Rise is Allu Arjun's show all the way.

The highest mountain in the range is Mount Siegel at 9,456 ft (2,882 m).\n\nGeography\n\nThe range starts in the north at the Virginia Range (famous for Virginia City and the Comstock Lode).  They continue south for approximately 40 miles where they join with the Sierra Nevada near Topaz Lake and Leviathan Peak.  They are bounded on the west by the Carson Valley and to the east by Mason Valley.\n\nFlora\nThe Pine Nut Mountains take their name from the single-leaf pinyon pines that dominate the slopes between 5000 and 7000 ft.  This is mixed with juniper to form the standard pinyon–juniper woodland plant community.  Lower slopes are dominated by sage–juniper.\n\nCultural\nThe Pine Nut Mountains have been used throughout history by a number of groups for various purposes.  The Washoe tribe used (and still uses) the vast quantities of Pinyon pine for the nuts as a staple in their diet.  The nuts were collected, roasted, and cached during the fall for use during the lean months of winter.  After the discovery of silver and gold in the area, the Pine Nut Mountains became a key source of timber for the building boom and charcoal for the smelters, thus depleting many of the traditional Washoe collection areas.  Today, the range is still used by the Washoe for traditional purposes as well as by hikers, hunters, and other outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Pine Nut Mountains Trail Association\n\nMountain ranges of Nevada\nMountain ranges of the Great Basin\nMountain ranges of Douglas County, Nevada\nMountain ranges of Lyon County, Nevada"}
{"id": "4103719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006%20Southern%20Leyte%20mudslide", "title": "2006 Southern Leyte mudslide", "text": "On February 17, 2006, a massive rock slide-debris avalanche occurred in the Philippine province of Southern Leyte, causing widespread damage and loss of life. The deadly landslide (or debris flow) followed a 10-day period of heavy rain and a minor earthquake (magnitude 2.6 on the Richter scale). The official death toll was 1,126.\n\nOverview\nAt around 10:30 on February 17, 2006, a cliff face of a ridge straddling the Philippine Fault collapsed in a combination rockslide-debris mass movement event, translocating and subsequently burying Guinsaugon village in the township of Saint Bernard. Up to ten smaller landslides had occurred within the previous week in the vicinity of St. Bernard, but Guinsaugon was the worst-hit community.\n\nAmong the worst of the tragedies was the burial of the local elementary school, located nearest to the mountain ridge, as the landslide occurred when school was in session and full of children. Provincial Governor Rosette Lerias said at the time the school had 246 students and seven teachers; only a child and an adult were rescued immediately after the disaster transpired. About 80 women who participated in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of the Guinsaugon Women's Health Association were also lost in the landslide.\n\nLerias said that although several residents had left the area the week before due to the fear of landslides, several of them had returned when the rains had eased.\n\nRescue and relief\nRescue teams including military personnel proceeded to the affected areas. However, relief efforts were hampered by rain, chest-deep mud, roads blocked by boulders, washed-out bridges, and lack of heavy equipment. A minor earthquake in the morning of February 17 also affected the relief operation as the ground remained unstable.\n\nPresident Gloria Macapagal Arroyo gave an address on television stating that \"help is on the way\". Navy and coast guard ships were dispatched to the coastal area.\n\nOn February 17, Philippine National Red Cross chairman Richard J. Gordon who was then in Geneva, Switzerland, attending a board meeting of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement appealed for international assistance.\nHe raised US$1.5 million to help the victims of the mudslides. The funds were used to purchase tents, blankets, cooking utensils, mosquito nets, temporary shelter materials, hygiene articles, water purification tablets and medicines. US$152,000 was released to provide initial assistance. A relief plane was flown into the region carrying emergency trauma kits, rubber boots, ropes, clothing, flashlights and medicine. Three Philippines National Red Cross teams with search and rescue dogs were at the site to provide assistance, with others joining soon afterward. The Red Cross said that it feared that the death toll would be high.\n\nThe United States sent three naval vessels, the USS Curtis Wilbur, USS Essex, and USS Harpers Ferry with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, to the area to provide assistance.\n\nAbout 6,000 U.S. Army and Marine Corps troops were in the Philippines for an annual bilateral exercise. The US government also donated $100,000 worth of disaster equipment to the Philippine National Red Cross. USAID turned over 29 million pesos (about $560,000) worth of food and non-food items.\n\nOther countries donated or pledged assistance to the Philippine government. China offered a donation of $1 million in cash and material. Australia also offered AU$1 million ($740,000) in immediate relief. Taiwan pledged enough medicine to treat 3,000 people for a month and a half along with $100,000. Thailand also pledged $1 million. Malaysia sent a 60-man search-and-rescue and medical assistance team, the Special Malaysia Disaster Assistance Team (SMART). Spain, through a non-government organization, the Unidad Canina de Rescate y Salvamento, sent a six-man rescue team equipped with five sniffer dogs to aid in the relief and rescue efforts. South Korea promised $1 million. New Zealand sent $133,000 to be used in future rescue operations. Singapore said, according to a statement from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, that officials would help the Arroyo administration in any way possible. Indonesia and Turkey offered humanitarian contingents as well.\n\nThe Philippine National Red Cross reported that 53 persons were rescued from the mud on February 17, but the rescue efforts had to be suspended at nightfall for safety reasons.\n\nPossible causes\nCongressman Roger Mercado of Southern Leyte claimed in a Reuters interview that logging and mining done in the area three decades ago was the main culprit. Dave Petley, professor at the International Landslide Centre, Durham University, told the BBC that the causes Mercado mentioned, if proven true, created a \"dangerous combination\" that produced a \"classic landslide scenario\".\n\nHowever, local government officials and eyewitnesses claimed anecdotally that the area was \"well forested\" and the governor's office said that deforestation from mining and logging activities were not the causal factor, although no scientific evidence was presented to back the claims. The governor’s office did not explain why the soil was so unstable at the time of the slide, after millennia of stability.\n\nExperts did agree that torrential rains lasting two weeks before the mudslide were the tipping point that precipitated the disaster.  Rainfall amounting to nearly  over the period of February 4–14 loosened the soil so much that the resulting sludge and rocks thundered down the slopes of nearby Mount Can-abag, virtually disintegrating it.  The La Niña weather phenomenon was blamed for the non-stop rains that occurred in the province. San Francisco, Agusan del Sur mayor Carie Ladernora declared the state of calamity on her town by February 12, 2006.\n\nThe Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology recorded a magnitude 2.6 earthquake in Southern Leyte just prior to the landslide although the effects of this are unclear.\n\n2008 workshop\nAfter two years, the international geoscience community including experts from Japan, Canada, United States, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Hong Kong, UK, Taiwan and the Philippines, came together in Tacloban and St. Bernard to examine known information on the Guinsaugon disaster. In addition, the workshop was tasked with determining the next steps after the disaster. The landslide is classified as a rock slide-debris avalanche using the Varnes (1978) or Cruden and Varnes (1996) classification.  Volume estimates in recent publications range between 14 MCM (million cubic metres) and 20 MCM, converging on or about 15 MCM. There is general accord among scientists that high precipitation a week prior to the failure contributed to the conditions at failure, but the 5 day delay between the rain and the landslide, and the fact that Southern Leyte regularly gets high overall levels of precipitation means that the precise nature of that contribution is unknown.  Similarly, the role of minor ground shaking that occurred at about the same time is still uncertain. \"Was the landslide caused by ground shaking or excessive rain? This is one of the things that is not yet resolved.\" said Dr. Mark Albert Zarco, a professor at the Department of Engineering Sciences, University of the Philippines Diliman in a news story. Importantly, the geological and geomorphological history of the slope including, for example, the prominent strike-slip movement of about 2.5 cm per year, has ultimately lead to failures all along the scarp, including the one that buried Guinsaugon.  Richard Guthrie, of University of Waterloo, Canada, stated: \"We have had very large rains and we have had very large earthquakes in the past; The rocks have been stretched and strained. As time moves on, the rock begins to age and die and finally it collapses. The important thing is that we’re able to know the preconditioning of the slopes.\" Scientists built a synthesis paper on the landslide and a set of recommendations regarding the next steps for the Philippines in relation to landslide hazards.\n\nMay 2006 mudslide\nDue to Typhoon Chanchu (Philippine name: Caloy), flash floods and mudslides isolated at least 11 barangays in Sogod, Southern Leyte. No casualties were reported.\n\nIn popular culture\nFootage taken during helicopter rescues after the mudslide was featured in an episode of the American reality television series, World's Most Amazing Videos.\n\nSee also\n\nList of landslides\nTropical Storm Thelma (Uring, 1991)\nTyphoon Haiyan (Yolanda, 2013)\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources \n\n A.M.F.

{"id": "4103722", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groveland%20Four", "title": "Groveland Four", "text": "The Groveland Four (or the Groveland Boys) were four African American men, Ernest Thomas, Charles Greenlee, Samuel Shepherd, and Walter Irvin. In July 1949, the four were accused of raping a white woman and severely beating her husband in Lake County, Florida. The oldest, Thomas, tried to elude capture and was killed that month. The others were put on trial. Shepard and Irvin received death sentences, and Greenlee was sentenced to life in prison. The events of the case led to serious questions about the arrests, allegedly coerced confessions and mistreatment, and the unusual sentencing following their convictions. Their incarceration was exacerbated by their systemic and unlawful treatment—including the death of Shepherd, and the near-fatal shooting of Irvin. Greenlee was paroled in 1962 and Irvin in 1968. All four were posthumously exonerated by the state of Florida in 2021.\n\nDetails \nThomas, Shepherd, Irvin, and Greenlee (then 16) were accused of raping 17-year-old Norma Padgett and assaulting her husband on July 16, 1949, in Groveland, Lake County, Florida. \n\nOn July 26, 1949, Thomas fled and was killed by a sheriff's posse of 1,000 white men, who shot him over 400 times while he allegedly fled after being found asleep under a tree in southern Madison County. Greenlee, Shepherd, and Irvin were arrested. They were beaten to coerce confessions, but Irvin refused to confess. The three survivors were convicted at trial by an all-white jury. Greenlee was sentenced to life in prison because he was only 16 at the time of the alleged crime; the other two were sentenced to death.\n\nIn 1949, Harry T. Moore, the executive director of the Florida NAACP, organized a campaign against the wrongful conviction of the three African Americans. Two years later, the case of two defendants reached the Supreme Court of the United States on appeal, with special counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund Thurgood Marshall as their defense counsel. In 1951, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a retrial after hearing the appeals of Shepherd and Irvin. It ruled they had not received a fair trial because no evidence had been presented, because of excessive adverse publicity, as well as because black people had been excluded from the jury. The court overturned the convictions and remanded the case to the lower court for a new trial.\n\nIn November 1951, Sheriff Willis V. McCall of Lake County, Florida shot Irvin and Shepherd while they were in his custody and handcuffed together. McCall claimed they had tried to escape while he was transporting them from Raiford State Prison back to the county seat of Tavares for the new trial. Shepherd died on the spot; Irvin survived and later told FBI investigators that McCall had shot them in cold blood and that his deputy, Yates, had also shot him in an attempt to kill him. Harry Moore called for the Governor of Florida to suspend McCall. On Christmas Night 1951, a bomb went off below Moore's house, fatally wounding both him and his wife; he died that night and his wife followed nine days later. The bombers were never caught.\n\nAt the second trial, Irvin was represented by Marshall and again convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. In 1955, his death sentence was commuted to life in prison by recently elected Governor LeRoy Collins. He was paroled in 1968, but died the next year in Lake County, purportedly of natural causes. Greenlee was paroled in 1962 and lived with his family until he died in 2012. In 2016, the City of Groveland and Lake County each apologized to survivors of the four men for the injustice against them. On April 18, 2017, a resolution of the Florida House of Representatives requested that all four men be exonerated. The Florida Senate quickly passed a similar resolution; lawmakers called on Governor Rick Scott to officially pardon the men. On January 11, 2019, the Florida Board of Executive Clemency voted to pardon the Groveland Four. Newly elected Governor Ron DeSantis subsequently did so. On November 22, 2021, Judge Heidi Davis granted the state's motion to posthumously exonerate the men.\n\nThe accused\n\nCharles L. Greenlee\n\nCharles L. Greenlee (born 4 June 1933, Florida), was the son of Thomas H. and Emma Greenlee, who were born in Georgia and Alabama, respectively. His family was living in Columbia County when he was two, but they had moved to Baker County by the time Charles was 12. His father worked in turpentine manufacturing in 1935 and later as a laborer, likely also in the timber industry. In 1945, Charles and four of his siblings were all in school. Greenlee had come to Groveland in July 1949 looking for work, as he was already married and his wife was pregnant.\n\nWalter Irvin\nWalter Lee Irvin (born 8 May 1927, Gainesville, Florida), was living in Groveland when he registered for the draft in May 1945. He listed his mother Ellia Irvin as next of kin. He was working at the time for Apshawa Groves. He was recorded as 5'3\" and weighing 105 pounds, and was described in his registration as \"light brown\", with brown eyes and black hair. He served in the Army, leaving with the rank of private.\n\nSamuel Shepherd\nSamuel Shepherd (born 7 April 1927) was born in Fitzgerald, Georgia to Henry Shepherd and his wife Charlie M (Robinson) Shepherd, both of Georgia. His father was working in the lumber industry. The Shepherd family moved to Groveland, Florida, where his father achieved ownership of his own farm by clearing and developing former swamp land. When Samuel Shepherd registered for the draft in 1945, he was described as 5'8\", 149 pounds, with a light brown complexion, brown eyes and black hair. He gave his father Henry Shepherd as next of kin. Shepherd and Irvin were friends and fellow veterans after World War II.\n\nErnest Thomas\nErnest Thomas (born Florida), was married by July 1949 and living and working near Groveland. He had encouraged Greenlee to come there because of jobs related to the citrus groves.\n \nAfter returning to Groveland following their military service, Shepherd and Irvin both continued to wear their uniforms. They were proud of their service, which some of the local whites resented. Sheriff Willis McCall was known for supporting segregation, and keeping a strong hold on workers and against union organizing. He was part of ensuring there was a ready supply of low-wage workers to man the orange groves. Shepherd could work with his father, and Irvin was determined to find an alternative to the orange groves.\n\nEvents\nErnest Thomas, Charles Greenlee (age 16); Samuel Shepherd (age 22), and Walter Irvin (age 22), were identified by the police as suspects. Shepherd and Irvin were both veterans of service in the Army; and both Thomas and Greenlee were married.\n\nIrvin and Shepherd were arrested shortly after Padgett reported the attack. The police took the men in their patrol car to a secluded spot and ordered them out of the car. Both men were beaten by police with blackjacks and fists and kicked as they lay on the ground, while being asked if they had picked up a white girl. Afterward, they were taken to the spot where the crime happened. Deputy Yates inspected Shepherd's shoes, which he had worn the night before. Yates was frustrated to see that the soles did not match footprints in the ground at the scene. Irvin's were the same, but Irvin claimed that he was wearing a different pair of shoes. The two men were taken to Tavares jail, where they were interrogated in the basement while cuffed to overhead pipes and severely beaten. A mob rioted and burned Shepherd's house and two others to the ground. Only the presence of the National Guard halted the destruction caused by the rioters. Cockcroft, the leader of the riot, revealed the mob's intentions when he told a reporter, \"The next time, we'll clean out every Negro section in south Lake County.\"\n\nFleeing suspect\nCharles Greenlee was a 16-year-old who had come from Gainesville and was trying to find work with his friend Ernest Thomas. Thomas had convinced Greenlee that there were plenty of jobs in Groveland. Greenlee was waiting at a rail depot to meet Thomas when he was arrested and brought to the police station under suspicion.  Greenlee was interrogated and beaten in a cell that night until he admitted to the rape of Norma Padgett. Thomas escaped capture and fled Lake County the following morning. Greenlee admitted to having been with Thomas. Police learned where the latter lived and where he was hiding, as they found a letter in his letterbox addressed to his wife.\n\nLake County Sheriff Willis McCall appointed a posse of more than 1000 armed men. They found and killed Thomas about  away in Madison County, Florida, following a lengthy chase through the swamps. He was shot by the posse at least 400 times and died of his wounds; officers reported that Thomas was armed and allegedly reached for a weapon. According to the coroner's inquest, Lake County Sheriff McCall was at the scene when Thomas was shot. The coroner's jury determined that Thomas had been lawfully killed and ruled his death a justifiable homicide.\n\nTrial\nA grand jury indicted the three remaining rape suspects. Shepherd and Greenlee separately later told FBI investigators that the deputies beat them until they confessed. Irvin refused to confess, despite also being severely beaten. An FBI investigation concluded that Lake County Sheriff's Department deputies James Yates and Leroy Campbell were responsible for the beatings, and agents documented the physical abuse with photographs. The Justice Department urged the U.S. Attorney in Tampa to file charges, but U.S. Attorney Herbert Phillips was reluctant, and failed to return indictments.\n\nThe NAACP helped with the men's defense, hiring Orlando attorney Franklin Williams. After interviewing the three surviving suspects, Williams said each had independently stated that he was beaten by Lake County deputies. Shepherd and Greenlee both told FBI agents that they confessed to raping Padgett in order to stop the beatings. Irvin never confessed and maintained his innocence.\n\nThurgood Marshall, the lead lawyer of the NAACP, pressed the Justice Department and the FBI to initiate a civil rights and domestic violence investigation into the beatings. Marshall convinced the Justice Department that the beatings violated the men's rights, and the FBI dispatched agents to investigate. The FBI later concluded that Lake County deputies James Yates and Leroy Campbell had violated the Groveland men's civil rights and urged U.S. Attorney Herbert Phillips of Florida to prosecute, but a grand jury did not return indictments of the deputies.\n\nThe prosecution never introduced the coerced confessions as evidence into the trial.\n\nThere is uncertainty about whether Padgett was raped. The prosecution did not question Dr. Geoffrey Binneveld, the physician who examined her, on the stand. Judge Truman Futch did not permit the defense to call the doctor as a witness. According to his records, Binneveld could not tell whether she had been raped. He found no evidence of tears or wounds in the vagina other than the lacerations mentioned above. Laboratory analysis of a vaginal smear revealed no spermatozoa present in the vagina, nor any organisms resembling gonococci, which could have been other evidence of sex. There were no other gross signs of bruises, breaks in the skin or other signs of violence.\n\nShepherd and Irvin said that they had been together drinking in Eatonville, Florida, the night of the alleged attack. Greenlee said he was nowhere near the other defendants on that night and that he had never met Shepherd and Irvin before.\n\nThe defense accused Sheriff McCall's deputies of manufacturing evidence to win a conviction. All three men were convicted by the all-white jury. Shepherd and Irvin were sentenced to death, and Greenlee was sentenced to life, as he was a minor.\n\nAppeals and shootings\nThe NAACP took on assisting the defense in appeals. In 1951 Marshall led the defense in an appeals hearing for Irvin and Shepherd at the U.S. Supreme Court. It overturned the convictions of both men based on adverse pre-trial publicity, and remanded the case to the lower court for a new trial. (Greenlee had not appealed his sentence of life imprisonment.)\n\nMcCall was transporting Shepherd and Irvin from Raiford State Prison back to the Lake County jail in Tavares when he claimed to have a flat tire. Alone with the two handcuffed prisoners, McCall pulled down a dirt road to inspect the tire, outside Umatilla, Florida, north of Tavares. He claimed that Shepherd asked to relieve himself, and when the two prisoners, cuffed together, got out of the car, they attacked McCall. He drew his pistol and shot at them. The shooting took place on a dark country road outside the town. He shot each prisoner three times. Shepherd was killed instantly, and Irvin survived by playing dead.\n\nThe following morning, at the hospital where he had been taken for treatment, Irvin told FBI agents and reporter Mabel Norris Reese that the shooting was unprovoked. He said McCall had shot him and Shepherd in cold blood, staging the scene to make it look like an escape attempt, and that Lake County Deputy James Yates had joined McCall at the scene, seen that Irvin was still breathing, and fired one last shot through Irvin's neck. Irvin survived. The FBI later found a bullet buried in the ground beneath Irvin's blood spot that appeared to support his account of the shooting. A nail found in the front wheel of McCall's car appeared to have caused his claimed \"tire trouble\" that night. McCall said that he had no idea how the nail got there, but the FBI believed that it had been placed there.\n\nAn all-white coroner's jury, made up of many of McCall's friends, took half an hour to find Shepherd's death justified. They concluded that McCall had been acting in line of duty and in self-defense. McCall was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nHarry T. Moore bombing\nHarry T. Moore, executive director of the Florida NAACP, demanded in 1951 that McCall be indicted for murder following the Groveland rape case, and requested that the governor suspend him from office. Six weeks after calling for McCall's removal, Moore and his wife were killed by a bomb that exploded under their bedroom in Mims, Brevard County, Florida on December 25, 1951, but an extensive FBI investigation at the time and additional separate investigations in 1978, 1991, and 2005 found no evidence of McCall's involvement.\n\nIn 2005, a new investigation was launched by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement that included excavation of the Moore home to search for forensic evidence. On August 16, 2006, Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist announced his office had completed its 20-month investigation, resulting in the naming of four then suspects—Earl Brooklyn, Tillman Belvin, Joseph Cox and Edward Spivey—all deceased. All four had had a long history with the Ku Klux Klan, serving as officers in the Orange County Klavern. Although members of the Klan were suspected of the crime, the people responsible were never brought to trial.\n\nIrvin's second trial and later life \nAfter recovering from his shooting wounds, Irvin was tried again after refusing a deal from the prosecutor and Governor Fuller Warren that would have spared him from a death sentence if he pleaded guilty. His defense counsel, Thurgood Marshall, gained a change of venue to Marion County, Florida, because of the extensive and adverse publicity around the case in Lake County. Marshall led the defense team from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Irvin was again found guilty. Judge Futch, who was again presiding, sentenced him to death.\n\nAfter LeRoy Collins was elected governor in 1954, questions were raised to him about Irvin's case, because he was considered moderate. He reviewed it and in 1955 commuted Irvin's sentence to life in prison, stating that neither trial proved conclusively that Irvin was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Irvin was paroled in 1968. In 1969 he visited Lake County, where he was found dead in his car, officially of natural causes.\n\nGreenlee paroled \nGreenlee was paroled from prison in 1962. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, with his wife and their daughter Carole, who was born in 1950 (his wife was pregnant when he was arrested). They had a son, Thomas, in 1965. Greenlee died on April 18, 2012, but not before seeing Gilbert King's 2012 book about the case published.\n\nExoneration \nIn 2016 the Lake County Commission followed Groveland Mayor Tim Loucks in presenting the surviving families of the Groveland Four with a posthumous apology.  Both Loucks and members of the Lake County Commission then began lobbying state lawmakers to do the same. Senator Geraldine Thompson, D-Orlando, filed a proposed resolution (SCR 136) for consideration during the 2016 legislative session to clear the names of Greenlee, Irvin, Shepherd, and Thomas and note the “egregious wrongs” the criminal justice system perpetrated against them.\n\nOn April 18, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives passed a resolution sponsored by State Representative Bobby DuBose requesting exoneration for the four men and apologizing to their families for the injustice of the case. The Florida State Senate passed an identical resolution sponsored by Senator Gary Farmer on April 27, 2017. The resolutions called on Governor Rick Scott to expedite the process to grant posthumous pardons. Lawmakers also called on Scott to pardon the men.\n\nOn January 11, 2019, the Florida Board of Executive Clemency, with newly seated Governor Ron DeSantis at the helm, unanimously agreed to pardon the Groveland Four. \"Seventy years is a long time\", DeSantis said before taking office. \"And that's the amount of time four young men have been wrongly written into Florida history for crimes they did not commit and punishments they did not deserve.\" Norma Padgett, then 86, speaking publicly about the case for the first time since 1952, attended the Clemency Board hearing to make a statement against exoneration, saying:\nI'm beggin' y'all not to give them pardon because they done it. Your minds might be made up. I don't know. If you do, y'all going to be just like them, and that's all I got to say, 'cause I know I'm telling the truth. I went to court twice.\n\nDeSantis issued the four men full posthumous pardons in 2019, but they were not exonerated by the state until 2021. After a motion submitted by State Attorney William M. Gladson, Judge Heidi Davis granted the state's motion on November 22, 2021, to posthumously dismiss the indictments of Thomas and Shepherd and vacate the convictions of Greenlee and Irvin.\n\nSee also\nFalse accusations of rape as justification for lynchings\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \nFormer Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall argued two cases in Ocala with mention of Willis V.

Its area is 534 km2, and its population is 47,360 (2022).\n\nThe district is quite picturesque both along its Aegean shoreline and in its inland parts, and is a popular summer resort. The central town of Dikili is situated at about  north of İzmir, served by a good road. The notable township of Çandarlı (ancient Pitane) is located close to Dikili.\n\nHistory\n\nThe ancient and as yet unexplored site of Atarneus is located nearby. The site is called \"Atarna\" locally.\n\nDikili is the birthplace of the Greek American left-wing activist and artist Aristodimos Kaldis (1899 – 1979), the Greek archaeologist Efstratios Pelekidis (1880/1882 - 1958), and the Greek poet and playwright Angelos Simiriotis (1873 – 1944).\n\nGeography\n\nDikili town centre is situated opposite the Greek island of Lesbos. A small islet within Dikili district (called Garip Adası locally, with ancient sources also citing the name Argounissai) made international headlines in April 2007.

It was first published in the United Kingdom on 29 October 1970 by Barrie & Jenkins, London, and in the United States on 22 February 1971 by Simon & Schuster, Inc., New York.\n\nIn the novel, cartoonist Jerry West falls in love with air hostess Jane Hunnicut, but before Jerry can marry her, he is faced with the task of recovering the eponymous painting, a missing Gainsborough miniature.\n\nPlot \n\nIn New York, Duane Stottlemeyer of Guildenstern's Stores tells corporation lawyer Homer Pyle that Homer's sister, Bernadette \"Barney\" Claybourne, has been arrested for shoplifting, despite being rich. The company will not press charges if she leaves the city. Duane proposes that Homer keep his sister away from department stores by sending her to an English country house that takes paying guests, and suggests Mellingham Hall, near the village Mellingham-in-the-Vale. Homer agrees, as he knows the brother of the man who runs it. Homer brings his sister to London to make the arrangements.\n\nIn London, comic cartoonist Gerald \"Jerry\" West attends jury duty, and falls in love with a fellow juror. An intelligent girl, she leads the jury deliberation to a unanimous vote. Jerry speaks with her afterwards. She enjoys his cartoons and is an air hostess on leave. They make plans for dinner later that week at Barribault's, though Jerry forgets to ask for her name. He soon remembers that he is already engaged, to the beautiful yet critical Vera Upshaw, a writer. Vera wants Jerry to demand his inheritance, which is supposed to be held in trust for three more years, from his trustee, his uncle Willoughby \"Bill\" Scrope. Bill's older brother, Crispin Scrope, struggles financially to maintain the manor he inherited, Mellingham Hall, and to pay off a broker's man from a repair company, obtains a loan of approximately two hundred pounds from Bill, who is a wealthy lawyer. Bill is a miniature portrait collector, and has acquired a Gainsborough miniature of a direct ancestor, titled The Girl in Blue.\n\nHomer Pyle is a fan of Vera's books and thrilled to meet her in a book shop. With the encouragement of her mother, actress Dame Flora Faye, Vera leaves Jerry to pursue the wealthier Homer. Barney says to Homer that her shoplifting was a one-time experiment, but Homer fears she will steal The Girl in Blue and warns Bill. Homer later hides it in a desk at Bill's house. He tries to inform Bill's secretary about this but the message is lost. The girl Jerry loves happens to be contacted by Bill's legal firm about an inheritance; Bill informs Jerry that her name is Jane Hunnicut and she is now rich, having received a surprise legacy from a former passenger. Jerry is disheartened, believing he does not have enough money to marry a rich heiress. Crispin gambles half his loan from Bill on a horse, Brotherly Love. In Mellingham-in-the-Vale, Constable Ernest Simms informs Crispin that he has been disrespected and threatened by Crispin's uncouth butler Reginald Chippendale, but Crispin cannot fire Chippendale, since he is actually the broker's man. Bill discovers the miniature is gone and believes Barney stole it. He offers Cripsin two hundred pounds to steal it back from her, but Crispin likes Barney and initially refuses. However, after Brotherly Love loses, coming in second, Crispin agrees to split the reward fifty-fifty with Chippendale, who will search Barney's room.\n\nBill agrees to let Jerry receive his inheritance early if Jerry steals back the miniature. Homer goes to Mellingham Hall, with Vera following by paying to stay at the house. Jane loves Jerry and pays for a stay as well. Jane tries to tell Jerry he does not need money to marry her, but he is not convinced. Jerry and Chippendale both search Barney's room. Jerry is caught and hit by Barney on the head, while Chippendale escapes. Barney donates an inexpensive miniature portrait to a church jumble sale, but Crispin mistakenly believes she donated The Girl in Blue and Chippendale buys it. He will give this miniature to Crispin if Crispin pushes Constable Simms into a brook. Crispin tells Barney enough about the situation for her to volunteer to push Simms in for him; the soaked constable does not see who pushed him, but suspects Chippendale. However, this miniature proves worthless. Willoughby learns from Homer that The Girl in Blue is in his desk, and does not pay Crispin. However, he does let Jerry get his inheritance, so that Jerry can marry Jane. Jerry and Jane are both happy to hear that the legacy Jane received will be greatly reduced because of the deceased's unpaid taxes, so it will not come between them. Brotherly Love was awarded victory since the winner was disqualified, so Crispin can pay off the broker's man. Homer wants to marry Vera, until he realizes she is after his money. Barney and Crispin happily get engaged, and so do Jerry and Jane.\n\nPublication history\nThe dust jackets of the first UK and US editions both feature the same design on the front by Osbert Lancaster.

{"id": "4103750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg%20Hickey", "title": "Reg Hickey", "text": "Reginald Joseph Hickey (27 March 1906 – 13 December 1973) was an Australian rules footballer who was a player, the captain, the captain-coach, and the non-playing coach for the  Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) between 1928 and 1940 (player), and between 1949 and 1959 (non-player). \n\nIn the 34 seasons from 1926 to 1959 he was involved in four Geelong VFL premierships: one as a player (1931), one as captain-coach (1937), and two as non-playing coach (1951, and 1952) – he was also the non-playing coach of a losing Grand Final team (1953), where an inaccurate Geelong (8.17 (65)) lost to Collingwood (11.11 (77)).\n\nFamily\nThe son of Martin Hickey (1873-1944),<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11816858/627588 Deaths: Hickey, The Argus, (Saturday, 4 March 1944), p.13.]</ref> and Margaret Teresa Hickey (1877-1965), née Meaney, Reginald Joseph Hickey was born in Collingwood on 27 March 1906.\n\nHe married Doreen Stella Markin (1916-1963) on 26 October 1938.\n\nHe was the nephew of Fitzroy (VFA & VFL) footballer Pat Hickey, and Fitzroy (VFA) footballer and Fitzroy (VFL) administrator Con Hickey. He is the grandfather of former Port Adelaide coach and captain Matthew Primus, and  AFL Women's (AFLW) player Melissa Hickey is the granddaughter of his cousin.\n\nHe was in the same class as the inaugural Brownlow Medal winner, Edward \"Carji\" Greeves at the Struan Dam State School (3730), near to Cressy and Lismore in Western Victoria.\n\nFootball\nA strong, fast, and intelligent player, who could kick with either foot, Hickey played 245 games for Geelong in a career spanning fifteen years, including two premierships, two club best-and-fairest awards, and nine seasons as club captain. Hickey also was a hard (but equally fair) coach, who helping build Geelong into a powerhouse during the early 1950s.\n\nHickey coached Geelong in 304 matches, including 91 matches as playing coach. As coach, he had a 60% winning record.\n\n Playing career \nGeelong recruited Hickey for the start of the 1926 season, with Hickey himself making a name as a tough defender, renowned for his dashing runs out of the defensive half.\n\nHe retired as a player in May 1940.\n\n Captain-coach \nHickey was named captain-coach in 1932, but relinquished the coaching position to Arthur Coghlan the following season, although he remained captain of the team. In 1936, Hickey resumed his role as captain-coach, and continued, as such, until his retirement in 1940. By then he was the games record-holder for the club, and held that record until Bill Goggin took over in 1971.\n\nHickey's finest moment as captain-coach came in the 1937 Grand Final against Collingwood. Until the three quarter time break (when the scores were level), the contest had been relatively even between, with neither side being able to get ahead by more than a few points. In an effort to break the deadlock, and in a coaching move almost unheard of in those days, Hickey made wholesale positional changes:\n moving Les Hardiman from full-forward to centre half-back (Hardiman nullified the previously dominating Ron Todd);\n moving Jack Evans from the ruck to replace Hardiman at full-forward (Evans kicked 6 goals);\n moving Joe Sellwood from centre half-back to replace Gordon Abbott at centre half-forward; and\n moving Abbott from centre half-forward to replace Evans in the ruck.\n\nHis strategy worked, and Geelong comfortably won the match, kicking 6.6 (42) to Collingwood's 1.4 (10) in the last quarter.\n\nBrownlow Medal\nHickey came third to Fitzroy's Haydn Bunton in the 1931 Brownlow Medal, and second to Fitzroy's Denis Ryan in the 1936 Brownlow Medal.\n\n Coaching career \nDue to travel restrictions and an exodus of players to war service in the Second World War, Geelong were unable to field a side for the 1942 and 1943 seasons.\n\nPlayers transferred to other clubs; when Geelong rejoined the competition in 1944 season, but not all of those transferred returned to Geelong. The club finished close to or on the bottom of the ladder for the rest of the 1940s, claiming the wooden spoon in 1944 with a 1-17 record, and narrowly avoiding the 1945 wooden spoon on percentage.\n\nHickey was appointed coach for the third time in 1949, with immediate success. Though the club failed to make the finals, they showed marked improvement.\n\nHickey had a policy of fast, direct play, relentlessly drilling his players to ensure they made every possession count. In 1950, Geelong made the finals for the first time in ten years. For the next two and a half years, Geelong was the strongest side in the competition, winning two consecutive flags, and establishing a VFL/AFL record of 23 wins (unbeaten streak of 26) in a row during 1952 and 1953. It wasn't until the end of 1953 that Collingwood, with the use of ugly and restrictive football, were able to inflict defeat on Hickey's side. Geelong lost the Grand Final, and saw little success for the rest of Hickey's tenure — he retired from coaching at the end of the 1959 season.\n\nDeath\nHe died at Geelong on 13 December 1973 and is buried in Geelong Western Cemetery, Minerva Rd, Herne Hill.\n\nRecognition\n Selected as the captain, coach, and centre half back of Geelong's official \"Team of the Century\".\n Selected on the interchange bench in the Victorian Team of the 20th Century.\n Inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996.\n The Eastern Stand at Skilled Stadium, Geelong's home ground, is named after him.\n The prestigious R.J.

Its mission is to support operations at RAF Alconbury and the nearby base of RAF Molesworth.  Its primary customer is the Joint Analysis Center located at RAF Molesworth.\n\nUnits\n the 423rd Air Base Group is made up of the following units:\n 421st Air Base Squadron (421 ABS) (RAF Menwith Hill, United Kingdom)\n 423rd Civil Engineer Squadron (423 CES)\n 423rd Communications Squadron (423 CS)\n 423rd Force Support Squadron (423 FSS)\n 423rd Medical Squadron (423 MDS)\n 423rd Security Forces Squadron (423 SFS)\n 426th Air Base Squadron (426 ABS) (Sola Air Station, Norway)\n\nHistory\n\nWorld War II\nThe group was first organized at Duncan Field, Texas in 1942 as the 45th Air Depot Group.  After training in the United States, it moved to England, where it supported units of Ninth Air Force.  Its main components were a Supply Squadron and a Repair Squadron, although it also included non-Air Corps units from ordnance, quartermaster, and chemical branches.\n\nIt moved to the continent of Europe in 1944.  There, a number of mobile reclamation squadrons were assigned for brief periods.  Following V-E Day, the group remained in Germany as part of the occupation forces until inactivating in 1947.\n\nDepot support in France\nThe unit, redesignated the 73rd Air Depot Wing was organized at Kelly Field.  Once organized, it moved to France to operate the Chateauroux Air Depot.  However, it was inactivated in 1953 and replaced by the 7373rd Air Depot Wing, as the Air Force converted many support units to table of distribution units.\n\nSupport in England\nThe 423rd Air Base Group was activated on 12 May 2005, when it replaced the 423rd Air Base Squadron, which had been activated on 12 July 1995 at RAF Molesworth.  The 423 ABS replaced the inactivated 710th Air Base Wing, briefly active at Alconbury to replace the 10th Air Base Wing, which had moved to Colorado on 1 November 1994. Exactly 10 years later, the 423rd ABS was replaced by the 423rd Air Base Group.  This was part of a larger reorganization of many geographically separated units within the United Kingdom as components of the 501st Combat Support Wing also located at RAF Alconbury.  At this time, 423 ABG headquarters officially moved to RAF Alconbury.\n\nIn 2012, the group included around 400 personnel, including about 277 active duty military, 140 Department of Defense civilians and 170 Non-Appropriated Fund employees, as well as 255 Ministry of Defence employees.\n\nOrganization \nThe group is organized into a group staff and six squadrons.  The squadrons include the 423rd Communications Squadron, 423rd Medical Squadron (initiated 2007), 423rd Security Forces Squadron, 423rd Force Support Squadron, and 423rd Civil Engineer Squadron.  The 426th Air Base Squadron is also under the 423rd Air Base Group but is geographically separated and physically located at Stavanger Air Base, Norway.\n\nLineage\n Constituted as the 45th Air Depot Group on 31 January 1942\n Activated on 13 March 1942\n Redesignated 45th Air Depot c. 1 January 1946\n Inactivated c. 31 August 1947\n Redesignated 73rd Air Depot Wing\n Activated on 9 January 1951\n Inactivated on 15 November 1953\n Disbanded on 15 June 1983\n Reconstituted on 22 March 2005 and redesignated 423rd Air Base Group\n Activated on 12 May 2005\n\nAssignments\n Air Service Command, 13 March 1942\n Eighth Air Force, July 1943\n IX Air Force Service Command (later European Air Materiel Command), January 1944 – c. 31 August 1947\n San Antonio Air Materiel Area, 9 January 1951\n United States Air Forces in Europe, 25 July 1951 – 15 November 1953\n 501st Combat Support Wing, 12 May 2005 – present\n\nStations\n Duncan Field, Texas 13 March 1942\n Springfield, Illinois, 19 April 1942\n Brookley Field, Alabama, September 1942\n RAF Grove (AAF-519), England, July 1943\n Chartres (A-40), France, October 1944\n Denbury, England, January 1945\n Valenciennes, France, March 1945\n Denain/Prouvy Airfield (A-87), France April 1945\n Hanau-Langendiebach Airfield (Y-91), 1945\n Erding Air Depot (R-91), December 1945 – c. 31 August 1947\n Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, 9 January 1951\n Chateauroux Air Base, 25 July 1951 – 15 November 1953\n RAF Alconbury, 12 May 2005 – present\n\nComponents\n Groups\n 73rd Air Base Group, 9 January 1951 – 15 November 1953\n 73rd Maintenance Group, 9 January 1951 – 15 November 1953\n 73rd Medical Group, 9 January 1951 – 15 November 1953\n 73rd Supply Group, 9 January 1951 – 15 November 1953\n 73rd Transportation Group, 9 January 1951 – 15 November 1953\n\n Squadrons\n 23rd Mobile Reclamation and Repair Squadron, 1 November 1943 – c. 31 May 1945\n 25th Mobile Reclamation and Repair Squadron, 1945 – 14 June 1945\n 27th Mobile Reclamation and Repair Squadron, 1944 – c. 31 May 1945\n 33rd Mobile Reclamation and Repair Squadron, 1944\n 42nd Mobile Reclamation and Repair Squadron, c.

As a British Indian Army officer during World War II, he survived a Japanese POW camp in Singapore. He played a key role in establishing the ceasefire during the First Kashmir War. During his stint as the Military attaché of Pakistan to Washington , he helped negotiate Pakistan's membership in the Baghdad Pact and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. \n\nAn ethnic Pashtun, he retired from the Pakistan Army in 1962 due to the autocratic rule of Ayub Khan. Afterwards, he was involved in business and joined politics.\n\nHe was repeatedly arrested by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in the 1970s for his political beliefs and was in jail for more than three years with Amnesty International declaring him a prisoner of conscience in 1974. During a medical checkup, he escaped from custody and took political asylum in the United States in 1975 becoming a citizen in 1981.\n\nEarly life\nJilani was born in 1913 in Sibi in the Chief Commissioner's Province of Balochistan.\n\nEducation\nHe was educated at Forman Christian College in Lahore and later in Law at the Aligarh Muslim University, in India.\n\nPersonal life\nHe married Nancy Habiba Jilani in 1949 and they had 4 children. Their son Mian Arshad Jilani and three daughters Hadia Jilani Roberts, Halima Jilani Raza, and Habiba Jilani Freeman. At the time of his death, Mian Ghulam Jilani had 9 grandchildren.\n\nBritish Indian Army career\nHe completed his officer's training at the Rashtriya Indian Military College at Dehra Dun in British India and was commissioned as second lieutenant on to the Special List, Indian Land Forces on 1 February 1936 and attached to the 2nd battalion the Royal Scots Regiment on 24 February 1936 for a years experience before joining his British Indian Army regiment. He was accepted for the Indian Army on 24 February 1937 and posted to the 4th battalion 19th Hyderabad Regiment. His seniority as a second lieutenant was antedated to 3 February 1935 and he was promoted Lieutenant 3 May 1937. He was later appointed acting Captain and then appointed Adjutant of the 4/19th 1 October 1940.\n\nCaptured at Singapore\nDuring the Second World War, the fourth battalion 19th Hyderabad Regiment was sent to Singapore with the British Indian Army. Jilani was captured and taken prisoner by the Japanese in 1942. He was a prisoner of war for nearly forty months. During this period, he was tortured and kept in solitary confinement for seven months. Whilst a prisoner of war he was promoted Captain. He was mentioned in despatches in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Malaya in 1942.\n\nShortly after World War II, the movement for independence from the British resulted in Partition of British India in 1947. Jilani threw his energy and enthusiasm behind it.\n\nPakistan Army career\n\nKashmir Operations\nHe joined the newly formed Pakistan Army and was the 42nd senior most officer (PA–42), commanding 4 Frontier Regiment. A few weeks later he took a leave of absence from the army to volunteer as a fighter in Kashmir, fighting for its independence and right to join Pakistan.  In April 1948, he was appointed Commanding Officer at Gilgit where he remained until the ceasefire.\n\nHis troops played a major role in establishing what would later become the Line of Control between India and Pakistan. He fought a guerrilla war in northern Kashmir engaging two divisions of the Indian Army subsequently taking over Baltistan.\n\nHe played a key role in the ceasefire of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.\n\nRelations with the United States\nAs a Brigadier, he was posted as the first Military attaché of Pakistan to Washington in October 1952. He was accredited Military Attache to Canada and Mexico.\n\nAwarded by Eisenhower\nHe brought about the military aid treaty, known as the Baghdad Pact between the United States and Pakistan in May 1954 for which in 1955 he was awarded the Legion of Merit by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The Government of Pakistan awarded him the Sitara-i-Quaid-i-Azam (Star of the Quaid), named after the Founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\n\nSenior Commander\nOn promotion to Major General, he served as GOC East Pakistan commanding 14th Infantry Division (Dhaka), Commandant of the Command and Staff College (July 1957 – December 1958), Master General of Ordnance (GHQ) and GOC 15th Infantry Division (Sialkot).\n\nAs GOC 15th Div he along with (then) Brig Rakhman Gul  Inspector General Frontier Corps served under (then) Maj Gen Attiqur Rahman  GOC 7th Infantry Division who was the Force Commander for the Bajaur Campaign of October 1960. After the Nawab of Dir Sir Shah Jehan Khan and his son Khan Shahabud Din Khan of Jandol were captured on 28 October 1948, Maj Gen Attiqur Rahman MC moved back to Peshawar and Jilani took over as Force Commander.\n\nRetirement\nAfter retiring from the army, he was hired by Fakhrudin Valika as a General Manager with the Valika Group in Karachi.\n\nPolitical career\nHe joined the National Awami Party (Wali) and became a member of the provincial assembly of North West Frontier Province from his home constituency in Mardan in the 1970 Pakistani general election after receiving 16,346 votes. He was the head of the NAP-Ws youth wing, Zalmay Pakhtun.\n\nArrest\nHe was an outspoken critic of the government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and was arrested by the Pakistan Peoples Party government on 15 February 1973.\n\nHis wife Mrs. Nancy Habiba Jilani filed a writ petition against his detention, and the judgment of the Lahore High Court was authored by Nasim Hasan Shah, J. and is reported as: Mrs. Habiba Jilani V Federation of Pakistan (PLD 1974 Lahore 153). The Lahore High Court declared the detention valid.\n\nIn a crackdown on his party, a smear campaign was launched against him and Jilani was frequently arrested. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto then attempted to bribe Jilani with offers of high positions—all to no avail. Nonetheless, all charges against Jilani were repeatedly dismissed by the courts. Amnesty International adopted him as a \"prisoner of conscience\" in 1974.\n\nEscape from Jail\nJilani managed to escape from guards during a hospital visit in 1975 and was granted political asylum in the United States. He became a US citizen in 1981.\n\nUS Residency\nAfter becoming a citizen of the United States, he gave speeches at colleges, government agencies, and veterans organizations.

{"id": "4103794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation%20Prone", "title": "Operation Prone", "text": "Operation Prone was a proposed military operation by the South African Defence Force (SADF) and South West African Territorial Force (SWATF) during the South African Border War and Angolan Civil War between May and September 1988. With the advance of the 50th Cuban Division towards Calueque and the South-West Africa border, the SADF formed the 10 SA Division to counter this threat. The plan for Operation Prone had two phases. Operation Linger was to be a counterinsurgency phase and Operation Pact a conventional phase.\n\nBackground and threat assessment\nCaught off guard by the rapid movement southwards by the Cuban 10th Division, whose appearance was first noticed during April/May 1988 when SADF units in south-western Angola started to come into contact with advancing Cuban/FAPLA units, serious planning began. Initially, the plans were developed as a proposed attack on the Cuban/FAPLA forces in south-western Angola but as events played out and peace talks developed, the plan evolved to one of defence of north-western South-West Africa.\n\nThe South Africans anticipated attacks from two or three fronts possibly from Cahama, Xangongo or Ondjiva towards Ruacana and Calueque. They believed that the Cubans response to any South African counterattack, could be attacks by Cuban forces on SADF bases at Rundu, Ruacana, Oshakati, Ondangwa and Grootfontein and could also involve SWAPO insurgents in the SADF rear during the attacks. The SADF's main conventional unit in SWA, 61 Mechanised Battalion was in a state of reorganisation and training after Operation Hooper. 32 Battalion and 101 Battalion were engaged in south-western Angola against SWAPO while the other main conventional unit, 4 SAI, was also reorganising in South Africa and would be combat ready in SWA by 25 July. The South Africans did not believe that Cuban/FAPLA forces in south-eastern Angola at Cuito Cuanavale would try to attack the UNITA's bases at Mavinga and Jamba. This meant Cuban/FAPLA forces would concentrate their efforts in south-western Angola.\n\nOrder of battle\n\nSouth African and South West Africa Territorial forces\n\n10 SA Division (Operation Hilti/Prone) - Brigadier Chris Serfontein\n HQ 10 SA Division - Oshakati\n 61 Mechanised Battalion incl. one tank squadron\n 4 SAI Battalion - no tank squadron\n 32 Battalion\n 101 Battalion\n 81 Armoured Brigade (South Africa) Brigade HQ\n one G-2 battery - 17 Field Regiment\n one tank regiment - 3 squadrons Pretoria Regiment\n one mechanized battalion - 1 Regiment Northern Transvaal\n one armoured car regiment - 2 Light Horse Regiment\n one field engineer regiment - 15 Field Regiment\n one anti-aircraft battery - Regiment Oos Transvaal\n one engineer support squadron\n one signal unit - 81 Signal Regiment\n one maintenance unit - 20 Maintenance Unit\n one field workshop - 32 Field Regiment\n one medical battalion group - 6 Medical Battalion Group\n one provost platoon - 8 Provost Unit\n71 Motorised Brigade\n HQ Cape Town Highlanders\n two mechanized infantry companies - Cape Town Highlanders Regiment\n one support weapons company - Cape Town Highlanders\n one armoured car regiment - Regiment Orange River\n one field engineer troop - 6 Field Engineer Regiment\n one signal troop - 7 Signal Group\n one maintenance platoon - 4 Maintenance Unit\n one medical battalion - 3 Medical Battalion\n one light workshop troop - 71 Field Regiment\n one provost platoon - 7 Provost Unit\nParachute Battalion Group\n three parachute companies\n one parachute support company\n one anti aircraft troop\n one engineer troop\n one signal troop\n one maintenance platoon\n one reconnaissance section\n one light workshop troop\n one provost platoon\n one medical team\n two mobile air operations teams\n 10 Artillery Brigade\n HQ 10 Artillery Brigade\n one G-5 battery - 4 SAI\n one G-5 battery - 61 Mechanised Battalion\n one G-2 battery - Transvaal State Artillery\n one G-2 battery - 51 Battalion\n one MRL battery - 32 Battalion\n one MRL battery - 4 Artillery Regiment\n one 120 mm mortar battery - 4 Artillery Regiment\n one 120 mm mortar battery - 18 Light Artillery Regiment Parachute Brigade\n two meteorological sections\n Reserves\n HQ elements from 71 Motorised Brigade\n HQ elements from 8th Armoured Division (South Africa)\n HQ elements from 44 Parachute Brigade\n one G-5 battery - based in SE Angola\n one G-2 battery - 71 Motorised Brigade\n 8 Maintenance Unit\n 30 Corps Maintenance Unit\n two 32mm anti aircraft batteries\n one provost platoon\n\n10 SA Division (Operation Prone) - Brigadier Chris SerfonteinTask Force X-ray - Colonel Leon Marais\n 53 Battalion\n 54 Battalion\n 4 SAI Battalion\n one combat wing - 101 Battalion\n 17 Field Regiment HQ\n one G5 battery - 4 SAI\n one G2 battery - 17 Field Regiment\n one MRL battery - 17 Field Regiment\n one AA battery - Regiment VaalriverTask Force Zulu - Colonel Mucho Delport\n 51 Battalion\n 52 Battalion\n 102 Battalion\n 32 Battalion\n 61 Mechanised Battalion incl. one tank squadron\n one combat wing - 101 Battalion\n 14 Artillery Regiment HQ\n one G2 battery - Transvaal State Artillery Regiment\n one 35mm AA troop - Regiment Orange Free State\n two 20mm AA troops - Regiment Eastern TransvaalTask Force Yankee - Colonel Jan Lusse\n HQ 81 Armour Brigade\n HQ 10 Artillery Brigade\n one tank regiment (less one tank squadron) - 81 Armour Brigade\n one mechanized infantry company - 81 Armour Brigade\n one armoured car squadron - Light Horse Regiment|2 Light Horse Regiment\n two armoured car squadrons - 1 & 2 Special Service Battalion\n one 120mm mortar battery - 4 Artillery RegimentTask Force Whiskey all counter-insurgency units from Tsumeb/Grootfontein/Otavi10 Artillery Regiment - Colonel Jean Lausberg\n\nCuban forces50th Division''' - Brigadier General Patricio de la Guardia Font\n three special forces battalions - Cuban SPETSNAZ\n three tank battalions - Cuban tank regiment (105-110 tanks)\n one artillery regiment - Cuban regiment\n six infantry regiments - Cuban and Angolan soldiers (1500-2000 men each plus tanks)\n three raiding battalions - Cuban and SWAPO soldiers (200 Cuban + 250 SWAPO each)\n Missile air defence batteries, air force helicopters and aircraft\n\nInitial clashes\nWith the Cuban movements southwards and continuing SADF/South West African Territorial Force operations against SWAPO in the same area, both forces would soon come into contact with each other.  On 18 April 1988, a SWATF unit, 101 Battalion, chasing a SWAPO unit was ambushed by Cuban elements from Xangongo near Chipeque. The battle ended with the South Africans losing two men and eleven wounded. Thereafter the Cubans continued patrolling southwards from Xangongo towards the SADF garrison at Calueque.\n\nOn 2 May 1988, SAAF Mirages attacked FAPLA positions south of Techipa. The Cubans, fearing a South African advance, retaliated and planned another ambush.\n\nDuring the first round tripartite talks in London on the 3 May 1988, behind the scene talks between the military contingents of Cuba and South Africa was tense. The Cubans threatened to invade SWA/Namibia if the South Africans did not agree to the Cuban proposals while the South African indicated if they tried, it would be Cuba's darkest day. The talks ended the following day.\n\nThe Cuban ambush site was in position by 4 May 1988 less than 2 km south of Donguena. A SADF unit, the 101 Battalion, with twenty Casspirs and two trucks had been sent forward to occupy Donguena. They ran into the ambush with Cubans destroying or damaging four Casspirs. The South Africans withdrew at dusk having lost seven men and one captured, Sergeant Johan Papenfus and failed to retrieve the fourth Casspir and its equipment. The Cubans were said to have lost forty-five soldiers. Later that evening, a further three companies from 201 and 101 Battalions were sent forward to capture Donguena, but with Cuban tank positions south of the town, withdrew. The Cuban later withdrew the same evening.\n\nOn 12 May 1988, the 32 Battalion commander was called to a meeting in Oshakati to discuss a plan for the unit to attack SWAPO units at Techipa. The commander persuaded the planners to reconnoitre the area first before attacking. On 16 May, two reconnaissance units were airlifted to an area south of Techipa and while the second landed close to Xangongo but on the western side of the Cunene River. The first team was unable to get close to Techipa while the second team found tank tracks on all roads showing extensive patrolling of the area. The first team was sent back in from the north of Techipa by vehicle, finding extensive trench systems around the town reminiscent of the same layered system around Cuito Cuanavale with vehicles, generators and radar systems and outposts at further distances south of the town. A decision was then made to establish a new task force but it would only be in operation by early June, with a specific aim of protecting the water scheme at Calueque. In the meantime, three companies of 32 Battalion would hold the line until the task force was operational and would continue to patrol and reconnoitre the area south of Techipa.\n\nAn ambush by 32 Battalion was planned for 22 May 1988. The plan called for a mortar attack on an outpost south of Techipa which would draw out the Cubans who would be then ambushed. Members of 32 Battalion company ambushed a Cuban de-mining team before the mortaring began and then found themselves being attacked by four BRDM-2 armoured personnel carriers and from two other hidden outposts. Fleeing back to the mortar position under covering mortar fire, the Cubans finally caught up and attacked with the BRDM's resulting in the abandonment of three damaged Unimogs. The 32 Battalion company retreated again as BM-21s started shelling. The Cubans eventually gave up the chase and the company was able to return to the mortar position in search of the missing vehicles but these had been removed by the Cubans. The remaining missing 32 Battalion members turned up at Ruacana and Calueque the following day.\n\nFollowing the bungled ambush of the 22 May, the Cubans analysed the intelligence gathered from the captured SADF vehicles. Cuban intelligence concluded that the South African were planning a major attack on Techipa which was not the case.\n\nJune 1988 was spent reinforcing the defences around Techipa with consisted of minefields, bunkers and anti-tank barriers which had been employed successfully to slow down the SADF and UNITA forces around Cuito Cuanavale during Operation Packer. There was also a build-up of Cuban forces around the town and aggressive patrolling by SWAPO and FAPLA forces to establish the positions of the South African forces.\n\nCuban attack planning\nAt the same time, Castro planned an operation consisting of two parts.\n The first, a two-pronged attack, one from Xangongo to capture Cuamato, then a three column advance from Techipa to capture Calueque joined later by the forces that had captured Cuamato. \n The second part of the plan was an air attack on Ruacana if Techipa was attacked by the SAAF. Castro also notified the Angolan and Soviets of his plan.\n\n10 SA Division formed\nBy the 27 May 1988, Brigadier Chris Serfontein was appointed 10 SA Division commander while Colonel Roland de Vries was appointed his chief of staff.\n\nOn the 30 May/1 June, operational instructions for Operation Hilti (to be renamed Operation Prone later) was released to the planners by SADF HQ. The instructions required the development of a conventional and counterinsurgency plan for north-west South-West Africa and south-western Angola.\n\nThe instructions called for a sub-phase called Operation Excite to gain military control of south-west Angola by August 1988.\n\nFollowing Operation Excite, Operation Faction, restoration of SADF influence over 21 days in the area of dispute. And finally Operation Florentine, the installation of UNITA in the area of dispute and to support them against a FAPLA and Cuban attempts to retake the area.\n\nThis plan would make use of the 10 SA Division, as well as elements of the SA Air Force, the SA Navy operating off the Angolan coast and the insertion of SA special forces deep in the FAPLA/Cuban rear.\n\nTo counter the immediate threat of the Cuban advance to the South-West African border, the 10 SA Division planning team moved to South-West Africa on the 7 June 1988 to the operational headquarters at Oshakati and worked on the plan until 17 June.\n\nSouth African Citizen Force Mobilization\nPart of this plan would become Operation Excite/Hilti. After a visit to SWA/Namibia, General Jannie Geldenhuys spoke to journalists on 8 June, announcing the Cubans build-up and their advance to the border region around Ruacana and the call-up of SADF conventional forces made up of citizen reserves.\n\nThe call-up was said to be around 140,000 men and was hoped the announcement would send a message to the Cubans to end their advance to the SWA/Namibian border.The Call-up would begin on 21 July and be completed by 25 July with movement to SWA/Namibia taking place between the 26 and 31 July.\n\nBattle training would be completed by 21 August with the units ready to be deployed for action into Southern Angola by the 24 August.\n\nClashes continue\nBy 13 June 1988, the new South African Task Force planned in May, was now in operation under the command of Colonel Mucho Delport with SADF forces in place east of the Cunene River, south of Xangongo, and around Cuamato and Calueque. Other SADF forces were positioned west of the Cunene River, with placements around and to the north-west of Calueque and Ruacana. The Task Force's headquarters was at Ruacana.\n\nOn 18 June, G-2 and G-5 batteries were in position and ready for use by the Task Force. These were used to shell the Cuban positions. On 22 June, a company from 32 Battalion clashed with a Cuban unit with tanks and infantry. They were able to break off contact with the Cubans after assistance from SADF artillery.\n\nOn the 23 June, reconnaissance units and members of 32 Battalion spotted three Cuban columns moving southwards from Techipa towards Calueque, with this stop-start advance continuing until the 26 June.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cubans and FAPLA forces advanced from Xangongo on 24 June, the first prong of their plan and attacked the SADF units at Cuamato. 201 Battalion with additional elements of Ratels and mortars stopped the advanced and occupation of the town and the Cubans retreated back to Xangongo. The South African lost a few vehicles and remained in the town.\n\nNegotiations continue\nAt the same time the Cubans, Angolan's and South Africans met in Cairo on 24 June for a second round of tripartite talks. The two-day meeting was led by the Americans with a Soviet delegation in attendance. The meeting was fiery with the Soviets pulling the Cuban delegation back into line and all that was agreed was that the concept of linkage, a South African pull-out of Angola followed by the Cubans, was the only option for a future agreement.\n\nOperation Excite\nBy 26 June 1988, a 32 Battalion company was moved into position to provide early warning of the Cuban tanks and columns advancing from Techipa while 61 Mechanised Battalion was brought in behind them to intercept when required. Using their MRL's and artillery they hindered and slowed the Cuban advance. Four Ratel ZT3 anti-tank missile units had also arrived at 61 Mechanised Battalion positions. The evening of 26 June, SADF reconnaissance discovered SA-6 launchers around Techipa. Using a ruse of releasing meteorological balloons with aluminium strips attached to them, the Cubans fired their SA-6's narrowing down their location for the SADF reconnaissance units, and the South Africans counterattacked with G-5 artillery destroying them and after four hours other Cuban artillery.\n\nOn the morning of the 27 June 1988, the Cuban columns began to move again. Elements of 32 Battalion that were monitoring the column were unable to make contact with 61 Mechanised Battalion to warn them about the advancing Cubans. 61 Mechanised Battalion and their tanks begun moving at the same time to find a better position than the night lager and when advancing over a low ridge, ran into a forward Cuban units ambush. The leading Ratel was hit by a RPG and during the battle, four further Ratels were damaged losing one soldier and a further three wounded. 61 Mechanised called in artillery fire as Cuban reinforcements arrived to support the ambush unit.\n\nDuring the heavy fighting that followed this South African battalion destroyed a tank, a BTR-60, many trucks and inflicted heavy casualties on the Cuban infantry forcing them to withdraw. During the battle, 32 Battalion eventually made contact with 61 Mechanised, informing them that Cuban tanks were on their way. 61 Mechanised released their tanks and sent them to intercept the Cuban tanks. The SADF tanks made contact and after half an hour had stopped the advance destroying another T-55 tank, trucks and a BTR-60. The Cubans were forced to withdraw again. Spotting the advance of two Cuban columns, Commandant Mike Muller withdrew his forces southwards towards Calueque attacking one column and then the other with G-5 artillery. Both columns were halted.\n\nCuban air attack\nAround 1pm, twelve Cuban MiG-23's based at Lubango and Cahama, flying at tree height to Ruacana, were spotted by SADF units but were unable to signal an air attack fast enough as the planes turned and headed to attack the hydroelectric dam at Calueque. Two bombed the bridge over the Cunene River and destroyed it, damaged the sluice gates while another two bombed the power plant and engine rooms. A fifth plane bombed the water irrigation pipeline to Ovambo, destroying it. One of those bombs from the fifth plane exploded between a Buffel and Eland 90 killing eleven SADF soldiers on ammunition escort duty. Two Cuban planes were hit by 20 mm AA guns and one crashed on its way back to its base in Angola.\n\nThe South African soldiers retreated towards the SWA/Namibian border, crossing in the late afternoon. As described above, the air attack part of the Cuban operation went ahead but their ground forces retreated back to Techipa after the clash.\n\nUndeclared peace\nFearing a revenge attack by the SADF, the Cubans implemented plans that included possible attacks on SWA/Namibia itself. These plans were scrapped when no retaliation occurred from the South Africans.\n\nWhat followed the hostilities at Calueque was an undeclared ceasefire. The South African public was shocked by the deaths at Calueque and the government ordered a scaling back of operations.\n\nBattle Group 20 whom with UNITA, guarding the minefields east of the Cuito River across from Cuito Cuanavale, were ordered to withdraw personnel and equipment so as not to take casualties and prevent any further SADF personnel becoming prisoners of war.\n\nUNITA was informed, with some regarding this withdrawal as an act of  betrayal. Orders were to ensure no Cubans advance any further than where they were currently positioned.\n\nTalks continue\nBy 10 July, the Cubans and South Africans were back at the negotiation table in New York City for three days.\n\nThe Cubans surprised the South African delegation by proposing an honourable Cuban withdrawal from Angola linked to the implementation of UN Resolution 435 and the ending of support to SWAPO and UNITA. This proposal became known as the New York Principle though the detail in the proposal would be negotiated at a later date.\n\nThe parties met again in the Cape Verde on the 22 July for the fourth round of talks but all that was agreed on was the proposal to set up a Joint Monitoring Commission.\n\nModified planning\nFollowing the clashes at the end of June 1988, the South African politicians and the military re-evaluated the SADF's role in the operational area. What was considered was the change in the military balance brought about by the Cuban division, the reluctance of the South African public to accept high casualties, the political direction towards the ending of Apartheid, and the international push to end South Africa's control of SWA/Namibia.\n\nNew South African Military Plan\nOn 19 July 1988 planning was finalised and Operation Hilti was changed to Operation Prone and the new plan became the defence of SWA/Namibia.\n\nThis plan was divided into sub-operations, Operation Linger and Operation Faction (renamed Operation Pact).\n\n Operation Linger became the counterinsurgency plan against SWAPO incursions in SWA and bases in Angola.\n Operation Faction (Pact) was the conventional plan that would defend SWA against a Cuban invasion across the border and the destruction of the remainder of the enemy in Angola with a possible offensive action.\n\nOperation Pact was further divided into three phases.\n\nThe first phase was to deceive the Cubans as to the intentions and disposition of the South African forces, the preparation of the SADF forces, assist in countering any SWAPO raids, and use of the recces to track the movement and disposition of the Cuban forces.\nPhase two would occur when the Cubans invaded SWA/Namibia, drawing them into areas of SADF control, halting and destroying the Cubans.\nThe third phase would occur if phase two failed, a delaying retreat by SADF forces to an area around Tsumeb and the final destruction of the remaining Cuban forces.\n\nAirborne assault plan\nThe South Africans also planned for an attack on the Angolan port of Namibe (today Moçâmedes). This port was the main logistical entrance for Cuban and FAPLA supplies to the Cuban 50th Division. The plan was developed by Commandant McGill Alexander of 44 Parachute Brigade, a veteran of Operation Reindeer. This operation would last 72 hours with the objective being the destruction of the port's logistical capacity; the harbour and railway facilities and the railway line. The SADF would make use of the navy, air force, paratroopers and special forces. The plan called for approximately 1,200 men, half as an airborne drop and the rest by means of an amphibious assault backed by navy strike craft. The plan was tested during Exercise Magersfontein at Walvis Bay.\n\nPeace talks\nRound five of the Tripartite talks began on 2 August 1988 in Geneva, Switzerland. The Soviets joined the meeting in an observer role.  The South Africans opened the negotiations with several proposals: \na ceasefire to begin on 10 August 1988, \nredeployment of South African and Cuban forces in Angola by 1 September 1988, \nimplementation of UN Resolution 435 and all foreign forces leave Angola by 1 June 1989.\n\nThe 1 June 1989 proposal angered the Cuban and Angolans and the talks continued discussing the first three South African proposals. With the assistance of the Soviets, the American were able to get the Cubans, Angolans and South Africans to sign the Geneva Protocol on 5 August 1988. The protocol set the following dates:\n\n 10 August 1988 – South Africans to begin withdrawal from Angola\n 1 September 1988 – South Africans complete the withdrawal\n 10 September 1988 – Peace settlement signed\n 1 November 1988 – Implementation of UN Resolution 435\n\nWhat was not agreed upon was the Cuban withdrawal from Angola. This would be negotiated at another meeting in the near future. Nor were SWAPO or UNITA party to the agreement.\n\nCeasefire\nOn 8 August 1988, the South Africans, Angolans and Cubans announced a ceasefire in Angola and SWA/Namibia.\n\nA line was drawn from Chitado, Ruacana, Calueque, Naulili, Cuamato and Chitado that the Cubans would stay north of and would guarantee the water irrigation supply from Ruacana to SWA/Namibia.\n\nSWAPO, not party to the agreement, said it would honour the ceasefire on 1 September if South Africa did so, but this did not happen and SWAPO activities continued.\n\nUNITA on the other hand stated that it would ignore the ceasefire and would continue to fight the Angolan government. It did however state that it wished to stop fighting if the Angolan government held talks with them or ceased attacking them and seek national reconciliation.\n\nSouth African withdrawal from Angola\n10 August 1988 saw the South African government announce the beginnings of a troop withdrawal from southern Angola, with the final day for withdrawal of SADF personnel set for 1 September.\n\nBattle Group 20, the only SADF force in south-eastern Angola, had been assisting UNITA to maintain the siege of Cuito Cuanavale after the end of Operation Packer. This withdrawal by Battle Group 20 southwards was part of Operation Displace.\n\nBy 16 August the Joint Monitoring Commission was formed at Ruacana. This Joint Monitoring Commission finalised the terms of the ceasefire by the 22 August and the formal ceasefire was signed between three parties. Major General Willie Meyer represented South Africa, General Leopoldo Frias from Cuba and Angola by Colonel Antonio Jose.\n\nThe SADF elements arrived at the Angolan/SWA/Namibian border with ten days to spare and had to wait around as the Joint Monitoring Commission and world media organised themselves for the crossover at Rundu at a temporary steel bridge that was to take place on 1 September. On 30 August 1988, the last of the South African troops crossed a temporary steel bridge into SWA/Namibia watched by the world's media and the Joint Monitoring Commission, 36 hours early than the planned time. A convoy of fifty vehicles with around thousand soldiers crossed over singing battle songs. After officers of the three countries walked across the bridge, the South African sappers begun to dismantle the temporary steel bridge.\n\nThe Joint Monitoring Commission then declared on 30 August 1988, that the South African Defence Force had now left Angola.\n\nAftermath\nOn the 1 September 1988, the SADF disbanded its 10 SA Division and the Citizen Force units were returned to South Africa.\n\nSouth African Military Contingency Plan\nPlanning however continued for Operation Prone in case further peace negotiation's failed to agree to the linkage of the implementation of UN Resolution 435 to the Cuban withdrawal from Angola.\n\nTripartite Accord\nNine more rounds of negotiations followed revolving around the dates for the Cuban withdrawal from Angola that finally ended with an agreement called the Tripartite Accord signed on 22 December in New York. This accord finalised the dates of the Cuban staggered withdrawals from Angola and the implementation of UN Resolution 435 on 1 April 1989.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nConflicts in 1988\nMilitary history of Angola\nBattles and operations of the South African Border War\n1988 in Angola\n1988 in South Africa"}

{"id": "4103800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo%20Toolkit", "title": "Dojo Toolkit", "text": "Dojo Toolkit (stylized as dōjō toolkit) is an open-source modular JavaScript library (or more specifically JavaScript toolkit) designed to ease the rapid development of cross-platform, JavaScript/Ajax-based applications and web sites. It was started by Alex Russell, Dylan Schiemann, David Schontzler, and others in 2004 and is dual-licensed under the modified BSD license or the Academic Free License (≥ 2.1).\n\nThe Dojo Foundation was a non-profit organization created with the goal to promote the adoption of the toolkit. In 2016, the foundation merged with jQuery Foundation to become JS Foundation.\n\nOverview\n\nDojo is a JavaScript framework targeting the many needs of large-scale client-side web development. For example, Dojo abstracts the differences among diverse browsers to provide APIs that will work on all of them (it can even run on the server under Node.js); it establishes a framework for defining modules of code and managing their interdependencies; it provides build tools for optimizing JavaScript and CSS, generating documentation, and unit testing; it supports internationalization, localization, and accessibility; and it provides a rich suite of commonly needed utility classes and user-interface widgets.\n\nDojo is completely open source. The toolkit includes about three thousand JavaScript modules, in addition to images and other resources.\n\nThe Dojo Toolkit is organized in several parts:\n dojo contains the core and most non-visual modules. \n dijit is a library of user-interface modules for widgets and layout.\n dojox holds assorted modules not yet considered stable enough to include in dojo or dijit.\n util includes build tools such as optimization, documentation, style-checking, and testing.\n\nFeatures\n\nWidgets\n\nDojo widgets are components — comprising JavaScript code, HTML markup, and CSS style declarations — that provide multi-browser (not to be confused with cross-browser), interactive features:\n\n Menus, tabs, and tooltips\n Sortable tables\n Dynamic charts\n 2D vector drawings\n Animated effects—fades, wipes and slides—facilities for custom animation effects\n\nAsynchronous communication\n\nOne important feature of Ajax applications is asynchronous communication of the browser with the server: information is exchanged and the page's presentation is updated without a need for reloading the whole page. Traditionally, this is done with the JavaScript object XMLHttpRequest. Dojo provides an abstracted wrapper (dojo.xhr) around various web browsers' implementations of XMLHttpRequest, and dojo.io also supports other transports (such as hidden IFrames) and a variety of data formats. Using this approach, it is easy to have the data a user enters into a form sent to the server \"behind the scenes\"; the server can then reply with some JavaScript code that updates the presentation of the page.\n\nPackaging system\n\nDojo provides a packaging system to facilitate modular development of functionality in individual packages and sub-packages; the base Dojo \"bootstrap\" script initializes a set of hierarchical package namespaces — \"io\", \"event\", etc. — under a root \"dojo\" namespace. After initialization of the root namespace, any Dojo package can be loaded (via XMLHttpRequest or other similar transport) by using utility functions supplied in the bootstrap. It is also possible to initialize additional namespaces within or parallel to the \"dojo\" namespace, allowing extensions of Dojo or the development of private Dojo-managed namespaces for third-party libraries and applications. \n\nDojo packages can consist of multiple files and can specify which files constitute the entire package. Any package or file can also specify a dependency on other packages or files; when the package is loaded, any dependencies it specifies will also be loaded.\n\nWorkarounds for cross-domain loading of most Dojo packages are provided (though this requires a specialized build of Dojo).\n\nDojo also provides a mechanism for building \"profiles\"; the build system takes as input a list of packages, and uses Rhino to create a single compressed JavaScript file containing those packages and all their dependencies. This allows all necessary code to be loaded and initialized at once, and permits caching of the code (most web browsers do not cache files loaded via XMLHttpRequest). Pre-built profiles for some common use cases are available for download from the same location as the full toolkit.\n\nClient-side data storage\n\nIn addition to providing support functions for reading and writing cookies, Dojo formerly supported a local, client-side storage abstraction named Dojo Storage. Dojo Storage allows web applications to store data on the client-side, persistently and securely and with a user's permission. It works across existing web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari. When included in a web page, Dojo Storage determines the best method for persistently storing information. Firefox 2 uses native browser persistence; on other browsers, it uses a hidden Flash applet. With Flash 6+ being installed on about 95% of computers connected to the web, this makes the storage mechanism accessible for much of the web's installed base. For a web application loaded from the file system, i.e., from a file:// URL, Dojo Storage will transparently use XPCOM on Firefox and ActiveX on Internet Explorer to persist information. The programmer using Dojo Storage is abstracted from the storage mechanism used and is presented with a simple hash table abstraction, with methods such as put() and get().\nDojo Storage is not supported in versions later than the 1.3 release.\n\nServer-side data storage\n\nAs of January 2007, Dojo includes the following example server-side datastore implementations in the dojo.data namespace:\n\n CsvStore: a read-only store that reads tabular data from comma-separated values files\n OpmlStore: a read-only store that reads hierarchical data from OPML format files\n YahooStore: a read-only store that fetches search results from the Yahoo! Search web service\n DeliciousStore: a read-only store that fetches bookmarks from the del.icio.us web service\n RdfStore: a read-write store that uses SPARQL to talk to RDF data servers including, for example, the Rhizome RDF application server.\n\nSupport for Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR)\n\nDojo can be used in JavaScript-based Adobe AIR applications. It has been modified to meet AIR's security requirements.\n\nSitePen, a Dojo consulting company, has made an Adobe AIR application called \"Dojo Toolbox\" using Dojo. It includes an API viewer and a GUI to Dojo's build system. Normally, the build system is run from within Rhino, but in this AIR application the build system can be run from AIR, without the use of Java.\n\nCriticisms\n\nLoading\n\nEarlier versions of Dojo had a reputation for being bulky and slow to load. It also required extra work to load Dojo across domains, e.g., from a CDN. Addressing these problems was the major goal of Dojo 1.7, which introduced asynchronous module definition (AMD) and a \"nano\" loader.\n\nDocumentation\n\nDojo has long been criticized for its incomplete, scattered, and outdated documentation. Recognizing this, the developers made huge improvements in the documentation for the 1.8 release, including new tutorials, an API browser, filling in the missing pieces, and updating most examples to AMD style.\n\nA number of books have been written about Dojo, but all based upon Dojo 1.3 or earlier, now several years out of date. Since these predate AMD support and its accompanying reorganization, examples in these books almost invariably rely on things that are now deprecated and no longer best practice.

{"id": "4103816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Other%20Campaign", "title": "The Other Campaign", "text": "The Other Campaign () is a political program by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation for the recognition and protection of indigenous rights and autonomy in Mexico.  This program began in January 2006, and sent Subcomandante Marcos, the main spokesperson for the campaign, to travel across Mexico for several months. This tour was intended to create connections among the Zapatistas and pre-existing resistance groups throughout Mexico.\n\nThroughout the campaign, the Zapatistas met with a diverse number of groups and organizations, such as trade union organizers, indigenous leaders, intellectuals, feminists and women's rights activists, LGBT people, advocates for human rights, students, environmental activists, fishermen, factory workers, natural disaster victims, peasants, teachers, prostitutes, and young people. Marcos said that the goal of the campaign is \"not to speak or run for office, but 'to listen to the simple and humble people who struggle'.\"  This united force was conceived to fight against neoliberalism and capitalism. The Zapatistas hoped to eliminate these practices in the Mexican federal government in order to protect the livelihoods of those citizens who are exploited economically by these institutions. Based on the Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle, the Other Campaign's ultimate goal was to force the Mexican government to agree to a convention which would rewrite the national constitution to include protection of indigenous rights and autonomy and exclude elements of neoliberal capitalism.\n\nHistorical context \nThe Other Campaign emerged from a 12-year-long struggle for indigenous rights, known as the Zapatista Movement or Zapatismo. This movement began on January 1, 1994 with an uprising in Chiapas, Mexico to protest the North American Free Trade Agreement and fight for the recognition and protection of rights for the indigenous people of Mexico. The movement fought the Mexican government to end such problems as financial exploitation of natives and for the recognition of racial, ethnic, and gender differences among Mexican citizens. Throughout their existence as a political force, the Zapatistas have published a series of declarations to announce the movement's objectives, in accordance with traditional peasant and indigenous revolts in 19th-century Mexico. In 1996, the Zapatistas organized a series of peace talks with the Mexican federal government, focusing initially on culture and indigenous civil rights. These negotiations led to the signing of the San Andrés Agreements, also known as the San Andrés Accords, on February 16, 1996. But in August 2001, the Mexican government defied the terms of the San Andrés Agreements when the Mexican Congress enacted constitutional reforms that had a detrimental effect on indigenous rights.\n\nIn response to this defiance, in June, 2005 the Zapatistas released the Sixth Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle (also known as La Sexta in Spanish), the most recent of the movement's declarations of objectives. The declaration outlined several goals, and announced that the Zapatistas intend to remain both a political and military force in Mexico. The declaration describes the need for a new political party, independent from the parties of the Mexican Left and all other preexisting political parties. The Sixth Declaration also encourages an international fight against neoliberalism.\n\nTo accomplish the Sixth Declaration's goal of forming a new political force, the Zapatistas invited hundreds of organizations, political activists, leaders, and average citizens to meet and discuss strategies for gaining the support of resistance groups around the country. The result of the debates and organizational progress made during these meetings was the initiative known as the Other Campaign.\n\nCampaign\nThe Other Campaign began as an idea devised by the Zapatistas to travel throughout Mexico to meet other resistance groups and learn about the struggles they face in their communities and rally support against the neoliberal and capitalistic federal political system. Although this process resembles a conventional election campaign, the goal was not to elect a candidate to public office, but to create a new kind of political force that presents a different way to conduct political business during election campaigns.\n\nThe first meeting to discuss the organization, structure, and politics of the Other Campaign was held on September 16–18, 2005. Over 2,000 people participated in this two-day event. Their experience with activism ranged from none, to post-1994 Zapatismo activist experience, to activism in the 1970s. The participants had very diverse backgrounds, including union organizers, indigenous leaders, intellectuals, feminists and women's rights activists, gays, lesbians, advocates for human rights, students, environmental activists, and teachers. Urban youth collectives and nongovernmental organizations were also represented at this event. Despite this obvious diversity and the Zapatistas' 12-year long struggle for indigenous rights, the speakers at the conference rarely mentioned the necessity of equal involvement in the campaign in terms of gender, racial-ethnic group, and sexual orientation. Rather than incorporating these important issues into discussions of all aspects of the Other Campaign, they were confined to one section of the agenda, \"A Special Place for Differences\", drawing criticism from gay, lesbian, indigenous, and feminist organizations attending the event. Despite this internal criticism, the event continued its efforts to organize the campaign.\n\nIn January, 2006, the Other Campaign launched with Subcomandante Marcos, also known as Delegado Cero, traveling for several months around all 31 Mexican states. Marcos gave speeches which were attended by people as diverse as the collaborators from the campaign's first meeting, including fishermen, factory workers, natural disaster victims, peasants, teachers, gays, lesbians, prostitutes, and young people. The ultimate goal of this tour was to rally support from organizations throughout the nation in order to eradicate neoliberalism and capitalism from the political system in Mexico. The ideal achievement of this goal included pressuring the Mexican government to create a convention to rewrite the nation's constitution to protect all Mexicans from the exploitation that results from current capitalist and neoliberal practices.\n\nIn May 2014, Rafael Guillén Vicente, the individual behind the persona and nom de guerre \"Subcomandante Marcos\", announced that he was retiring that persona and stepping down from his leadership role. He stated: \"We are warriors and as such we know our role and our time. Marcos, the character is no longer necessary... His character was created and now his creators, the Zapatistas, are destroying him.\" He signed this statement off with \"My name is Galeano. Rebel Subcomandante Galeano\", signalling the adoption of a new persona.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links \n The Other Campaign EZLN (Official site in spanish)\n  The Other Journalism With The Other Campaign\n The Other Campaign: A Visual Record of the Zapatistas and Mexico 2006\n At a 60's Style Be-In, Guns Yield to Words, Lots of Words by The New York Times, August 31, 2005\n\nZapatista Army of National Liberation\n2006 in Mexico\n2006 in Mexican politics"}

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 12 October 1972 by Barrie & Jenkins, and in the United States on 6 August 1973 by Simon & Schuster, Inc. under the title The Plot That Thickened. Although written towards the end of the Wodehouse's life, and published 37 years after The Luck of the Bodkins (1935), the events of book follow on directly from those recounted in the earlier novel.\n\nMonty Bodkin returns from Hollywood, with his romantic situation, previously recounted in Heavy Weather (1933) and The Luck of the Bodkins (1935), still as complicated as ever. Other recurring Wodehouse characters also appear, including the film studio president Ivor Llewellyn, the crook Alexander \"Chimp\" Twist, and Chimp's rivals Soapy and Dolly Molloy. Llewellyn was to return a year later in Bachelors Anonymous (1973).\n\nPlot \nMonty Bodkin's fiancée Gertrude Butterwick refuses to marry without the consent of her father J. B. Butterwick. He dislikes Monty and will not agree to the match unless Monty can remain gainfully employed for a full year. Having spent a year working as a production advisor for the Superba-Llewellyn Motion Picture Corporation in Hollywood, Monty now returns to England. However, Butterwick insists that the job did not count because Monty got it (in The Luck of the Bodkins) through dishonest means.\n\nTo appease Butterwick, Monty seeks another paid position. Sally Miller (secretly in love with Monty) falsely tells her employer Grayce Llewellyn that Monty comes from an aristocratic family, and Grayce appoints Monty as secretary to her husband, Ivor Llewellyn, who is now in England. Monty is to work at the Llewellyns' newly rented country house, Mellingham Hall in Sussex, where Llewellyn is writing a history of his film studio.\n\nThe domineering Grayce watches Llewellyn's spending closely to prevent him from gambling. He had previously acquired secret funds by selling Grayce's valuable pearl necklace without her knowledge and replacing it with a fake. Now he obtains more by borrowing from Monty.\n\nWhile Grayce is away, Llewellyn goes to an illegal nightclub with Monty and Sally. When the club is raided by the police, Sally helps the party to escape by pulling a dustbin over the head of a plainclothes policeman, Wilfred Chisholm. This valiant action causes Monty to fall in love with Sally. Unknown to them, Chisholm has over the past year become attracted to Gertrude, and would like to marry her. Although attracted to him, she feels she cannot break her engagement with Monty.\n\nGrayce is worried about the security of her valuable necklace, and employs a private detective, J. Sheringham Adair, to watch over it. He agrees to come to the house posing as Llewellyn's new valet. Unknown to Grayce, Adair is an alias of Chimp Twist, a crook. Also visiting the house are the Llewellyns' new acquaintances Soapy and Dolly Molloy, who are actually professional criminals. Grayce's daughter Mavis plans to visit, bringing her new fiancé Jimmy Ponder. This worries Llewellyn, as Ponder is a jewellery expert who will realize that Grayce's necklace is not genuine.\n\nWhen Monty is mistaken for a burglar, Grayce decides to lodge the pearls at a local bank for safekeeping. To avoid the necklace being exposed as a fake, Llewellyn asks Monty to drive it to the bank, and to pretend that it had been stolen on the way by an unknown robber. Monty agrees to the deception. As Monty is leaving, Dolly asks him for a lift into town and as they near their destination she takes him by surprise, pulling a gun and demanding the necklace. Both are then surprised by Chimp, who has been hiding in the back seat of the car, and who also has a gun. Chimp takes the necklace and drives off, leaving Monty and Dolly to walk back to the Hall. Monty tells Dolly that the necklace is fake, a fact which Chimp will soon discover.\n\nButterwick is still trying to prevent Monty marrying his daughter. Learning that Grayce had hired Monty only because of his supposed aristocratic connections, he sets her straight, hoping that she will sack Monty. Meanwhile, Chisholm tells Gertrude of Monty's nightclub escapade, and that he had been visiting the club in the company of a girl.\n\nMonty receives a telegram from Gertrude to announce that she is breaking off the engagement. This allows Monty to become engaged to Sally, and Gertrude to become engaged to Chisholm. Grayce announces her intention to get a divorce, an event which Llewellyn – who has already been divorced four times – regards as purely routine.\n\nCharacters\n Montrose \"Monty\" Bodkin – Amiable and rich Drone engaged to Gertrude, employed as a production advisor and then secretary to Ivor Llewellyn\n Alexandra \"Sally\" Miller – Secretary to Monty in Hollywood and later to Grayce Llewellyn in Sussex; in love with Monty\n Gertrude Butterwick – Monty's fiancée\nJ.

{"id": "4103837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant%20Wilson", "title": "Sergeant Wilson", "text": "Sergeant Arthur Wilson is a fictional Home Guard platoon sergeant and bank chief clerk, first portrayed by John Le Mesurier in the BBC television sitcom Dad's Army.\n\nBackground \nWilson was born in 1887, and is carefree, cheerful and well-spoken, although more complex than he first seems. He is chief clerk of the Walmington-on-Sea bank and captain of the cricket club. He has an upper-middle-class background; his uncle was a peer of the realm, his father had a career in the City of London, and Wilson often recalls fond memories of his nanny. He was educated at a public school named Meadow Bridge, having failed the entrance exam for Harrow. He was destined for the Indian Civil Service but failed that exam too. The final episode reveals Wilson to have reached the rank of captain in the Middlesex Regiment whilst serving in the First World War.\n\nCaptain Mainwaring, Wilson's senior in the Home Guard and in the bank, envies and resents Wilson's privileged background and once compared Wilson with Peter Pan, because he could never face responsibilities. These include Private Pike, who worships his \"Uncle Arthur\" but may be Wilson's son – Wilson has had a long relationship with Mavis Pike, Pike's widowed mother. It is gossip in Walmington-on-Sea, as both arrived in Walmington from Weston-super-Mare around the same time, and there are other \"coincidences\" that show Wilson and Mrs Pike are more than just close friends, such as them unofficially living together. He admits that Pike originally called him Daddy, until told to call him Uncle (although the writers have confirmed that Wilson is Pike's biological father). In \"Menace from the Deep\" Jones brushes against Wilson while he is asleep, and he says without fully waking \"Gently, Mavis\".\n\nAlthough Wilson is shown to have a very flirtatious nature, and Mrs Pike has on occasion been seen out with other men (such as Warden Hodges, or the dashing American Army soldiers that arrived in Walmington-on-Sea), their relationship seems to be enduring, with both Wilson and Mrs Pike expressing sincere distress during the various times when they believe the other has left them for someone else.\n\nIn \"Getting the Bird\" it is revealed that Wilson has an adult daughter from an early marriage whom he paid to attend a good school and who is serving during the war in the Women's Royal Naval Service. He admits to Fraser that he does not see his daughter as much as he would like, but it is clear that father and daughter love each other deeply. In \"Sgt. Wilson's Little Secret\" a misunderstanding leads to him nearly marrying Mrs Pike (indicating that he has divorced his previous wife) but he apparently calls it off at the last moment. There remain loose ends about Wilson's personal life, e.g. he may avoid marrying Mrs Pike because he does not want his previous marriage to become known, or he may never have been divorced from his wife, meaning a marriage to Mrs Pike would be bigamous.\n\nIn the post-war radio sequel It Sticks Out Half a Mile, Wilson claims to be 54 years old, and born in 1894.  The radio sequel also reveals that he did become the manager of Swallows bank at Walmington-on-Sea in 1947. It also reveals that Mrs Pike moved over to the same location when Wilson is transferred.\n\nPersonality \nWilson has a vague and dreamy personality and an aura of mystery. In appearance, he resembles Anthony Eden, and in the episode \"Ring Dem Bells\" loves to be told of his supposed resemblance to the actor Jack Buchanan (and is mocked for doing so by Mainwaring in the episode \"The Love of Three Oranges\"). He is a kind man, who goes with the flow of life. Wilson's dream-like manner is often mimicked by the platoon, mostly Privates Walker and Fraser, but the men like him, and some admire him (including Jones, Godfrey, and most of all Private Pike). Rather than bark orders as a sergeant would be expected to do, he asks \"Would you mind awfully falling in, please?\"\n\nHowever, when pushed, a different Wilson emerges. In \"High Finance\", it is revealed that Warden Hodges has been forcing his attentions on Mrs Pike by blackmailing her with a rent increase; Wilson reacts by punching Hodges in the face, to the admiration of Mrs Pike and Frank. Wilson is the only member of the platoon to be physically violent, as in \"Absent Friends\" when Pike, Jones, Fraser, Walker and Mainwaring attempt to subdue three IRA members and are beaten, Wilson defeats them singlehanded with only bruised knuckles to show for it.\n\nIn social settings, Wilson is effortlessly charming, often to the frustration of Mainwaring (who is the exact opposite of Wilson in these situations), especially as many of the people Mainwaring is hoping to impress are people Wilson already knows quite well. Wilson even manages to charm Mrs. Mainwaring (albeit over the telephone, as she is never seen on screen), telling her \"we understand him, don't we\" in reference to her husband.\n\nWhen it comes to women, Wilson is especially debonair, effortlessly flirting and attracting the attention of women, often to the exasperation of Mainwaring, who detests Wilson's flirtatious manner (such as when he is flirting with Mainwaring's nurse, some of the ladies signing up to join the Home Guard, or even the young woman serving drinks at a social event). In the episode \"Man Hunt\", Wilson asks an attractive young woman to let him come in and look at her knickers, when it is suspected they may have been made of material from a German pilot's parachute (as a result of one of Walker's many black market schemes); in response to this request, the young woman eagerly agrees and invites Wilson inside. This prompts Walker (who was forced to remain outside with Mainwaring after the young woman invited Wilson inside) to remark to Mainwaring about the \"extraordinary influence\" Wilson has over women. Mainwaring replies that he is getting a little bored with his sergeant’s pecadillos.\n\nWilson's charm is not limitless, however; in the episode \"The Two and a Half Feathers\", Wilson clashes several times with one of the serving ladies during lunch at the British Restaurant; the serving lady is clearly unimpressed with Wilson's upper-class manner of speech (calling it \"lah-de-dah talk\"), and even referring to Wilson as a \"capitalist lackey\" when he leaves his dirty dishes behind for her to gather up.\n\nRelationship with Mainwaring \nTension and comedy between Wilson and Mainwaring is heightened by their difference in social class: Wilson had an upper middle class childhood and a public school education, prompting resentment from the lower middle class Mainwaring, who had to work his way up and views Wilson as having had it easy. Mainwaring frequently emphasises his superior rank at the bank and in the Home Guard to maintain his authority and superiority over Wilson. Wilson undermines his superior through casual charm and frequent concern at Mainwaring's plans, querying, \"Do you really think that's wise, sir?\"\n\nThe contrasts are established in several ways: as a civilian, Mainwaring wears a bowler hat while Wilson wears a more fashionable Anthony Eden hat. In \"The Honourable Man\", Wilson became \"The Honourable Arthur Wilson\" after an uncle who was a peer dies. Mainwaring tried to stay at the centre of attention; Wilson detested his new style and the unwelcome attention it brought him and refused to use his title, which only infuriated Mainwaring more, as he believed one should revel in titles of nobility rather than be ashamed of them.\n\nConflict between the two reaches a head in \"A. Wilson (Manager)?\", in which Wilson is promoted as manager of another branch and also to second lieutenant in a neighbouring Home Guard Unit. Wilson finds out that he would have been promoted long ago if Mainwaring had not told his superiors that he was unsuitable for promotion. Mainwaring's resentment of Wilson's breeding is revealed. Wilson's new branch is bombed, so he has to return to Walmington. His sign, \"A. WILSON, manager\", is among the debris. Mainwaring's first concern is to let Wilson know that GHQ is allowing him to keep his rank. Wilson is glad until Mainwaring throws him the sergeant's stripes.\n\nWilson thinks Mainwaring a pompous fool; in \"A. Wilson (Manager)?\", Wilson reminds Mainwaring that when he first wore his captain's uniform, he saw him walking up and down the high street all afternoon trying to find someone to salute him, but he had to make do with a sea scout troop. However, they remain friends. In the episode \"Room at the Bottom\", Wilson was told that Mainwaring had not been commissioned a captain's position, and was gleeful when he was told thus Mainwaring would be demoted. Wilson provides a more realistic and down-to-earth appraisal of a situation than Mainwaring, who is blinded by pomposity and patriotism, as demonstrated in this exchange:\n\nMainwaring: They'll never get through the Maginot Line.\nWilson: Haven't you heard... They went around the side.\nMainwaring: That's a typical shabby Nazi trick!\n\nMainwaring also routinely comments on Wilson's private life, specifically his relationship with Mrs Pike and her son (and their underling at the bank and fellow platoon member) Frank. Mainwaring often chastises Wilson to handle either Mrs Pike or Frank whenever they cause problems for him (usually revolving around Mrs. Pike's complaints to Mainwaring of how he treats her son, who she views as overly delicate). Wilson's response to this is usually a mix of nonchalance and exasperation, though in the episode \"War Dance\", he finally displays his irritation at Mainwaring's butting into his personal life; when Mainwaring refers to him as \"Peter Pan\" due to his reluctance to act as a father figure to Pike, Wilson drops his normal air of deference to his boss and platoon leader, and angrily replies \"My god, Mainwaring, you can hit pretty low when it suits you!\"\n\nDespite their conflicts, however, Wilson and Mainwaring do share a respectful, if somewhat formal, sort of friendship. In the episode \"Something Nasty in the Vault\", Wilson and Mainwaring are trapped in the vault of their bank, desperately cradling an unexploded German bomb. During this time, they bond over their shared danger; at one point Mainwaring even scratches Wilson's nose for him when he develops a maddening itch.\n\nLikewise, in the episode \"Keep Young and Beautiful\", when presented with the possibility that some of the members of their platoon may be reassigned to the ARP due to their age, Wilson points out to Mainwaring that he has no wish to leave the platoon and is actually very proud of what the two of them have achieved. On several occasions, Mainwaring informs Wilson that he considers him not just his subordinate (at both the bank and the platoon), but also a friend.\n\nIn the final episode, Wilson turns up at the wedding of Jones and Mrs Fox in a captain's uniform, having achieved the rank during the First World War. He is modest about it (in the first episode Wilson claims to have been a sergeant in the Royal Artillery serving at Mons, Passchendaele and Gallipoli) and Mainwaring is pleasantly surprised – although he insisted that \"it doesn't change anything, you know.\"\n\nMedals \nAlthough Sergeant Wilson rarely wore his ribbons, he was awarded the usual trilogy of First World War campaign medals (commonly known as \"Pip, Squeak and Wilfred\"), that he had previously been awarded as a captain in the First World War.\n\nOther portrayals \nIn the feature film Dad's Army released in 2016, Wilson is played by Bill Nighy.\n\nWilson is played by Robert Bathurst in a series of re-enactments of otherwise lost episodes of Dad's Army.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\nDad's Army characters\nFictional military sergeants\nFictional World War I veterans\nFictional bankers\nTelevision characters introduced in 1968"}

Another character, lawyer Jerry Nichols, appeared in Uneasy Money (1916).\n\nBachelors Anonymous was the second last novel completed by Wodehouse, with the last being Aunts Aren't Gentlemen.\n\nPlot\nEphraim Trout of Trout, Wapshott and Edelstein, a legal firm employed by Ivor Llewellyn, head of the Superba-Llewellyn studio of Hollywood, has handled Llewellyn's five divorces. Llewellyn is on his way to London on business, and Trout sees Llewellyn off at the Los Angeles airport. Trout warns him against any more impulsive proposals. Trout has managed to stay single since he belongs to a California group called Bachelors Anonymous, inspired by Alcoholics Anonymous. When one member feels the impulse to take a woman out to dinner, he seeks out the other members and they reason with him. He advises Llewellyn to consult the legal firm of Nichols, Erridge and Trubshaw in London, as they can find someone to act as a similar advisor for Llewellyn. Other members of Bachelors Anonymous convince Trout to follow Llewellyn to London to help. In London, Llewellyn meets Vera Dalrymple, the star of the Regal Theatre's stage comedy Cousin Angela, written by Joseph \"Joe\" Pickering (who makes his living working for the solicitors Shoesmith, Shoesmith, Shoesmith, and Shoesmith, mentioned in other stories such as Ice in the Bedroom). Joe is interviewed by Sally Fitch (from Much Middlefold) for a women's paper, and they get along well.\n\nVera monopolizes the show and Cousin Angela closes after only 16 performances. The Regal Theatre's stage-doorkeeper Mac (who appeared in A Damsel in Distress and Summer Lightning) gives his sympathy to Joe. While waiting to see Vera, a drunk man threatens Mac, so Joe throws him out. Joe learns from his friend Jerry Nichols, of the Nichols, Erridge and Trubshaw law firm, that he can earn a lucrative salary working for Llewellyn. Joe falls in love with Sally and makes plans to have lunch with her at Barribault's. Jerry tells Sally that she has inherited a legacy from a former employer, Letitia Carberry, supporter of the Anti-Tobacco League. Carberry left most of her money to the League but left Sally twenty-five thousand pounds on the condition that she not smoke for two years. Sally is to live in a posh Park Lane apartment with a private detective, Daphne Dolby, the owner of the Eagle Eye detective agency, who will know if Sally smokes. Daphne is engaged to Sir Jaklyn Warner, Baronet, because she is interested in his title and he in her money. Jaklyn, who is Sally's ex-fiancé, hears about Sally's inheritance. Sally accidentally falls asleep and misses lunch with Joe.\n\nLlewellyn explains the Bachelors Anonymous idea to Joe, and recognizes him as the man who threw him out at the theatre and kept him from having dinner with Vera. Impressed, Llewellyn hires him. Sally apologizes to Joe for missing lunch and agrees to dinner. Trout sees Llewellyn, who is concerned that Joe has fallen for Sally. This worries Trout, and to keep Joe from going to dinner, he slips Joe a Mickey Finn. Sally is disappointed when Joe fails to appear, believing it to be petty revenge for her missing lunch. Jaklyn proposes to her (for her money) and she accepts, not knowing he is engaged to Daphne. She mentions her engagement to Daphne, and Daphne realizes what occurred. With one of her operatives, the intimidating Cyril Pemberton, she makes Jaklyn join her at the registry office to get married.\n\nSally refuses to listen to Joe and goes to Valley Fields to see her former nanny Jane Priestley, who turns Joe and Trout away. Trout's hand is bitten by a dog named Percy, and the dog's owner, Amelia Bingham, bandages his hand. She is a hospital nurse. Trout falls for her, and now approves of marriage. Llewellyn is astonished when Trout accepts dinner with Vera on Llewellyn's behalf. Joe suggests that Llewellyn get a check-up at a hospital to hide from Vera. Trout, who has resigned from Bachelors Anonymous, admits to slipping Joe a Mickey Finn and apologizes to him. Trout tells Sally everything, and she reconciles with Joe. Unaware that Jaklyn is now married, Trout pays him off with fifty pounds to prevent a breach of promise case. Daphne catches Sally smoking, and Joe is fired by Llewellyn, who impulsively proposed to his nurse at the hospital, Amelia. However, all ends well when Llewellyn learns Trout has got engaged to Amelia. Llewellyn decides to make Joe's play into a movie and pays him two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and will become a member of Bachelors Anonymous when he returns to California with a letter of introduction from Trout.\n\nPublication history\nThe illustration on the first UK edition dust jacket of Amelia Bingham bandaging Ephraim Trout's hand was drawn by Osbert Lancaster. The back of the dust jacket features a photograph of Wodehouse looking out a window, taken by Tom Blau, Camera Press. The same illustration and photograph were used for the first US edition for the front and back of the dust jacket respectively.\n\nThe US edition of the book is dedicated: \"To Peter Schwed, as always\". Peter Schwed was Wodehouse's editor at Simon & Schuster. Wodehouse had also dedicated the US editions of Bertie Wooster Sees It Through, Author! Author!, and The Purloined Paperweight to Schwed.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nThe Russian Wodehouse Society's page, with a list of characters\n\nNovels by P. G.

{"id": "4103941", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence%20%281977%20film%29", "title": "Providence (1977 film)", "text": "Providence is a 1977 French/Swiss film directed by Alain Resnais from a screenplay by David Mercer.   It explores the processes of creativity through a portrayal of an ageing novelist, played by John Gielgud, who imagines scenes for his latest novel which draw upon his past and his relationships with members of his family. The film won the 1978 César Award for Best Film.\n\nPlot\nOn the eve of his 78th birthday, the ailing, alcoholic writer Clive Langham spends a painful and sleepless night mentally composing and recomposing scenes for a novel in which characters based on his own family are shaped by his fantasies and memories, alongside his caustic commentary on their behaviour. His son Claude appears as a cold and unforgiving prosecuting lawyer, who revels in spiteful repartee. His second (illegitimate) son Kevin features as an idealistic soldier accused of the mercy-killing of an old man who was being hunted down. Claude's wife Sonia shows sympathy with Kevin and seems eager to seduce him in protest at her husband's callousness. Clive also invents the character of Helen, as Claude's mistress, but she bears the features of Clive's dead wife Molly who committed suicide. Clive's imagination is also haunted by scenes of an autopsy on the corpse of an old man, a military round-up of elderly people who are detained in a sports stadium, and a dark tangled forest in which a hunted man metamorphoses into a werewolf. Before Clive loses consciousness, it is Kevin whom he sees as the werewolf in the forest; Claude shoots Kevin but seems to identify him with their father.\n\nOn the following day, Clive welcomes Claude, Sonia and Kevin (in reality an astrophysicist) for an idyllic birthday lunch in the sunlit garden of his country mansion, and their relationships are characterised by mutual affection and good humour, albeit with signs of self-restraint in deference to the occasion. After lunch, in what he seems to envisage as a final parting, Clive unexpectedly asks them all to leave without a word.\n\nCast\n John Gielgud as Clive Langham. Gielgud described his role as \"a very tough, Augustus John kind of character, drunk half the time, lying in bed drinking white wine and throwing bottles about, and roaring a lot of very coarse dialogue.\"\n Dirk Bogarde as Claude Langham\n Ellen Burstyn as Sonia Langham\n David Warner as Kevin Langham / Kevin Woodford\n Elaine Stritch as Helen Wiener\n Cyril Luckham as Doctor Mark Eddington\n Denis Lawson as Dave Woodford\n Kathryn Leigh Scott as Miss Boon\n Milo Sperber as Mr. Jenner\n Anna Wing as Karen\n Peter Arne as Nils\n Tanya Lopert as Miss Lister\n\nProduction\nThe producer Klaus Hellwig suggested to Resnais that he should make a film with the British playwright David Mercer.  The two men met in London and, overcoming the obstacle that neither of them spoke the language of the other fluently, they began a series of discussions of drafts and redraftings which extended over a year. Mercer's original idea concerned the situation of political prisoners held in a sports stadium, symbolising a world in collapse.  Gradually the outline shifted to the imagination of an aging writer seeking the material for a novel. Resnais proposed making the whole film into a metaphor of creation and disintegration; he also made extensive alterations to the chronology of the scenes as written by Mercer.\n\nThe title of the film was also supplied by the producer, signifying both the name of the estate where the ageing novelist lives and also the controlling hand with which he arranges the fate of his characters.  The name evoked further associations with the American city of Providence, the home of the fantasy writer H. P. Lovecraft whose gothic stories inspired some of the imagery in the film.\n\nThe original intention was to shoot the film in the United States in New England but for reasons of cost this became impracticable. Certain exterior scenes were filmed in Providence and in Albany in the US, while others were done in Brussels, Antwerp, and Louvain; these were used in conjunction with each other to form a composite cityscape for the background of certain scenes. Studio scenes were filmed in Paris. The final birthday party sequence was shot on location at the château de Montméry at Ambazac near Limoges.  Filming took place between April and June 1976.\n\nThe set designs were created by Jacques Saulnier, a regular collaborator with Resnais, and he won a César award for his work.  In order to create a funereal atmosphere, grey and dark shades predominated in the design and strong colours were excluded. Saulnier recalled that Resnais made him read Lovecraft in order to imbue Langham's house with the presence of death: \"I imagined it like a family tomb\".  In some scenes (created in Clive Langham's imagination) the layout of a set changes between one shot and another (for instance, the door in the corner of a room in one shot appears at the bottom of a flight of stairs in another; a conversation between four characters alone in one scene continues in the midst of a party in the next). Some settings use a painted backdrop which has a deliberately theatrical appearance; one of them portrays a seascape in which artificial waves surge up among the painted rocks (achieved by blowing bursts of polystyrene foam pieces from beneath the set).\n\nProvidence was Resnais's first film in English, and a prestigious cast of British and American actors was engaged despite the restrictions on the budget. Resnais held a longstanding ambition to cast John Gielgud in a substantial film role, having seen him performing on stage, and was encouraged to approach him by Dirk Bogarde.  Gielgud later described the project as \"by far the most exciting film I have ever made\", and noted the impressive calmness of Resnais throughout filming which made him \"wonderful to work with\".  He also recalled the contribution made by Florence Malraux, Resnais's wife, who spoke fluent English and helped overcome the director's limitations in that respect.  Resnais attached great importance to the interplay of vocal timbres of his principal actors, and he described how he thought of them as a Schubertian quintet:  Ellen Burstyn a violin, Dirk Bogarde a piano, David Warner a viola, John Gielgud a cello, and Elaine Stritch a double bass.\n\nThe original intention had been to make the film in French, translating it from the English.  Resnais however soon felt that it would not work in French: \"I could hear it so clearly in English and anyway, Mercer's writing depended on the English inflection.\"   The producers agreed, but insisted that there should also be a French version.\" The process of dubbing the completed work into French was undertaken with particular care: the voice actors included Claude Dauphin as Clive, François Périer as Claude, Gérard Depardieu as Kevin, Nelly Borgeaud as Sonia, and Suzanne Flon as Helen.\n\nFor the music Resnais turned to the Hungarian-born Hollywood composer Miklós Rózsa, whom he had admired especially for his work on the 1949 version of Madame Bovary. Rózsa later cited Resnais as one of the few directors in his experience who really understood the function of music in film. Soundtrack albums were eventually issued on LP and CD.\n\nThemes\nResnais described the film as a \"macabre divertissement\", insisting that he wanted it to be funny despite the darkness of its themes.  He also said that one of the questions which the film poses is whether we are the people we think we are or whether we become what others make of us in their judgments.\n\nA central theme is the process of artistic creation: \"[Providence] is a meta-film, a film about the making of films, a work of art about the fabricating of art works.\" Expanding this idea: \"The film suggests some symbiotic relation between creator and created script.... The characters are [Clive's] creations, yet he speaks to them as if they were wilful children. Their status is ambiguous since they a composite: they are dream figures, created characters and also individuals who are part of Clive's proximate reality.\"\n\nIn counterpoint with creativity, the theme of death recurs constantly, not so much as a subject in itself but in Clive's struggle to avoid it: Resnais described the film as telling the story of the old writer's determination not to die, and his continual drinking and imagining are the evidence of his refusal to let go. As well as the funereal aspects of the decor and the scenes of autopsy, the repeated instances of metamorphosis of a character into a werewolf is linked to the advent of death, with the implication that the process of dying reduces man to animal.  Clive also has an obsession that the young are trying to push him aside, to kill him, which he visualises in the scenes of the stadium/concentration camp where the old are rounded up by soldiers who are all young.\n\nOther motifs which contribute to the mood of morbid anxiety are the military search parties and images of deportation, the helicopter surveillance, the sound of bombs and ambulance sirens, and the demolition of buildings.\n\nAs several writers about the film have observed, the opening sequence mirrors the beginning of Citizen Kane: the plaque outside the house, the camera closing in on a lighted doorway, the breaking of a glass object, the close-up of the lips of Clive as he curses. Whereas the personality of Kane is explored through the separate 'versions' of people who knew him, in Providence it is the central figure of Clive who draws the characters of the members of his family and gives a reflection of himself through them.\n\nOne of the thoughts on his own style of expression that was written for the character of Clive by David Mercer has been noted by many critics as especially applicable to Resnais himself.  Citing a criticism of his own creative work that the pursuit of style has often resulted in a lack of feeling, Clive then argues back that \"Style is feeling—in its most elegant and economic expression.\"\n\nReception and influence\nIn France the press response to Providence at the time of its release (and again at its re-release in 1983) was overwhelmingly enthusiastic. Many argued that it was a film of great cultural importance, and a highlight in Resnais's career. The film went on to win seven prizes at the César awards, including Best Film and Best Director.\n\nBy contrast, reviewers in the United States were predominantly hostile to the film. Vincent Canby in The New York Times called it a \"disastrously ill-chosen comedy\" and \"a lot of fuss and fake feathers about nothing\"; he found the script pretentious and the structure complicated without being complex. For John Simon in New York it was an \"unmitigated disaster\" in which he criticised almost every aspect with the exception of John Gielgud's performance. Pauline Kael wrote a 2000 word review in The New Yorker which found fault with the contradictory structure, the stilted language, the artificiality of the acting, and the glacial directorial style of the film before concluding that all it amounted to was \"the pain of a 'clever' English play\". A short notice in Variety took a different view, referring to \"an unusual visual tour-de-force ... offering dense insights into the flights of imagination of a supposedly dying writer\".\n\nIn the UK, the film received a more varied reception, and it had a successful box-office run in London.  David Robinson writing in The Times was troubled by the quality of the writing:  \"Resnais's visual creations ... seem very flimsily supported on the frame of David Mercer's script ...  the writing, again, is self-conscious, stiffly literary.  The dialogue is formal, and artificial ... And the pretensions of the text only increase suspicion that it is not about very much at all.\" A non-judgmental review in the Monthly Film Bulletin emphasised the many layers of thematic cross-reference both within the film and beyond it, with echoes of other work written by David Mercer and elements from other films as well as the occasional interleaving of European and American landscapes. Gilbert Adair in Sight & Sound contrasted David Mercer's excessively literal script in which \"nothing is left unstated\" with the extent of the personal mythology and fantasy which Resnais was able to introduce into the film; he found the work enriched by its anti-naturalistic devices such as the gaffes in continuity which emerge in Clive's plotting of his novel and the exchange of voices of the characters, as well as by the disjunctive appearances of a clownish footballer in inappropriate scenes; and despite certain reservations he concluded that \"the dream cast perform together superbly\". A specific criticism of one aspect of the film appeared in a comment column of the British Medical Journal, where it was argued that the inclusion of scenes of a post-mortem on a corpse (accurate but unsparing) was \"undignified and uncivilised and ought to be condemned\" because the audience was not prepared for them and they were unnecessary to the plot.\n\nRetrospective evaluations of Providence have generally been more positive than the contemporary ones. In the Oxford History of World Cinema it is described as \"a magisterial and deeply moving incursion into the fantasies of a dying man\". For the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, \"The superb performances and Miklós Rózsa's sumptuous Hollywood-style score give the film's conceit a moving monumentality and depth, and Resnais' insights into the fiction-making process are mesmerising and beautiful.\" The artist Tacita Dean cited Providence as her favourite film, saying that \"it deals effortlessly with the problems of enacting the fantasies of a writer’s imagination. It mixes places and time within single sequences to create an uncanny sense of dislocation but its brilliance is its leanness – not a single moment of excess.\"\n\nOne of the aspects of the film which has generated most comment and disagreement is the interpretation of the two-part structure and to what extent one of them represents 'deception' and the other 'truth'.  For Pauline Kael, the 'imagined' part and the 'real' part contradict each other because either they cannot both be true or else they are not both relevant. Others have found different grounds for criticism, arguing that the final 'real' section represents a compromise and a concession to conventional cinema, a denial of all the bold experimentation of the previous four-fifths of the film. Alain Robbe-Grillet, writer of the screenplay for Resnais's earlier exploration of imagination and recollection, L'Année dernière à Marienbad, was one of those who disapproved of the final section.  An alternative view is that the final lyrical section of the birthday party does not present a definitive picture of the family as they really are, but rather another perspective on them in the puzzle which Clive – both as writer and as father – is trying to solve. As one critic has expressed it: The second part of the film supplements the first by altering its effect, by denying its sometimes hostile paranoid proof but not by eradicating these altogether. The parts of the film open Providence up as a series of reflecting realities which, wound together, may offer something of the hesitance and doubt of mental process. In this sense, Providence may be seen as a precursor to the work of David Lynch in films such as Lost Highway (1997) and Mulholland Drive (2001).Providence received five top-10 votes (three from critics and two from directors) in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made.\n\nAwards and nominations\nBodil Awards (Denmark)\nWon: Best European Film\nCésar Awards (France)\nWon: Best Director (Alain Resnais)\nWon: Best Editing (Albert Jurgenson)\nWon: Best Film\nWon: Best Music (Miklós Rózsa)\nWon: Best Production Design (Jacques Saulnier)\nWon: Best Sound (René Magnol and Jacques Maumont)\nWon: Best Writing (David Mercer)\nNominated: Best Cinematography (Ricardo Aronovich)\nFrench Syndicate of Cinema Critics (France)\nWon: Best Film\nNew York Film Critics (USA)\nWon: Best Actor (John Gielgud)\nValladolid Film Festival (Spain)\nWon: Golden Spike (Alain Resnais)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nFilms directed by Alain Resnais\n1977 films\nSwiss drama films\n1970s English-language films\nBest Film César Award winners\nFilms whose director won the Best Director César Award\nFilms scored by Miklós Rózsa\nFrench drama films\nEnglish-language French films\nEnglish-language Swiss films\n1970s French films"}
{"id": "4103963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence%20spacing", "title": "Sentence spacing", "text": "Sentence spacing concerns how spaces are inserted between sentences in typeset text and is a matter of typographical convention. Since the introduction of movable-type printing in Europe, various sentence spacing conventions have been used in languages with a Latin alphabet. These include a normal word space (as between the words in a sentence), a single enlarged space, and two full spaces.\n\nUntil the 20th century, publishing houses and printers in many countries used additional space between sentences. There were exceptions to this traditional spacing method—some printers used spacing between sentences that was no wider than word spacing. This was French spacing—a term synonymous with single-space sentence spacing until the late 20th century. With the introduction of the typewriter in the late 19th century, typists used two spaces between sentences to mimic the style used by traditional typesetters. While wide sentence spacing was phased out in the printing industry in the mid-20th century, the practice continued on typewriters and later on computers. Perhaps because of this, many modern sources now incorrectly claim that wide spacing was created for the typewriter.\n\nThe desired or correct sentence spacing is often debated, but most sources now state that an additional space is not necessary or desirable. From around 1950, single sentence spacing became standard in books, magazines, and newspapers, and the majority of style guides that use a Latin-derived alphabet as a language base now prescribe or recommend the use of a single space after the concluding punctuation of a sentence. However, some sources still state that additional spacing is correct or acceptable. Some people preferred double sentence spacing because that was how they were taught to type. The few direct studies conducted since 2002 have produced inconclusive results as to which convention is more readable.\n\nHistory\n\nTraditional typesetting\n\nShortly after the invention of movable type, highly variable spacing was created, which could create spaces of any size and allowed for perfectly even justification. Early American, English, and other European typesetters' style guides (also known as printers' rules) specified spacing standards that were all essentially identical from the 18th century onwards. These guides—e.g., Jacobi in the UK (1890) and MacKellar, Harpel, and De Vinne (1866–1901) in the U.S.—indicated that sentences should be em-spaced, and that words should be 1/3 or 1/2 em-spaced. The relative size of the sentence spacing would vary depending on the size of the word spaces and the justification needs. For most countries, this remained the standard for published work until the 20th century. Yet, even in this period, there were publishing houses that used a standard word space between sentences.\n\nMechanical type and the advent of the typewriter\nMechanical type systems introduced near the end of the 19th century, such as the Linotype and Monotype machines, allowed for some variable sentence spacing similar to hand composition. Just as these machines revolutionized the mass production of text, the advent of the typewriter around the same time revolutionized the creation of personal and business documents. But the typewriters' mechanical limitations did not allow variable spacing—typists could only choose the number of times they pressed the space bar. Typists in some English-speaking countries initially learned to insert three spaces between sentences to approximate the wider sentence spacing used in traditional printing, but later settled on two spaces, a practice that continued throughout the 20th century. This became known as English spacing and marked a divergence from French typists, who continued to use French spacing.\n\nTransition to single spacing\nIn the early 20th century, some printers began using one and a half interword spaces (an \"en quad\") to separate sentences. This standard continued in use, to some extent, into the 1990s.\n\nMagazines, newspapers, and books began to adopt the single-space convention in the United States in the 1940s and in the United Kingdom in the 1950s. Typists did not move to single spacing simultaneously.\n\nTechnological advances began affecting sentence spacing methods. In 1941, IBM introduced the Executive, a typewriter capable of proportional spacing, which had been used in professional typesetting for hundreds of years. This innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had on the typewriter, reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations. However, this innovation did not spread throughout the typewriter industry; the majority of mechanical typewriters, including all of the widely distributed models, remained monospaced, while a small minority of special models carried the innovations. By the 1960s, electronic phototypesetting systems ignored runs of white space in text. This was also true for the World Wide Web, as HTML normally ignores additional spacing, although in 2011 the CSS 2.1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces. In the 1980s, desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools.\n\nModern literature\n\nTypography\nEarly positions on typography (the \"arrangement and appearance of text\") supported traditional spacing techniques in English publications. In 1954, Geoffrey Dowding's book Finer Points in the Spacing and Arrangement of Type underscored the widespread shift from a single enlarged em space to a standard word space between sentences.\n\nWith the advent of the computer age, typographers began deprecating double spacing, even in monospaced text. In 1989, Desktop Publishing by Design stated that \"typesetting requires only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation points, and colons\" and identified single sentence spacing as a typographic convention. Stop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works (1993) and Designing with Type: The Essential Guide to Typography (2006) both indicate that uniform spacing should be used between words, including between sentences.\n\nMore recent works on typography weigh in strongly. Ilene Strizver, founder of the Type Studio, says: \"Forget about tolerating differences of opinion: typographically speaking, typing two spaces before the start of a new sentence is absolutely, unequivocally wrong.\" The Complete Manual on Typography (2003) states that \"The typewriter tradition of separating sentences with two-word spaces after a period has no place in typesetting\" and that the single space is \"standard typographic practice\". The Elements of Typographic Style (2004) advocates a single space between sentences, noting that \"your typing as well as your typesetting will benefit from unlearning this quaint [double spacing] Victorian habit\".\n\nDavid Jury's book About Face: Reviving the Rules of Typography (2004)—published in Switzerland—clarifies the contemporary typographic position on sentence spacing:\nWord spaces, preceding or following punctuation, should be optically adjusted to appear to be of the same value as a standard word space. If a standard word space is inserted after a full point or a comma, then, optically, this produces a space of up to 50% wider than that of other word spaces within a line of type. This is because these punctuation marks carry space above them, which, when added to the adjacent standard word spaces, combines to create a visually larger space. Some argue that the \"additional\" space after a comma and full point serves as a \"pause signal\" for the reader. But this is unnecessary (and visually disruptive) since the pause signal is provided by the punctuation mark itself.\n\nStyle and language guides\n\nStyle guides\nEarly style guides for typesetting used a wider space between sentences than between words—\"traditional spacing\", as shown in the illustration to the right. During the 20th century, style guides commonly mandated two spaces between sentences for typewritten manuscripts, which were used prior to professionally typesetting the work. As computer desktop publishing became commonplace, typewritten manuscripts became less relevant and most style guides stopped making distinctions between manuscripts and final typeset products. In the same period, style guides began changing their guidance on sentence spacing. The 1969 edition of the Chicago Manual of Style used em spaces between sentences in its text; by the 2003 edition it had changed to single sentence spacing for both manuscript and print. By the 1980s, the United Kingdom's Hart's Rules (1983) had shifted to single sentence spacing. Other style guides followed suit in the 1990s. Soon after the beginning of the 21st century, the majority of style guides had changed to indicate that only one word space was proper between sentences.\n\nModern style guides provide standards and guidance for the written language. These works are important to writers, since \"virtually all professional editors work closely with one of them in editing a manuscript for publication\". Late editions of comprehensive style guides, such as the Oxford Style Manual (2003) in the United Kingdom and the Chicago Manual of Style (2010) in the United States, provide standards for a wide variety of writing and design topics, including sentence spacing. The majority of style guides now prescribe the use of a single space after terminal punctuation in final written works and publications. A few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work, and the Gregg Reference Manual makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences. Web design guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic, as \"HTML refuses to recognize double spaces altogether\". These works themselves follow the current publication standard of single sentence spacing.\n\nThe European Union's Interinstitutional Style Guide (2008) indicates that single sentence spacing is to be used in all European Union publications—encompassing 23 languages. For the English language, the European Commission's English Style Guide (2010) states that sentences are always single-spaced. The Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers (2007), first published in 1966 by the Commonwealth Government Printing Office of Australia, stipulates that only one space is used after \"sentence-closing punctuation\" and that \"Programs for word processing and desktop publishing offer more sophisticated, variable spacing, so this practice of double spacing is now avoided because it can create distracting gaps on a page.\"\n\nNational languages not covered by an authoritative language academy typically have multiple style guides, only some of which may discuss sentence spacing. This is the case in the United Kingdom. The Oxford Style Manual (2003) and the Modern Humanities Research Association's MHRA Style Guide (2002) state that only single spacing should be used. In Canada, both the English- and French-language sections of the Canadian Style, A Guide to Writing and Editing (1997), prescribe single sentence spacing. In the United States, many style guides—such as the Chicago Manual of Style (2003)—allow only single sentence spacing. The most important style guide in Italy,  (2009), does not address sentence spacing, but the  (2010), the official guide for Microsoft translation, tells users to use single sentence spacing \"instead of the double spacing used in the United States\".\n\nLanguage guides\nSome languages, such as French and Spanish, have academies that set language rules. Their publications typically address orthography and grammar as opposed to matters of typography. Style guides are less relevant for such languages, as their academies set prescriptive rules. For example, the  publishes the  for French speakers worldwide. The 1992 edition does not provide guidance on sentence spacing, but is single-sentence-spaced throughout—consistent with historical French spacing. The Spanish language is similar. The most important body within the Association of Spanish Language Academies, the Royal Spanish Academy, publishes the , which is viewed as prescriptive for the Spanish language worldwide. The 2001 edition does not provide sentence-spacing guidance, but is itself single-sentence-spaced. The German language manual  (\"Recommendations of the Council for German Orthography\"; 2006) does not address sentence spacing. The manual itself uses one space after terminal punctuation. Additionally, the Duden, the German-language dictionary most commonly used in Germany, indicates that double sentence spacing is an error.\n\nGrammar guides\nA few reference grammars address sentence spacing, as increased spacing between words is punctuation in itself. Most do not. Grammar guides typically cover terminal punctuation and the proper construction of sentences—but not the spacing between sentences. Moreover, many modern grammar guides are designed for quick reference and refer users to comprehensive style guides for additional matters of writing style. For example, the Pocket Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Punctuation (2005) points users to style guides such as the MLA Style Manual for consistency in formatting work and for all other \"editorial concerns\". The Grammar Bible (2004) states that \"The modern system of English punctuation is by no means simple. A book that covers all the bases would need to be of considerable breadth and weight and anyone interested in such a resource is advised to consult the Chicago Manual of Style.\"\n\nComputer era\n\nIn the computer era, spacing between sentences is handled in several different ways by various software packages. Some systems accept whatever the user types, while others attempt to alter the spacing or use the user input as a method of detecting sentences. Computer-based word processors and typesetting software such as troff and TeX allow users to arrange text in a manner previously only available to professional typesetters.\n\nThe text-editing environment in Emacs uses a double space following a period to identify the end of sentences unambiguously; the double-space convention prevents confusion with periods within sentences that signify abbreviations. How Emacs recognizes the end of a sentence is controlled by the settings sentence-end-double-space and sentence-end.\n\nThe Unix typesetter program Troff uses two spaces to mark the end of a sentence. This allows the typesetter to distinguish sentence endings from abbreviations and to typeset them differently. Early versions of Troff, which only typeset in fixed-width fonts, would automatically add a second space between sentences, which were detected based on the combination of terminal punctuation and a line feed.\n\nIn the April 2020 update, Microsoft Word started highlighting two spaces after a period as an error and offers a correction of one space.\n\nMultiple spaces are eliminated by default in most World Wide Web content, whether or not they are associated with sentences. There are options for preserving spacing, such as the CSS white-space property, and the <pre> tag.\n\nControversy\nJames Felici, author of the Complete Manual of Typography, says that the topic of sentence spacing is \"the debate that refuses to die ... In all my years of writing about type, it's still the question I hear most often, and a search of the web will find threads galore on the subject.\"\n\nMany people are opposed to single sentence spacing for various reasons. Some state that the habit of double spacing is too deeply ingrained to change. Others claim that additional space between sentences improves the aesthetics or readability of text. Proponents of double sentence spacing also state that some publishers may still require double-spaced manuscript submissions from authors. A key example noted is the screenwriting industry's monospaced standard for screenplay manuscripts, Courier, 12-point font, although some works on screenwriting indicate that Courier is merely preferred—proportional fonts may be used. Some reliable sources state simply that writers should follow their particular style guide, but proponents of double spacing caution that publishers' guidance takes precedence, including those that ask for double-sentence-spaced manuscripts.\n\nOne of the most popular arguments against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for monospaced fonts of the typewriter and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts.\nHowever, proportional fonts existed together with wide sentence spacing for centuries before the typewriter and remained for decades after its invention. When the typewriter was first introduced, typists were most commonly taught to use three spaces between sentences. This gradually shifted to two spaces, while the print industry remained unchanged in its wide em-spaced sentences. Some sources now state it is acceptable for monospaced fonts to be single-spaced today, although other references continue to specify double spacing for monospaced fonts. The double-space typewriter convention has been taught in schools in typing classes and remains the practice in many cases. Some voice concern that students will later be forced to relearn how to type.\n\nMost style guides indicate that single sentence spacing is proper for final or published work today, and most publishers require manuscripts to be submitted as they will appear in publication—with single sentence spacing. Writing sources typically recommend that prospective authors remove extra spaces before submitting manuscripts, although other sources state that publishers will use software to remove the spaces before final publication.\n\nEffects on readability and legibility\nClaims abound regarding the legibility and readability of the single and double sentence spacing methods—by proponents on both sides. Supporters of single spacing assert that familiarity with the current standard in books, magazines, and the Web enhances readability, that double spacing looks strange in text using proportional fonts, and that the \"rivers\" and \"holes\" caused by double spacing impair readability. Proponents of double sentence spacing state that the extra space between sentences enhances readability by providing clearer breaks between sentences and making text appear more legible.\n\nHowever, typographic opinions are typically anecdotal with no basis in evidence. \"Opinions are not always safe guides to legibility of print\", and when direct studies are conducted, anecdotal opinions—even those of experts—can turn out to be false. Text that seems legible (visually pleasing at first glance) may be shown to actually impair reading effectiveness when subjected to scientific study.\n\nStudies\nDirect studies on sentence spacing include those by Loh, Branch, Shewanown, and Ali (2002); and Clinton, Branch, Holschuh, and Shewanown (2003); with results favoring neither single, double, nor triple spacing. The 2002 study tested participants' reading speed for passages of on-screen text with single and double sentence spacing. The authors stated that \"the 'double space group' consistently took longer time to finish than the 'single space' group\" but concluded that \"there was not enough evidence to suggest that a significant difference exists\". The 2003 study analyzed on-screen single, double, and triple spacing. In both cases, the authors stated that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion. Ni, Branch, Chen, and Clinton conducted a similar study in 2009 using identical spacing variables. The authors concluded that the \"results provided insufficient evidence that time and comprehension differ significantly among different conditions of spacing between sentences\". A 2018 study of 60 students found that those who used two word spaces between sentences read the same text 3 percent faster than with a monospaced font (Courier New).\n\nRelated studies \nThere are other studies that could be relevant to sentence spacing, such as the familiarity of typographic conventions on readability. Some studies indicate that \"tradition\" can increase the readability of text, and that reading is disrupted when conventional printing arrangements are disrupted or violated. The standard for the Web and published books, magazines, and newspapers is single sentence spacing.\n\nDavid Jury's book What is Typography? notes, \"Changes in spacing either between letters and words, or between the words only ... do not appear to affect legibility. [These rather extraordinary conclusions are contrary to all other surveys on readability of texts.]\"\n\nA widespread observation is that increased sentence spacing creates \"rivers\" or \"holes\" within text, making it visually unattractive, distracting, and difficult to locate the end of sentences. Comprehensive works on typography describe the negative effect on readability caused by inconsistent spacing, which is supported in a 1981 study which found that \"comprehension was significantly less accurate with the river condition.\" Another 1981 study on Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays concluded that \"more densely packed text is read more efficiently … than is more loosely packed text.\" This statement is supported in other works as well. Canadian typographer Geoffrey Dowding suggests possible explanations of this phenomenon:A carefully composed text page appears as an orderly series of strips of black separated by horizontal channels of white space. Conversely, in a slovenly setting the tendency is for the page to appear as a grey and muddled pattern of isolated spats, this effect being caused by the over-widely separated words. The normal, easy, left-to-right movement of the eye is slowed down simply because of this separation; further, the short letters and serifs are unable to discharge an important function – that of keeping the eye on \"the line\". The eye also tends to be confused by a feeling of vertical emphasis, that is, an up & down movement, induced by the relative isolation of the words & consequent insistence of the ascending and descending letters. This movement is further emphasized by those \"rivers\" of white which are the inseparable & ugly accompaniment of all carelessly set text matter.Some studies suggest that readability can be improved by breaking sentences into separate units of thought—or varying the internal spacing of sentences. Mid-20th century research on this topic resulted in inconclusive findings. A 1980 study split sentences into 1–5 word phrases with additional spacing between segments. The study concluded that there was no significant difference in efficacy, but that a wider study was needed. Numerous other similar studies in 1951–1991 resulted in disparate and inconclusive findings. Finally, although various studies have been conducted on the readability of proportional vs. monospaced fonts, the studies typically did not decrease sentence spacing when using proportional fonts, or did not specify whether sentence spacing was changed.\n\nSee also\n Leading\n Scriptio continua\n\nNotes and references\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPunctuation\nTypography\nWhitespace"}
{"id": "4103966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minera", "title": "Minera", "text": "Minera (; ) is a village and community in Wrexham County Borough, Wales. It adjoins the village of Coedpoeth.\n\nThe community, which in addition to Minera village includes a number of smaller hamlets such as Gwynfryn and New Brighton and large areas of farmland, had a total population of 1,608 at the 2001 census, increasing slightly to 1,617 at the 2011 Census.\n\nHistory\nThe name Minera has an unusual source, being derived from the low Latin for \"mine\" or \"ore\". This name was recorded as early as 1339. The parallel Welsh name Mwynglawdd translates roughly as \"ore mine\".\n\nIn common with many Welsh settlements, Minera did not develop as a compact 'village' in the English understanding of the word until the 19th century. Under the manorial administration imposed after the mediaeval English conquest of Wales, Minera existed as a manor and township within the Lordship of Bromfield. Unlike many of the surrounding manors, such as Esclusham, Eglwysegle and Ruabon, land tenure within Minera was mostly servile, rather than free.\n\nThe history of Minera is closely related to that of its lead mines. Although earlier use, dating back perhaps as far as the Roman occupation, has been suggested, the first clear documentary evidence of the industry appears during the reign of Edward I, when miners from Minera were sent to Cornwall to help develop the tin mining industry. Extraction of lead and coal was later joined by the quarrying of silica stone and limestone, with three lime kilns being recorded in operation at Minera Mill in 1620. Further industrial development took place in the 19th century. The lead mines expanded under the guidance of engineer John Taylor and the Minera Limeworks came into operation, while a branch of the North Wales Mineral Railway was built in 1844 to serve the area.\n\nGovernance\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches north to Broughton and at the 2011 Census had a population of 2,472.\n\nChurches\nThere is thought to have been a \"chapel of ease\" to Wrexham parish church as early as 1577: built of wood, it was successively rebuilt in 1728-33 and 1815. The growing population of the area meant that Minera (previously a township of the parish of Wrexham) was created as a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1844. In 1864-5 the old church, which had become dilapidated, was demolished and a new church built to designs by Kennedy and Rogers of Bangor, preserving the outlines and interior of the old building. Minera's first Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1804; it was originally named Minera Chapel, but in 1859, it was renamed Pen-y-Bryn.\n\nRecent history\n\nThe lead and zinc mining industry declined in the early years of the 20th century, the mines finally closing in 1914 (the engine house of the Meadow Shaft remained standing in a derelict condition until the early 1990s, when it was restored). Despite the loss of its traditional industries the village of Minera expanded rapidly in the period after World War II, thanks to the construction of council housing estates.\n\nThe civil parish of Minera, whose boundaries approximated those of the old township of Minera, was replaced by the community of Minera under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972; the records of the old Minera Parish Council are held in the Denbighshire Record Office.\n\nFootball\n\nReports exist of the short-lived Minera Rovers and Minera Victoria contesting the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1890 and 1891. By 1898 another local team, Minera St Marys, had joined the Denbighshire League. Minera St Marys only lasted one season in this competition, taking on the fixtures of Cerney Swifts and finishing second from bottom.\n\nWhilst other Minera teams existed, none competed in any recognised leagues again until 1981 when Minera joined Welsh National League Wrexham Area Division 4. The team spent three seasons in Division 4 before finishing third in 1984 and gaining promotion to Welsh National League Wrexham Area Division 2 (formerly Division 3, renamed in 1984 following introduction of Premier Division). Minera stayed in this division until 1990 when they folded.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBBC Wales mini-site.\nMinera History\nphotos of Minera and surrounding area on geograph\n\nVillages in Wrexham County Borough\nCommunities in Wrexham County Borough\nThe Lordship of Bromfield and Yale\nWards of Wrexham County Borough"}

This occurred in a series of engagements called the Battle of Gazala. One of these engagements was Rommel's attack against Allied forces near Tobruk was on 13 June 1942. The 21st Panzer Division attacked South African positions on Rigel Ridge in the middle of a sandstorm. This was the 6th South African Anti-tank battery of the 2nd field regiment. The South African gunners kept firing until all their guns were destroyed, allowing the withdrawal of other Allied formations. The guns were commanded individually and fired at the Panzers over open sights. The German tanks took up positions behind the ridge with anti-tank guns placed between them. The Germans put down a devastating fire onto the South African positions. One of the columns of Panzers attacked them from the rear, surrounding them and cutting off all escape. Nevertheless, the gunners kept firing until all eight guns had been destroyed. About half the gun detachments were killed and wounded, including the battery commander and many officers. When the battery had been silenced, the enemy tanks approached cautiously and the South African gunners were made prisoners. The entire Natal Field Artillery Regiment was captured and would not be re-formed until after the war.

{"id": "4103995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lace%20%28miniseries%29", "title": "Lace (miniseries)", "text": "Lace is an American television miniseries, based on the 1982 novel of the same name by author Shirley Conran. The series aired on ABC on February 26–27, 1984. The plot concerns the search by film star Lili (Phoebe Cates) for her natural mother, who surrendered her for adoption as a newborn. Lace was one of the highest-rated television movies of the 1983–84 television season.\n\nLili's line \"Incidentally, which one of you bitches is my mother?\", addressed to her three maternal candidates — Pagan Trelawney (Brooke Adams), Judy Hale (Bess Armstrong) and Maxine Pascal (Arielle Dombasle) — was named the best line in television history by TV Guide in its 1993 issue celebrating 40 years of television.\n\nPlot\n\nThe story opens circa 1980 at an abandoned chateau in the Swiss Alps, once a prestigious boarding school, L'Hirondelle. Internationally famous film siren, Lili, travels from there to a private meeting with the elderly Hortense Boutin, whom Lili knows was paying money on behalf of one of the school's students to a family which adopted the student's illegitimate child. Lili is the child, now grown up.\n\nThe story flashes back to 1960, introducing schoolgirls Pagan Trelawney, Judy Hale, and Maxine Pascal. Each becomes entangled with a man – Pagan with Prince Abdullah of Sydon, Judy with banker Nick Cliffe, and Maxine with ice hockey player Pierre Boursal. All three romances fail, but one of the women becomes pregnant. Knowing it means ruin for the unwed mother, the three make a pact to protect her identity. All three present themselves to the local doctor, Dr. Geneste, and he agrees to assist in having the child adopted. When the doctor discovers the identity of the mother-to-be, he says, \"Of the three of you, you are the one I least suspected.\" The child, Elizabeth Lace, is born on November 17, 1960. The mother's birth name is recorded as Lucinda Lace.\n\nAn attempt by the school's headmaster Monsieur Chardin to expel the girls is thwarted when they unearth photographs of him in a homosexual tryst with the school's chauffeur, Paul. They blackmail Chardin into allowing them to stay and graduating them with honors. The child is placed with a foster family. On their behalf, Maxine's aunt, Hortense Boutin, agrees to pay money to Felix and Angelina Dassin, a French couple who consent to raise the child until her real mother establishes herself and can come back for her someday.\n\nThe three girls, on the verge of success in their respective careers, receive a report that the child has been killed in an auto accident. Consumed with guilt and shame, the three friends have a falling out and go their separate ways. In fact, Lili survived. Felix and Angelina were gunned down by Hungarian Soldiers after the accident. She was placed in a detention camp on the Eastern Bloc, where she spent the next ten years before finally escaping and eventually transforms herself into a film sex symbol.\n\nEmploying a private investigator, Lili tracks the payments to her adopted parents to Hortense, and through her, finds out about the three school friends and their pact. She knows one of them is her mother. Pagan Trelawney is now Lady Swann, a British aristocrat and the wife of a cancer researcher; Judy Hale has become a journalist, war correspondent, and publisher of Lace magazine; while Maxine Pascal is now the Countess de Chazalle, a French socialite. Hortense insists to Lili that the child is dead. But Lili defiantly proclaims \"They'll wish I was. They made their schoolgirl pact and sent me to Hell--I'll teach them what I learned there!\" As she leaves, the revelation proves to be too much for Hortense to bear and she suffers a fatal heart attack and dies.\n\nAfter Hortense's funeral, which Maxine, Pagan and Judy all attend and where she witnesses the extent of their estrangement from one another, Lili inveigles herself in the lives of the three women, promising each of them something of value: for Judy, an exclusive interview for her magazine; to Pagan, a very sizable donation to her cancer society charity and for Maxine, to stop dating her son. But she also intends to ruin them if they do not reveal which of them is her mother. She assembles the three and challenges them with the mini-series' most famous line: \"Incidentally...which one of you bitches is my mother?\" The second part of the mini-series is driven largely by flashbacks to the three women's young adulthood, charting their career successes and returning occasionally to the present where all three are in the company of the woman who claims to be the abandoned daughter. Lili, at the end of the flashbacks, again tries to force a confession from them, but they still remain silent. Infuriated, Lili orders them to leave, but says she intends to keep the promises she made them regardless. As she ascends to her bedroom, she shocks the women by revealing the full details of her birth to the trio.\n\nLater in the hotel bar, Judy, Pagan and Maxine all confirm that Lili was telling the truth and they all humorously agree that she is better than all of them put together. Maxine comments that \"Well, at least she brought us all back together. I missed you - I really did\". That last declaration finally repairs their damaged relationship. They agree Lili must be told the truth with Judy stating that this time, Lili's real mother is on her own in doing so.\n\nLili receives a phone call from the hotel manager, telling her that her mother wants to see her. A pair of high heels can be seen walking up the stairs. Finally, Judy Hale comes into the room and beckons Lili to come closer. Lili slowly rises and walks toward Judy, and the two embrace.\n\nCrew\n\nLace was produced by Gary Adelson, Preston Fischer, Lynn Guthrie and David Jacobs. The original music, including the title theme, was composed by Nick Bicât. It was directed by William Hale, from a script by Elliott Baker.\n\nCast\n\n Judy Hale (Bess Armstrong)\n Pagan Trelawney (Brooke Adams)\n Maxine Pascal (Arielle Dombasle)\n \"Lili\", born Elizabeth Lace (Phoebe Cates)\n Prince Abdullah of Sydon (Anthony Higgins)\n Aunt Hortense Boutin (Angela Lansbury)\n Nick Cliffe (Simon Chandler)\n Pierre Boursal (François Guétary)\n Selma (Honor Blackman)\n Mrs. Trelawney (June Brown)\n Detective (Jacques Maury)\n Priest (Jacques Herlin)\n Mme Chardin (Ginette Garcin)\n M. Chardin (Herbert Lom)\n Dr. Geneste (Anthony Quayle)\n Nurse (Jenny Clève)\n Angelina (Syvie Herbert)\n Félix (Féodor Atkine)\n Serge (Pierre Olaf)\n Paul (Jonathan Hyde)\n Count Charles de Chazalle (Leigh Lawson)\n Sir Christopher Swann (Nickolas Grace)\n French Hotel owner (Rachel Salik)\n Woman in Paris (Chantal Neuwirth)\n Teresa (Dominique Blanc)\n Helga \"Piggy\" Fassbinder (Annette Badland)\n Rahman Qureshi (Prince Mustapha/Son of Prince Abdullah)\n\nVideo and DVD\n\nLace was released on home video in the UK and Germany through Warner Bros. on March 27, 1995. It was PAL format. The German release was a UK import. Both Lace and Lace II were released on DVD through the Warner Archive Collection in 2010, but Lace II was discontinued a few months later.\n\nSequel\n\nLace was followed by a two-part sequel, Lace II, which aired on ABC from May 5–6, 1985. The principal cast was identical to Lace, with two exceptions: Deborah Raffin replaced Bess Armstrong in the role of Judy Hale, and Michael Fitzpatrick replaced Simon Chandler as Nick Cliffe. The plot of Lace II involves Lili's search for the identity of her father. It used the marketing line \"Which one of you bastards is my father?\". The opening theme of the miniseries, \"No More Lies\" was composed by Nick Bicât and performed by Deniece Williams. We learn in the end that Lili's father is Prince Abdullah of Sydon, who raped Judy on her way back to school after a one-night stand with Nick Cliffe, who was already engaged.\n\nLace II was considered a flop because it received half the audience of its predecessor. The story was criticized for \"romanticizing\" sexual assault.\n\nBook\n\nThe novel on which Lace is based, also titled Lace, was written by Shirley Conran. It was first published in the United States by Simon & Schuster on July 1, 1982. The hardcover edition ran to 604 pages.\n\nIn the book there is a fourth \"mother\", a journalist named Kate, but this character does not appear in the adaptation, in which Judy is a journalist.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\n1984 American television series debuts\n1984 American television series endings\nAmerican Broadcasting Company original programming\n1980s American television miniseries\nTelevision shows based on British novels\nTelevision series about adoption"}
{"id": "4104015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embsay", "title": "Embsay", "text": "Embsay is a village in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. It is paired with the neighbouring hamlet of Eastby to form the civil parish of Embsay with Eastby. The parish population as of the 2011 census was 1,871.\n\nGeography\nAt the foot of Embsay Crag, a rock formation north of the village, is Embsay Reservoir. The crag marks the start of Barden Moor, an expanse of open moorland which is open access land and used by walkers. There are two more reservoirs on the moor: Upper Barden Reservoir and Lower Barden Reservoir. Embsay reservoir is the headquarters of Craven Sailing Club.\n\nHistory\nEmbsay was originally a Celtic settlement, possibly founded at the same time as a local monastery, destroyed in a Viking raid in 867 AD. The village has a Saxon name and is listed in the Doomsday Book as \"Embesie\", which translates as \"Embe's enclosure\". At that time, much of the area was wooded and this was progressively cleared over time to provide farmland. In 1120, Cecily de Romille and her husband founded Embsay Priory. The Augustinian members of the priory dedicated it to Saint Cuthbert and received local tithes. In 1154 they exchanged estates with the de Romille family and moved to Bolton Abbey, which was a more fertile location. The priory flourished and grew rich on the profits of sheep farming and wool trading. In 1305, Edward I granted a charter for an annual fair at Embsay.  The Industrial Revolution resulted in several mills being built in Embsay.\n\nCommunity \nEmbsay Village Hall events include film nights, pantomimes, bowls, and jumble sales.\n\nThe village has a newsagent on the main road. The dedicated post office closed; a counter in a newspaper shop now serves as a post office. Other businesses in Embsay are a hairdresser and an arts and crafts store. Embsay has two public houses: the Elm Tree Inn and the Cavendish Arms. The Elm Tree Inn and Elm Tree Square take their names from a tree that stood there for many years. It was replaced in the late 20th century because of Dutch elm disease, but in 2006 that replacement was also taken down. A further replacement was planted in 2007.\n\nThe village has a Church of England voluntary controlled primary school which receives pupils from Embsay, Skipton and farther away. It was ranked the 141st best primary school in England in 2000, and had risen to 84th place by 2003.\n\nEmbsay railway station was built in 1888, and is the current terminus of the heritage Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway. There is a bus service between Embsay and Skipton eight times a day on weekdays and three on Saturdays.\n\nThe village has a cricket club that competes in the Craven League; its second team was, in 2006, the first second team in the league's history to play in the first division. The village also has a football club. Both clubs play at the same ground on Shires Lane at the north of the village. The club grounds are named the 'Robinson Memorial' after a local family who supported the club. Also at the north of the village is a recreational ground with a climbing frame and small football pitch.\n\nFilming location\nIn the 2018 BBC One television series The ABC Murders, Embsay is the location of the fifth murder. Scenes were filmed at the Embsay railway station.\n\nNotable people\nRon Fawcett, rock climber, born in Embsay\nRobert Sidgwick, amateur first-class cricketer, born in Embsay\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\n Embsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway, Stringer Communications International, Ltd.\n Embsay & Bolton Abbey Steam Railway, UK Individual web site\n AboutBritain.com \"Embsay, North Yorkshire Photo Gallery\", Aboutbritain.com\n Embsay with Eastby Parish Council website\n\nVillages in North Yorkshire\nCraven District"}

He started and ended his football career at Faroese side KÍ Klaksvík.\n\nHe has played 45 matches for Faroe Islands national football team and is currently (2018) number two on the top goal scorer's list with 9 goals. Jónsson is the highest scoring foreign football player in the Danish Superliga (Premier League) with 72 goals. He was previously the all-time top scorer for FC København together with Lars Højer Nielsen, they both scored 54 goals for FCK, but they have later been surpassed by Cesar Santin and Dame N'Doye.\n\nClub career \nJónsson spent a large portion of his career at the Danish Superliga side FC Copenhagen, having arrived in 1997 from Lyngby BK together with the new CEO Flemming Østergaard. Todi, as he is known by the FC Copenhagen fans, is one of the all-time leading goal scorers for the club and a member of the Hall of Fame as decided by fan club voting. From 1997 to 2005 he played 207 matches for FC Copenhagen and scored 68 goals.\n\nOn 25 June 2009, it was announced that Jónsson had rejoined KÍ Klaksvík, who, however, were unable to maintain their place in the Faroese top division. He ended his football career with the club where he started. He played his last match for KÍ Klaksvík on 3 October 2009 against EB/Streymur.\n\nInternational career\nIn the Faroe Islands, Jónsson is arguably the most successful football player of all time, having played at an internationally high level for the better part of a decade with the Danish Champions FC Copenhagen. Furthermore, Todi was the most successful goalscorer for the Faroe Islands national football team with 9 goals in 45 caps, until Rógvi Jacobsen scored his 9th goal against Lithuania in September 2007, then fully overtaking Todi's record away to Italy two months later. Todi is also the only Faroese player to score a hat-trick in an international match. (Bergur Magnussen scored 6 times in the match against the Åland Islands back in 1989, but this match is not officially recognised.)\n\nTodi is remembered for his premature and controversial international retirement in the spring of 2001, as he decided to concentrate fully on his club career.

She was six years his junior.\n\nLife\n\nFamily background\nImperial Noble Consort Zhuangjing's personal name was not recorded in history.\n\n Father: Qinghai (), served as a sixth rank literary official ()\n\nDaoguang era\nThe future Imperial Noble Consort Zhuangjing was born on the 27th day of the second lunar month in the 17th year of the reign of the Daoguang Emperor, which translates to 2 April 1837 in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nXianfeng era\nOn 26 June 1852, Lady Tatara entered the Forbidden City and was granted the title \"Noble Lady Li\" by the Xianfeng Emperor. During Lady Tatara's time as a consort of the Xianfeng Emperor, she was said to be the most beautiful woman in the Imperial City and was bestowed with a natural grace and allure. Written descriptions about the beauty of Lady Tatara are among the most illustrious and elaborate of Qing dynasty historical texts; they somewhat differ from the passive mentions of beauty and virtue in descriptions of other Qing dynasty imperial consorts and better resemble vivid descriptions of beauties in the historical records of earlier Han Chinese-led dynasties.\n\nOn 10 February 1855, Lady Tatara was elevated to \"Concubine Li\". On 20 June 1855, she gave birth to the emperor's only daughter, Princess Rong'an of the First Rank. Due to the emperor's intense and near monopolic love for her, their daughter was made a first rank princess against tradition. According to Qing dynasty imperial regulations, only the daughters of empresses were qualified to be first rank princesses; all other daughters of the emperor were to be second rank princesses.\n\nOn 4 February 1856, Lady Tatara was elevated to \"Consort Li\". It is said that Lady Tatara was the Xianfeng Emperor's favourite and most charming consort, and that he spent most of his nights with her. On the other hand, Lady Yehe Nara, another of the emperor's consorts, only caught the emperor's attention during and after Lady Tatara's pregnancy. This was because the emperor was not allowed to have sexual relations with Lady Tatara in the 100 days after she gave birth.\n\nIn 1860, Lady Tatara fled with the Xianfeng Emperor, his empress consort, and other consorts to Rehe Province when Anglo-French forces closed in on Beijing during the Second Opium War.\n\nTongzhi era\nThe Xianfeng Emperor died on 22 August 1861 and was succeeded by Lady Yehe Nara's son, Zaichun, who was enthroned as the Tongzhi Emperor. Because Lady Tatara had served the Xianfeng Emperor for many years, and was widely acknowledged as the emperor's favourite consort, she was elevated to \" “Imperial Noble Consort Dowager Li\". During this time, she lived in the Palace of Eternal Harmony (永和宮) in the eastern part of the Forbidden City.\n\nGuangxu era\nThe Tongzhi Emperor died on 12 January 1875 and was succeeded by his cousin Zaitian, who was enthroned as the Guangxu Emperor. Lady Tatara's daughter died on 5 February 1875 after suffering a miscarriage upon hearing news of the death of her brother (the Tongzhi Emperor).\n\nOfficial histories recorded that Lady Tatara was often sick and she died from illness on 26 December 1890. The Guangxu Emperor ordered members of the imperial clan and officials to wear mourning garments for a day. In 1893, Lady Tatara was buried in the Ding Mausoleum of the Eastern Qing tombs, alongside Noble Consort Wen, who died seven days before her. She was granted the posthumous title \"Imperial Noble Consort Zhuangjing\".\n\nTitles\n During the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (r. 1820–1850):\n Lady Tatara (from 2 April 1837)\n During the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor (r. 1850–1861):\n Noble Lady Li (; from 26 June 1852), sixth rank consort\n Concubine Li (; from 10 February 1855), fifth rank consort\n Consort Li (; from 4 February 1856), fourth rank consort\n During the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor (r. 1861–1875):\n Imperial Noble Consort Dowager Li (; from 12 November 1861), second rank consort\n During the reign of the Guangxu Emperor (r. 1875–1908):\n Imperial Noble Consort Zhuangjing (; from 1890)\n\nIssue\n As Concubine Li:\n Princess Rong'an of the First Rank (; 20 June 1855 – 5 February 1875), the Xianfeng Emperor's first daughter\n Married Fuzhen (d. 1909) of the Manchu Gūwalgiya clan in September/October 1873\n\nIn fiction and popular culture\n Portrayed by Chow Kit in The Burning of Imperial Palace (1983) and Reign Behind a Curtain (1983)\n Portrayed by Bai Qinglin in Sigh of His Highness (2006)\n\nSee also\n Ranks of imperial consorts in China#Qing\n Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n\n1837 births\n1890 deaths\nConsorts of the Xianfeng Emperor\nManchu nobility"}

In 1996 Sri Chinmoy created this event as a 2,700-mile (4,345 km) race. At the award ceremony that year he declared that the 1997 edition would be extended to 3,100 miles (4,989 km).\n\nThis race, which lasts several weeks, is hosted by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team and takes place every summer in Queens, New York, United States. The course is 3,100 miles (4,989 km) long. Runners negotiate 5,649 laps of one extended city block in Jamaica, Queens, bounded by 164th Place, Abigail Adams (84th) Avenue, 168th Street, and Grand Central Parkway— a distance of 0.5488 miles (883 m)—while the streets are in normal use. The runners have 52 days to complete the distance, running from 6 a.m. to midnight, an average of 59.62 miles (95.95 km) every day. The prize is typically a T-shirt, a DVD, or a small trophy.\n\nHistory \nThe Self-Transcendence 3100 mile was founded by Sri Chinmoy out of his wish to create an opportunity for runners to discover the limits of their capacities and to try to go beyond them. Hence, the name \"Self-Transcendence\", which is appended to many of the footraces that the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team hosts. Since 1985 when the group first began holding races, the focus on the ultramarathon and multiday races has grown from the Ultra Trio, three races with staggered starts of 700, 1000 and 1300-mile duration that take place in September, and the spring races, which include the Self-Transcendence 6-Day race and one of a very few such races in the world, the Self-Transcendence 10-Day race.\n\nIn 1996 Sri Chinmoy created this event as a 2,700-mile (4,345 km) race. At the award ceremony that year he declared that the 1997 edition would be extended to 3,100 miles (4,989 km). The length of 3,100 is possibly a reference to the birth year of Sri Chinmoy, 1931. The race has been run at this distance every year since.\n\nIn 2020, it was held in Salzburg, Austria due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from September 13 to November 3.\n\nIn 2021, with the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, organisers decided to move the start date for the race from its usual date, mid-June, to Sunday September 5, 2021.\n\n11 runners were selected for 2022 and the race took place from Sunday September 4 to Tuesday October 25.\n\nRace \nThe race distance is the distance from the west to the east coast of the US, plus 11 marathons. In the early years there were drug dealers in the area and lawlessness—people did not want to leave their cars, which would have been stripped—but this has changed over the years. For their safety, only runners with proven ultra-running experience are encouraged to apply. The race is run daily, changing direction each day, whatever the weather, which has ranged from  heat to torrential downpour—runners sometimes carry umbrellas. Competitors run among people going about their everyday lives, dodging pedestrians and cyclists, and occasionally large crowds for various events or celebrations.\n\nSri Chinmoy said that the Self-Transcendence challenges runners to \"transcend their own previous capacity\", \"gain spiritual insights\" and \"overcome the entire world's pre-conceived notions of possibility\". Runners have spoken of \"the most overwhelming moment\", \"When you run a marathon, you feel good ... when you run 3,100 miles, you feel even better still\".\n\nVegetarian meals are provided by volunteers from an improvised kitchen; runners need to eat constantly, burning 10,000 kcal a day. Runners have six hours at night for eating, washing, foot care and sleep before returning to the course for the 6:00am start.\n\nThe race can be followed on the race website; regular updates for the participants are published there, and a webcam has been operating during recent years. An album of photo images is also published, several days a week, to record race activity.\n\nRecords and winners\n\nRecords \nThe world record is held by Ashprihanal Aalto (FIN) who finished with a time of 40 days 09:06:21 in July 2015, breaking the previous record of 41 days 08:16:29 held by Madhupran Wolfgang Schwerk (GER). The women's record is held by Kaneenika Janakova (SVK) who completed 3100 miles in 48 days 14:24:10 in 2017. She broke the 49 days 07:52:24 record set by Surasa Mairer (AUT) in 2015. Suprabha Beckjord (USA) is the only person to have completed every edition of the race (until 2009).

{"id": "4104076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do%C4%9Fubayaz%C4%B1t", "title": "Doğubayazıt", "text": "Doğubayazıt (; ) is a town of Ağrı Province of Turkey, near the border with Iran. Its elevation is 1625 m. It is the seat of Doğubayazıt District. Its population is 80,061 (2021). Also known as Kurdava, the town was the capital of the self-declared Republic of Ararat, an independent Kurdish state centered in the Ağrı Province.\n\nHistory\n\nFor most of the periods described here, Doğubayazıt was a bigger and more important settlement than the present-day provincial capital Ağrı, not least because this is the Iranian border crossing.\n\nThe area has had a rich history with monuments dating back to the time of the Kingdom of Urartu (over 2700 years ago). Before the Ottoman Empire the site was referred to by its Armenian name Daruynk.  In the 4th century the Sasanians failed to capture the Armenian stronghold and royal treasury at Daroynk. Princes of the Bagratid dynasty of Armenia resided at Daroynk and rebuilt the fortress into its present configuration with multiple baileys and towers carefully integrated into the ascending rock outcrop. When King Gagik I Artsruni reoccupied the fortress ca.922 A.D. it became the seat of a bishop.  It was subsequently conquered and reconquered by Persians, Armenians, Byzantines, and Seljuks all of whom would have used the plain to rest and recoup during their passages across the mountains.  Turkish peoples arrived in 1064, but were soon followed by the Mongols and further waves of Turks. The castle of Daroynk was repaired many times throughout this history, although it is now named after the Turkish warlord Celayırlı Şehzade Bayazıt Han who ordered one of the rebuildings (in 1374). Ultimately, the town was renamed Beyazit itself in the 16th century.\n\nFrom the time of the Safavids, the area was ruled by Turkic-speaking generals, later including the Ottoman general İshakpaşa, who built the palace that still bears his name.\n\nThe town saw fighting in the Ottoman–Persian War (1821–23) when in 1821 commander-in-chief Abbas Mirza of Qajar Iran occupied the town, as well as when it was attacked by Russia later in 1856, and taken by the Russians during the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78). When the Russians retreated many of the Armenian population left with them to build New Beyazit (now Gavar at Armenia) on the shore of lake Sevan.\n\nDoğubayazıt was further ravaged during World War I and the Turkish War of Independence\n\nStarting in 1920, the area began producing sulphur.\n\nThe widely dispersed village of Bayazit, was originally an Armenian settlement and populated by Kurds in 1930 and Yazidis from the Serhat region. But in 1930 the Turkish army destroyed it in response to the Ararat Rebellion. A new town was built in the plain below the old site in the 1930s (hence the new name \"Doğubayazıt\", which literally means \"East Beyazıt\").\n\nDoğubayazıt was the capital of the Kurdish Republic of Ararat led by Ibrahim Haski and Ihsan Nuri of the Xoybûn organization between 1927 and 1930. The town was thus dubbed the provisional capital of Kurdistan and was subsequently presented to the League of Nations and the Great Powers as the center of an independent Kurdish state.\n\nIn January 2006, Doğubayazıt was the centre of a H5N1 bird flu outbreak. Several children died from the disease after playing with chicken carcasses.\n\nPolitics \n\nIn the local elections in March 2019, Yıldız Acar was elected Mayor of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP).\n\nSports \nThe Doğubayazıtspor football club plays in the lower divisions of the Turkish football league. It played in the Turkish Third League for three seasons.\n\nGeography  \n\nThe town of Doğubayazıt is a settlement with a long history. It lies 15 km southwest of Mount Ararat, 93 km east of the city of Ağrı and 35 km from the Iranian border. The town stands on a plain surrounded by some of Turkey's highest peaks including: Ararat (5,137 m), Little Ararat (3,896 m), Tendürek Dağı (3,533 m), Kaletepe (3,196 m) Arıdağı (2,934 m) and Göllertepe (2,643 m). Kizil Mountain at 2,730 m is two kilometers east of the town.

{"id": "4104102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paw%20Paws", "title": "Paw Paws", "text": "Paw Paws (also known as Paw Paw Bears) is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that first aired in 1985 and 1986. It debuted as part of the weekday/weekend morning programming block The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera.\n\nThe series name is a play on the paw paw, a fruit cultivated by Native Americans and indigenous to North America, and a play on words with a bear's paw. Reruns of the show formerly aired on Cartoon Network and later Boomerang.\n\nPlot\nDeep in a forest somewhere, a group of Native American bear cubs defending themselves from their enemies The Meanos led by the evil sorcerer Dark Paw. Dark Paw and his henchmen were after the Paw Paws' three large wooden totems, Totem Bear, Totem Tortoise, and Totem Eagle. The totems also served as the tribe's protectors, coming to life when needed through means of Princess Paw Paw's Mystic Moonstone, which she wore around her neck, to defend the village.\n\nMuch like other Hanna-Barbera programs, such as The Smurfs, The Biskitts, Shirt Tales, Snorks and the Pound Puppies, the bears had names that denoted their personalities—Laughing Paw, Medicine Paw, Bumble Paw, etc. Brave Paw and Princess Paw Paw tended to be the leads, riding into adventures on their magical flying ponies, while aging Wise Paw served as tribal advisor. The mascot of the group was a tiny dog by the name of PaPooch.\n\nCharacters\n\nPaw Paws\n Wise Paw (voiced by John Ingle) – He is the chief leader of the Paw Paws. He is the oldest and wisest of the tribe.\n Princess Paw Paw (voiced by Susan Blu) – She is Wise Paw's daughter. Princess Paw Paw is beautiful and cares for everyone and the village. She carries around the Mystic Moonstone which has the power to bring Totem Bear, Tortoise and Eagle to life. When she blows on her whistle, she can summon her flying horse Flying Cloud. Paw Paws introduced the cartoon world to Susan Blu, who went to do the original voice of Arcee in Hasbro's cartoon series The Transformers as well as many other animated characters.\n Flying Cloud - Princess Paw Paw's flying horse. She is beautiful just like the Princess Paw. Later on the series, she fell in love with the Black Stallion and they started a family have two baby flying horses.\n Brave Paw (voiced by Thom Pinto) – Brave Paw is the Princess's closest friend and presumably her boyfriend. He is courageous and willing to rescue his fellow Paw Paws from danger and fight the forces of evil. Aside from the Princess, he is the only other Paw Paw who rides a flying horse.\n Golden Thunder - Golden Thunder is Brave Paw's flying horse. He can summon Golden Thunder from Thunder Mountain simply by calling his name.\n Mighty Paw (voiced by Robert Ridgely) – He is the biggest and strongest of the Paw Paws, although a bit slow.\n Laughing Paw (voiced by Alexandra Stoddart) – She is younger than the Princess and is known for her sense of humor.\n PaPooch (vocal effects provided by Don Messick) – Laughing Paw's pet puppy. He is loyal and brave, but always gets into trouble. A play on the Narragansett term papoose.\n Trembly Paw (voiced by Howard Morris) – He is the coward of the tribe and would rather run from danger, although occasionally he would do heroic deeds.\n Medicine Paw (voiced by Jerry Dexter impersonating W.C. Fields) – He is the shaman of the tribe, but he is a bit of a quack. He appeared in only a few episodes.\n Totem Animals – They are the main protectors of the village. The Totem Animals can be awakened by the Mystic Moonstone wielded by Princess Paw Paw to fight off the Meanos.\n Totem Eagle - The top Totem Animal. He serves as the air transportation.\n Totem Bear (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker) - The middle Totem Animals. He is usually the one who attacks first after Totem Eagle flies off his head and would often send the Meanos flying.\n Totem Tortoise - The bottom Totem Animal. Totem Tortoise's main function is water transportation.\n\nVillains\n Meanos - The Meanos are the main antagonists of the series. They often attack the Paw Paws until they are defeated by them and the Totem Animals.\n Dark Paw (voiced by Stanley Ralph Ross) – Chief of the Meanos. He carries around a magic staff which he typically uses to zap his enemies...and, when they get on Dark Paw's bad side, his own cohorts. Dark Paw is not as bright as he thinks he is. His personality echoes that of Moe Howard from The Three Stooges.\n Slippery Paw – He is better known for his greasy long hair than for his intelligence, but he's still smarter than Bumble Paw.\n Bumble Paw (voiced by Frank Welker) – He is the shortest and dumbest of the group.\n Aunt Pruney (voiced by Ruth Buzzi) – Aunt Pruney is Dark Paw's aunt, but she is also a witch who rides a vacuum cleaner instead of a broom. She complains to her nephew that he never calls or writes. Aunt Pruney is often disappointed at his constant failures and even helps him out. Aunt Pruney and Wise Paw knew each other personally.\n The Greedy Greenies – They are green slimy monsters seen in a few episodes. They are mostly featureless, except for a pair of eyes, and have voracious appetites. They ate most of the PawPaw village including houses, poles, laundry, and food, with a mixture of sucking and enveloping (similar to phagocytosis, but on a much larger scale) They prefer to come at night, and only make gurgling noises. They can burrow through the ground at will, and sometimes leave behind \"puddles\" that are actually tunnels, that others (such as Dark Paw and PaPooch) have fallen into, but these can be closed at will. They live in a hidden underground complex near the Paw Paw village. Intruders are lowered into a pool of goo that will cover the victim and eventually assimilate it, turning him or her into another Greenie. Even Dark Paw is afraid of them.\n Great Greenie - The leader of the Greedy Greenies.\n\nOther characters\n Eugene the Genie (voiced by Scatman Crothers) – Eugene is a cat-like genie who is a friend of the Paw Paws. He has magic powers and a sassy attitude, especially towards Dark Paw. Eugene appeared in a few episodes.\n Nice Paw – Nice Paw is a former Meano who used to be called Nasty Paw. He was abducted by aliens and was reprogrammed into a good guy. Nice Paw has since traveled with the aliens and often returns to Earth.\n\nEpisodes list\n \"The Big Spill\" – While the Paw Paw bears take care of an injured duckling, the wicked Dark Paw and his Meanos cause a flood to steal the Princess's mystic moonstone.\n \"The Wishing Star Crystal\" – When Princess Paw Paw is put into an eternal sleep by a magic flower, courtesy of Dark Paw, her friends must take a perilous journey to find a magic crystal to awaken her.\n \"The Flying Horse Napper\" – Dark Paw steals the Princess's magic whistle that allows her to summon Flying Cloud and plans to use the flying horse to get a potion from his Aunt Pruney on Shriek Peak.\n \"The Creepy Cave Creature\" – After preventing the Paw Paws from calling Totem Bear, Dark Paw puts a large creature under his control to attack their village.\n \"The Greedie Greenies\" – When green blobs descend on the village and eat everything in sight, the Paw Paws must come to the rescue of their worst enemy, Dark Paw.\n \"The Rise of the Evil Spirits\" – When ancient spirits of evil awaken after 200 years to cause trouble for the Paw Paws, Dark Paw tries to gain control of them and finally take over the village.\n \"The Genie-athalon\" – When Eugene the Genie's lamp is uncovered and everyone tries to claim it, the Paw Paws compete against the cheating Dark Paw to win his three wishes.\n \"The Golden Falcon\" – When the Great Totem disappears and a mysterious golden falcon statue appears, Dark Paw takes the opportunity to challenge Brave Paw to a fight.\n \"Honey of a Robbery\" – It's Wise Paw's 100th birthday, and Dark Paw plans on ruining the celebration by stealing the village's entire honey supply. \n \"Tot 'em Termi' Nation\" – Dark Paw brings the Black Stallion to lure away Flying Cloud and keep the Princess busy, so an army of termites can reduce the Great Totem to sawdust.\n \"Waif Goodbye to the Paw Paws\" – Dark Paw's Aunt Pruney helps him to take over the Paw Paw's village by disguising herself as a young and pretty Paw Paw.\n \"The Dark Totem Pole Monster\" – Dark Paw sets his sights on the moonstone around the neck of Totem Bear by building a giant mechanical version of himself, while Trembly Paw tries to help a young flying horse with a fear of flying.\n \"Dark Paw Under Wraps\" – When a flood uncovers the casket of a Paw Paw mummy, Dark Paw takes advantage of an ancient curse to take over as leader.\n \"Genie Without a Lamp\"\n \"Egging Dark Paw On\"\n \"Two Heads Are Better than One\"\n \"The Great Paw Paw Turnaround\"\n \"The Lost Lake Monster\"\n \"Totem Time Trip\"\n \"S'no Business\"\n \"The Zip Zap 4-D Trap\"\n\nMerchandising\nA line of Paw Paws toys were produced by Applause in 1985.

It is the seat of Düziçi District. Its population is 56,724 (2022). It is located in a small plain in the foothills of the Nur Mountains and 440 m above the sea level.\n\nDüziçi is on a route from the Middle East to Anatolia and has seen numerous armies and campaigns throughout the centuries. The historical names for this site are minor variations of Haruniye (Arabic: al-Hārūniyya(h); Armenian: Harun or Harunia; Crusader: Haronia or Aronia).  Its small castle is on an outcrop about 3 kilometers northeast of the town.\n\nHistory and Monuments\n\nThe ancient names of the city were Irenopolis and Neronias.\n\nThe fortress was built in A.D. 785/86 during the Abbasid Caliphate by Harun al-Rashid as a link in a chain of Arab defenses along the Nur Dağları, and named after him as al-Haruniyya. The Byzantine general Nicephorus Phocas captured the 1,500 residents of Haruniyya in 959. When it was recaptured by Emir of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla, in 967, the fort was repaired.  Following the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 nomadic Turks began to move into Anatolia and the nearby hills were temporarily settled by the Avşar tribe of the Turkmen.  At some point between the mid-12th century and 1198/99 it became the possession of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.  On January 22, 1236 the Armenian King Hethum I and his wife Isabella bestowed the castle and village of Haruniyya to the Knights of the Teutonic Order.\n\nThe plan of the local medieval fortress, Haruniye Kalesi, reveals a compact keep-like structure with a massive tower at the east, which protects a postern gate.  There are continuous galleries with pointed vaults in the north and west walls which are opened by embrasured arrow slits.  The main entrance is at the south.  Repairs to the castle may belong to the Teutonic Knights or the Mamluks.  The lower level of the large tower at the east may have functioned as a cistern.\n\nIn the late 13th century it was captured by the Egyptian Mamluks, who made Haruniyya the administrative center for eastern Cilicia in the mid-14th century.  The Ottomans took control in 1516 during the campaign against Egypt of Sultan Selim I. In the Ottoman period the town was still known as Haruniye.\n \nDüziçi is one of many places in the Çukurova area that claims association with the legendary 17th century folk-poet Karacaoğlan.\n\nThe town was occupied by the French forces after the First World War until the Turkish War of Independence.\n\nEducation\n1 High School of Science in the town center, 2 Anatolian High School, 1 Public High School, 1 Vocational and Technical High School, 1 Health Professions High School, 1 Commercial High School, 1 Multi-Program High School a total of 8 schools, including, in the hands District 1 General high school for a total of 9 high school, also one kindergarten, one 8 years 22 and 29 at 5 There is a total of 51 years, including elementary school.

It is the seat of Eğirdir District. Its population is 16,759 (2022).\n\nHistory\nThe town and the lake were formerly called Eğridir, a Turkish pronunciation and possible appropriation of the town's old Greek name Akrotiri. Moreover, the name \"Eğridir\" means '(It) is bent.'.\n\nThe town was founded by the Hittites before falling to the Phrygians in around 1200 BC, and subsequently being conquered by the Lydians, the Persians and the forces of Alexander the Great. The Romans called the town Prostanna. During the Byzantine era, when it acquired its name of Akrotiri (\"peninsula\"), it was the seat of a bishopric. The Seljuks conquered it around 1080 and held it until the Hamidoğulları tribe made it the capital of a small principality in 1280, which lasted until 1381. The 14th century traveller Ibn Battuta described it as \"a great and populous city with fine bazaars and running streams, mosques, fruit trees and orchards\", which was situated beside \"a lake of sweet water\". The Ottomans took control in 1417. Most of its population consisted of Greek Orthodox people until the population exchanges of the 1920s.\n\nFeatures\n\nEğirdir lies between Lake Eğirdir and the Mount Sivri, and contains the Eğirdir Castle said to have been built by Croesus, king of Lydia, although additions were built by the Romans, Byzantines, and Seljuks.\n\nThe population of Eğirdir was 19,469 in 2010, but swells in the summer months as part-time residents return for the holidays. Eğirdir is a fishing community and local residents fish in Lake Eğirdir year round.\n\nYeşil Ada (Turkish for \"green island\") is a small island connected to Eğirdir by a short causeway. Restaurants, hotels, pensions (pansyons or hostels), and a few private residences fill the island. Known for its past as a Greek village, Yeşıl Ada still has quite a few stone homes remaining from the Greek era.\n\nLocals claim that Eğirdir is home to the world's only walk-through minaret.\n\nSee also\nList of lakes in Turkey\nSirmione (Sirmio peninsula) on Lake Garda in Italy\n\nReferences\n\nGallery\n\nExternal links\n\n District municipality's official website \n Egirdir, Turkey Information Website \n\nPopulated places in Eğirdir District\nFishing communities in Turkey\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey\nCittaslow"}

It runs north to south and is about 5 km (3 miles) long. In places the floor of the glen is only 50 metres wide, with steep sides.\n\nThe Sulby River rises in the nearby Snaefell Mountain foothills and flows through the glen, and it also contains the A14 road. At the top of the glen the river emerges from the Sulby Reservoir (the largest reservoir in the island, created in 1982). At the bottom of the glen, about 1 km south of the village of Sulby, the river emerges into the island's northern plain. By the riverside just below this point is Sulby Claddagh, a local beauty spot and camp site.\n\nA small side valley branching from Sulby Glen near Sulby Reservoir is occupied by Tholt-y-Will Glen, one of the officially-listed Manx National Glens and the only one of these which is located in the mountainous centre of the island. This is managed, preserved and maintained in a semi-natural state by a government agency: the Forestry Amenity and Lands Directorate of the Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture. As at October 2017, access to Tholt-y-Will Glen was restricted due to a damaged bridge. At the entrance to Tholt-y-Will Glen is a small car park and picnic area.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nThe Isle of Man, Trevor Kneale, Pevensey Island Guides (2001). \nGlens on the Isle of Man: The Visitors' Pocket Guide.

Only 13 episodes were produced and originally broadcast on The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera in the United States starting on 31 January 1989.\n\nProduction\nThe original SuperTed, created by Mike Young became the first British cartoon series to be aired on Disney Channel in the United States in 1984. Young moved to the United States to work on more animated series and in 1988 he made a SuperTed-sequel-type cartoon called Fantastic Max (originally based on the cartoon pilot Space Baby) produced by Hanna-Barbera, who decided to create a new series of SuperTed.\n\nThis new American version of the show takes on a more epic format, with Texas Pete, Bulk and Skeleton also joined by new villains. The theme song was replaced with a more American overture, and the show poked fun at all aspects of American culture, from the Grand Ole Opry to Star Wars. Only two of the original cast were used for this new series, with Victor Spinetti and Melvyn Hayes returning to voice Texas Pete and Skeleton. Unlike the original, the series used digital ink and paint.\n\nIn the UK, Mike Young and the BBC decided to rerecord the series to use the original voices of Derek Griffiths for SuperTed and Jon Pertwee for Spotty, which also resulted in some minor script changes. The episodes were also split into two parts, thus creating 26 10-minute stories, which resulted in the series not being broadcast until January 1990 on the BBC. It was repeated again twice in 1992 and 1993.\n\nCharacters\n\nHeroes\n SuperTed (voiced by Derek Griffiths in the UK version, Danny Cooksey in the US version) - A teddy bear who was thrown aside of the rejects and brought to life by Spotty's cosmic dust, a be given special powers by Mother Nature.

{"id": "4104136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynodesme", "title": "Kynodesme", "text": "A kynodesmē (, English translation: \"dog tie\") was a cord or string or sometimes a leather strip that was worn primarily by athletes in Ancient Greece and Etruria to prevent the exposure of the glans penis in public (considered to be ill-mannered) and to restrict untethered movement of the penis during sporting competition. It was tied tightly around the akroposthion, the most distal, tubular portion of the foreskin that extends beyond the glans. As depicted in Ancient Greek art the kynodesme was worn by some athletes, actors, poets, symposiasts and komasts. It was worn temporarily while in public and could be taken off and put back on at will. The remaining length of cord could either be attached to a waist band to pull the penis upward and expose the scrotum, or tied around the base of the penis and scrotum so that the penis appeared to curl upwards.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe public exposure of the penis head was regarded by the Greeks as dishonourable and shameful, something only seen in slaves and barbarians. Modesty and decency demanded that men who showed themselves naked in a public setting, such as athletes or actors, must conceal their glans.\n\nThe usage of the kynodesme might have also helped to naturally elongate the foreskin, which was seen as desirable.\n\nIn Greek and Roman medical practice, the uncontrolled dispersing of semen was thought to weaken men, and was particularly thought to affect the quality of the masculine voice. In ancient Rome, this form of non-surgical infibulation might thus be used by singers as a regimen for preserving the voice.\n\nIn art\nIt is first alluded to in literature in the 5th century BC, in the partially preserved satyr play Theoroi  by Aeschylus. There is earlier evidence from the images of athletes on Ancient Greek pottery. The Kynodesme was also used by the Etruscans and Romans who called it a ligatura praeputii. The Romans however preferred to use a ring known as a fibula, rather than a band, to conceal the glans.\n\nSee also\n Codpiece (from Middle English: cod, meaning \"scrotum\") – a covering flap or pouch that attaches to the front  of men's trousers, enclosing the genital area\n Koteka – a penis sheath traditionally worn by native male inhabitants of some ethnic groups in New Guinea to cover their genitals\n Namba – a traditional penis sheath from Vanuatu\n A penile fibula is a ring, attached with a pin through the foreskin to fasten it above the glans penis\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n Hodges FM.

The road has three lanes in each direction for its entire length with full-width hard shoulders for emergencies and breakdowns. The speed limit is  for most of its length, the highest of any road in Hong Kong.\n\nNorth Lantau Highway is  in length, beginning at Airport Road on Chek Lap Kok. The road then crosses onto Lantau Island and bypasses Tung Chung New Town. The road then travels along the northern coast of Lantau Island, next to the Airport Express and Tung Chung line of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR). This section is built on reclaimed land and through various cuttings. Finally, the road climbs over Ta Shui Wan and Tsing Chau Wan to meet the Lantau Link and its bridges.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\nThe North Lantau Highway was built as part of the Airport Core Programme in the 1990s. The ultimate aim of the new motorway was to connect Hong Kong's urban core with the new international airport (opened 1998) as well as associated new town development in Tung Chung. Construction commenced in June 1992 to a design by Mott MacDonald Hong Kong.\n\nConstruction and opening \nRather than tendering the project as a single contract, which would have drawn bids from only the largest international contractors, the Hong Kong government opted to split the expressway into three separate phases that would be more manageable in scale to local companies, thereby drawing a more competitive range of bids. The contract to construct the Tai Ho Section, worth HK$3.5 billion, was awarded on 8 June 1992 to the Lantau Expressway Joint Venture, of which Downer Group was the lead contractor. The Yam O Section contract, worth $1.328 billion, was awarded on 14 September 1992 to a joint venture comprising Aoki Corporation, Franki Contractors, and Tobishima Corporation. Lastly, the Tung Chung Section contract, worth $969.1 million, was awarded on 27 September 1993 to a joint venture composed of China State, Leighton Asia and Hochtief.\n\nThe expressway opened to traffic on 22 May 1997. In the days leading up to the opening, officers of the Agriculture and Fisheries Department rounded up about 30 cattle who had wandered onto the highway during construction, when the perimeter fence was not fully enclosed.\n\nSunny Bay Interchange\nThe Sunny Bay Interchange came into operation in 2005, allowing traffic to exit the North Lantau Highway onto the new Penny's Bay Highway. This opened up access to Penny's Bay, which was reclaimed mainly for the new Hong Kong Disneyland.\n\n2008 flooding \nOn 7 June 2008, North Lantau Highway and its service road, , were completely flooded at Caribbean Coast, Tung Chung at 6am, under rainfall as high as  per hour. The highway was forced to close completely, rendering Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok inaccessible by road. With a water depth of , and the flood extending  in length, some 20 vehicles were trapped on the scene by the floodwater. Another thousand vehicles were trapped in the resulting traffic jam, extending about  back to the toll plaza of Lantau Link. Service was increased on the MTR Tung Chung line and Airport Express to alleviate passenger flow.\n\nThe highway was partially reopened starting from 4:00 pm that day.\n\nDesign\nAn early design for the North Lantau Highway was completed in the early 1980s. It was envisaged as a two-lane dual carriageway \"[hugging] the rugged northern coastline of Lantau\". However, the plan did not proceed at that time as the airport project was shelved by the government for financial reasons.\n\nThe Chek Lap Kok airport project was resurrected in 1989 under the governorship of David Wilson. In the same year, new motorways design standards were introduced in Hong Kong. In 1990, the highway was redesigned to reflect these new standards, and to take into account higher projected usage. The North Lantau Highway, as built, is a three-lane dual carriageway with a gentler grade and curvature than the earlier iteration. Hard shoulders of 3.3 metres are also provided on either side of the expressway.\n\nMost of the highway is built on reclaimed land. The fill for the land reclamation came from slope cuttings or marine borrow areas in Hong Kong, or was river sand imported from China.\n\nThe most significant bridge along the length of the road is located at the very end of the highway, linking Lantau and Chek Lap Kok. This multi-span structure, approximately 320 metres long, also carries a utility conduit serving the airport containing electricity, water, sewerage, telephone, and raw water connections. There are smaller bridges at Tai Ho Wan and Sham Shui Kok.\n\nInterchanges\n\n{| class=\"plainrowheaders wikitable\"\n|+  North Lantau Highway\n|-\n!scope=col|District\n!scope=col|Location\n!scope=col|km\n!scope=col|Interchange name\n!scope=col|Exit\n!scope=col|Destinations\n!scope=col|Notes\n|-\n|rowspan=7|Islands\n|Chek Lap Kok\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|0.0\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|Airport Road – Airport \n|Western terminus; start of Route 8 distance markers.\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Tung Chung\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|0.4\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\"|\n|\n|Start of expressway; western terminus of Route 8.\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|0.6\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdddd;\"|6C\n|style=\"background:#ffdddd;\"|Tung Chung Waterfront Road – Tung Chung (North)\n|style=\"background:#ffdddd;\"|Westbound exit and eastbound entranceFormerly numbered 6B\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|1.6\n|Tung Chung Eastern Interchange\n|style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffdddd;\"|6B\n|style=\"background:#ffdddd;\"|Yu Tung Road – Tung Chung Town Centre, Tung Chung (West)\n|style=\"background:#ffdddd;\"|Westbound exit and eastbound entranceFormerly numbered 6A\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Siu Ho Wan\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|3.4\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|6A\n|Shun Long Road – Tuen Mun, Zhuhai, Macao\n|Eastbound exit and westbound entranceLinkage to the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge and Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|4.8\n|Siu Ho Wan Interchange\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|Unnamed access road – Siu Ho Wan MTR Depot\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|5.4\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5A\n|Shun Long Road – Zhuhai, Macao\n|Westbound exit and eastbound entranceLinkage to the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Tsuen Wan\n|Yam O\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|11.3\n|Sunny Bay Interchange\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| Penny's Bay Highway – Disneyland Resort, Sunny Bay\n|\n|-\n|Tsing Chau Tsai\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|12.9\n|Lantau Toll Plaza\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n| Lantau Link – Tsing Yi, Kowloon, Hong Kong\n|Eastern terminus (at toll booths);  continues\n\nTraffic\nThe Transport Department offers traffic figures at two sections of the North Lantau Highway. The section between the western end of the highway (i.e. Airport Road) and the Tung Chung Eastern Interchange registered annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 54,410 in 2016. The section between Tung Chung and Ngong Shuen Au was busier, carrying 66,110 AADT in 2016.\n\nTraffic on the highway has increased in recent years. Some residents and legislators have raised concerns that the new Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge (see below) will increase traffic congestion.\n\nCurrent developments\nA new interchange at Tai Ho Wan is under construction. This will connect the North Lantau Expressway to the Border Crossing Facilities Island (BCF Island), a new artificial island being built as part of the controversial Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge project. The connection between the new island and the North Lantau Expressway is actually being built under the Tuen Mun–Chek Lap Kok Link project, a new road tunnel connecting Tuen Mun to the BCF Island.\n\nFrom the new interchange, a two-lane dual carriageway will run on viaducts, over the sea, to the BCF Island. The project (including the viaducts, the interchange, and modifications to the North Lantau Highway and Cheung Tung Road) is being built by Hong Kong contractor Gammon Construction for a contract value of HK$8.66 billion. The Highways Departments expects this to be complete by 2019.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nExpressways in Hong Kong\nRoute 8 (Hong Kong)\nLantau Island\nExtra areas operated by NT taxis"}

As a one-month-old with little chance of survival in the wild, she was taken by the Andalusian authority and arrived at the Jerez zoo on 17 April 2002. There she was raised together with Aura, a female of the same age born in Doñana, until both were transferred to El Acebuche Breeding Center, in the Doñana Nature Park in Huelva, on 21 February 2003.\n\nOn 28 March 2005, Saliega became the first Iberian lynx to breed in captivity, giving birth to three healthy kittens. Prior attempts at captive breeding had failed because the mothers ate their kittens immediately after birth. The father was Garfio, a three-year-old male from Sierra Morena, who was taken to El Acebuche in February 2004 for the breeding program. Two of the cubs—Brezo and Brisa—survived while the third, Brezina, died as a consequence of a fight with Brezo.\n\nOn 22 March 2008, Saliega gave birth to three more kittens at the El Acebuche captive breeding centre in the Doñana Nature Park. They were born at 64 days gestation. One of the young was rejected by the mother, and the Junta de Andalucía's Environment Department reported on 24 March 2008 that the rejected kitten had died.\n\nThe IUCN has classified the Iberian lynx as Endangered, and it is considered the world's most threatened feline species. Studies conducted in March 2005 estimated the number of surviving Iberian lynx to be as few as 100, which is down from about 400 in 2000 and down from 4,000 in 1960. If the Iberian lynx were to become extinct, it would be the first big cat species to do so since the Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago.\n\nSaliega produced a total of 16 offspring. In February 2013, she was sterilized following discovery of a mammary tumor, and her unfertilized eggs were collected and frozen. In January 2014, she retired at Zoobotánico de Jerez. She died there of natural causes in 2019.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nPrograma de Conservación Ex-Situ Official page Spanish government.\n\nIndividual felines\n2002 animal births\nIndividual animals in Spain"}

{"id": "4104171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erci%C5%9F", "title": "Erciş", "text": "Erciş (; ; , historically , Arjesh) is a municipality and district of Van Province, Turkey. Its area is 2,133 km2, and its population is 171,000 (2022). It is located at the northern end of Lake Van.\n\nHistory of Artchesh \nDuring Classical Antiquity, the town was known as Arsissa, and Archesh (Arčeš) in Armenian and Arjish in Arabic. The Byzantines knew it as Arzes (Ἂρζες or Ἀρζές) and the 10th-century emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos wrote in his De administrando imperio (Chapter XLIV) that it was under the rule of the Kaysite emirate of Manzikert. \n\nThis small district served as the capital city of a number of ruling states. It was the main center of the province of Turuberan as part of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia. The city changed hands on several occasions between the Arabs and the Byzantines, in the early Middle Ages. From the mid 1020s onwards Archesh was governed by the Byzantines. In 1054, it was captured and sacked by the Seljuk Turks commanded by Tuğrul after an eight-day siege. It was fortified in the early 14th century by the Ilkhanid vizier Ali Shah. Archesh became part of the Qara Qoyunlu state and later became a part of the Ottoman Empire. \n\nFrom 18th century, because of the increase of level of Lake Van the old town (called Archesh) slowly disappeared. By the second half of the 19th century few traces of the buildings, churches and dwelling houses remained. After old Archesh/Erciş was flooded by water, the city was moved to north to a much higher place called Alada in 1841. There the new town was built called Akants (Նոր Արճեշ (, New Artchesh in Armenian and Erciş () in Turkish). While the new site inherited the old city's name and identity, as well as most of the population, some of the old site's residents moved out into the surrounding countryside instead and settled in villages such as Çelebibaği. In 1890 64% of the population of the district was Armenian. \n\nThe Armenian population was wiped out during the Armenian genocide of 1915. That same year Russian forces captured the city during the Caucasus Campaign. They were replaced by makeshift Armenian forces after December 1917. These were eventually driven out by the Ottomans on April 1, 1918. \n\nIn July 1930 in Erçis occurred the Zilan Massacre in which the Turkish army massacred thousands of Kurds. \n\nThe city was shaken by a major earthquake on 23 October 2011.\n\nGovernment \nDistrict Governor Nuri Mehmetbeyoğlu was appointed as a trustee for the Erçis municipality.\n\nPopulation \nThe total population of the district at the end of 2022 was 171,000.\n\nGeography \nThe district covers an area of 2,133 km² and is surrounded by Muradiye District to the east, Bitlis Province to the west, Ağrı Province on the north and by Lake Van on the south. There is a volcanic mountain and caldera called  Mount Meydan in the district.\n\nTo the north of Erciş is a large, steep highland area known as the Ala Dağ (literally \"mottled mountain\"), which contains the tributaries of the Zilan Dere. This is part of a general highland belt that separates the small plains north of Lake Van from the districts of Doğubayazıt and Diyadin further north. The Mount Süphan and Mount Nemrut further west are also part of this highland belt, as is the Mount Tendürek immediately to the east. The Ala Dağ's underlying rock is fairly soft and as a result the whole area is eroded into many sharp ridges. However, many of these ridges are covered in grass. There are villages in some of the valleys in the Ala Dağ, and there was historically a route cutting through some of these valleys to reach Diyadin further north. Historical records also refer to an \"Ala Dağ\" as the site of an Ilkhanid palace and a grazing area for Mongol pastoralists, but this seems to be referring to a different place.\n\nIt is one of the most developed cities in eastern Turkey and it is the place where the folk songs are still alive. Many kinds of fruits and vegetables are raised. Planting of poplar trees is widely seen in the city and surroundings.\n\nComposition\nThere are 102 neighbourhoods in Erciş District:\n\n Adnan Menderes\n Ağaçören\n Ağırkaya\n Akbaş\n Akçayuva\n Aksakal\n Alkanat\n Apdalmezrası\n Aşağıakçagedik\n Aşağıçökek\n Aşağıgöze\n Aşağıışıklı\n Aşağıkozluca\n Bayazıt\n Bayramlı\n Bozyaka\n Bucakönü\n Bulamaç\n Çakırbey\n Camikebir\n Çatakdibi\n Çataltepe\n Çelebibağı\n Çetintaş\n Çimen\n Çobandüzü\n Çubuklu\n Deliçay\n Derekent\n Derimevi\n Dinlence\n Doğancı\n Doluca\n Duracak\n Düvenci\n Ekiciler\n Ergücü\n Evbeyli\n Gedikdibi\n Gergili\n Gökoğlan\n Gölağzı\n Görüşlü\n Gözütok\n Gültepe\n Gümüşoluk\n Hacıkaş\n Hasanabdal\n Haydarbey\n Hocaali\n İkizçalı\n İşbaşı\n Kadirasker\n Karatavuk\n Kardoğan\n Karlıyayla\n Kasımbağı\n Kayaboyun\n Kekiksırtı\n Keklikova\n Kırkdeğirmen\n Kırkpınar\n Kışla\n Kızılören\n Kocapınar\n Koçköprü\n Köycük\n Latifiye\n Mağara\n Nişancı\n Örene\n Ortayayla\n Oyalı\n Payköy\n Pınarlı\n Sabanbüken\n Sahil Kent\n Salihiye\n Salmanağa\n Şehirpazar\n Şerefli\n Söğütlü\n Taşevler\n Taşkapı\n Taşlıçay\n Tekevler\n Tekler\n Topraklı\n Ulupamir\n Uncular\n Vanyolu\n Yalındam\n Yankıtepe\n Yeşilova\n Yetişen\n Yılanlı\n Yoldere\n Yöreli\n Yukarıakçagedik\n Yukarıçınarlı\n Yukarıışıklı\n Yünören\n\nSee also\n 2011 Van earthquake\n Zilan massacre\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Erciş municipality\n Erciş district\n \n\n \nPopulated places in Van Province\nDistricts of Van Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey"}

Located on the Kapıdağ Peninsula, on the north coast of the Gulf of Erdek at the south of the Sea of Marmara, Erdek is a popular domestic holiday destination with several hotels dating back to the 1960s. The surrounding area has a rugged geology and topography with evergreen wooded areas and large olive groves. It is dominated by Mt Dindymus (782m).\n\nIn the summer ferries travel from Erdek to Avşa Adası, one of the Marmara Islands in the Sea of Marmara. The harbour overlooks tiny Zeytinlik island where there is a research station devoted to olives.\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Hittite era it was known as Artukka. Later it became a colony of Miletus. Together with other Greek cities, it took part in the Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire, but was burnt by the Persians; it seems unlikely that it was rebuilt in ancient times since Strabo does not mention it. In the Roman period it was known as Artace. After the abandonment of nearby Cyzicus, the town was re-inhabited in the early Middle Ages. In the late 7th century, it briefly hosted a Cypriot refugee population including the island's archbishop, and was known as Nova Justiniana.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period, Erdek was the centre of the Sanjak of Karasi. According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82–1893, the kaza of Erdek had a total population of 33,007, consisting of 29,165 Greeks, 3,070 Muslims, 300 Jews, 18 Armenians and 454 foreign citizens.\n\nIn the 1960s, before Bodrum and Marmaris became popular vacation spots, Erdek was a fashionable holiday resort for Istanbul residents.

It is  west of the city of Mersin.\n\nGeography\nErdemli is located between the districts of Mezitli (to the east) and Silifke (to the west). In the north, Erdemli is bordered by Karaman Province and in the south by the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe district extends from the Mediterranean coastal plain, the largest agricultural area in Mersin Province, to high in the Taurus Mountains where there is forest, and then a large area (half the land area of the district) is high mountain above the treeline.\n\nErdemli is a quiet rural district where the people are conservative, and is traditionally a stronghold of Turkish nationalist politicians; however some departments of Mersin University are opening branches here which will surely have an effect on the cultural and social life of Erdemli in the future. There is no industry except some hand-weaving of rugs so the local economy depends on agriculture. The coastal plain is covered with citrus fruits, bananas, and various fruits and vegetables grown year-round in open fields or in greenhouses. High meadows in the mountains are planted with grain pulses and fruits such as apples, peaches, and cherries. At these altitudes there are also vineyards, olive groves, and fig trees.\n\nThis is an attractive forested coastal district, and Erdemli is now attracting investment in infrastructure to develop a tourist industry.\n\nThe coast is home to the endangered Mediterranean monk seal.

Its area is 2,214 km2, and its population is 150,978 (2022). Its elevation is .\n\nHistory\nThe ancient town of Heraclea Cybistra (Ηράκλεια Κυβίστρα in Ancient Greek) was located here, and gave its name (Heracles) to the modern town. The town had some importance in Hellenistic times owing to its position near the point where the road to the Gülek Pass (Cilician Gates) enters the hills. It lay in the way of armies and was more than once sacked by the Arab invaders of Asia Minor (AD 805 and 832). During the Crusade of 1101 it was the scene of a failed battle of 15,000 men led by William II, Count of Nevers against the Seljuks, which left the Crusaders weak en route to Antioch. It became Turkish (Seljuk) in the 11th century. \n\nEreğli is also known for being the first capital of the Karaman Beylik founded by Nur Sufi Bey.  The Karaman state was renowned for being a consistent nuisance to Ottoman dominance in Anatolia, being one of the few Anatolian beyliks to retain sovereignty well past Mehmed the Conqueror's conquest of Constantinople.  It was also the first political entity and beylik in Anatolia to proclaim Turkish as an official language alongside Arabic and Persian. In 1553, upon return from a campaign in Persia, Suleiman the Magnificent had his son, Şehzade Mustafa, killed in the Ereğli valley where the Ottoman Army was stationed. Modern Ereğli had grown from a large village to a town since the railway reached it from Konya and Karaman in 1904; and it has now hotels and thriving businesses.\n\nArchaeology \n\nThree hours’ ride south is the famous \"Hittite\" rock relief of a lynx, representing a king (probably of neighbouring Tyana) adoring a god. This was the first \"Hittite\" monument discovered in modern times (early 18th century, by the Swede Otter, an emissary of Louis XIV).\n\nEreğli may be the location of the Hittite town of Hupisna (Ḫupišna), where the goddess Ḫuwaššanna was worshipped. She was linked with Gazbaba, a Mesopotamian love goddess also connected with Inanna.\n\nIn the early Iron Age, Hupisna also was a neo-Hittite polity in the land of Tabal. Two kings of Hupisna are known from the Assyrian sources: Puḫamme (c. 837 BC) and Urimme (c. 738 BC).\n\nComposition\nThere are 87 neighbourhoods in Ereğli District:\n\n 500 Evler\n Acıkuyu\n Acıpınar\n Adabağ\n Akhüyük\n Alhan\n Alpaslan\n Aşağıgöndelen\n Aşıklar\n Atakent\n Aydınlar\n Aziziye\n Bahçeli\n Barbaros\n Batıalagözü\n Belceağaç\n Belkaya\n Beyköy\n Beyören\n Boyacıali\n Bulgurluk\n Burhaniye\n Büyükdede\n Cahı\n Çakmak\n Camikebir\n Çayhan\n Çiller\n Çimencik\n Cinler\n Çömlekçi\n Dalmaz\n Doğualagözlü\n Eti\n Fatih\n Gaybi\n Gökçeyazı\n Göktöme\n Gülbahçe\n Hacımemiş\n Hacımustafa\n Hacımutahir\n Hamidiye\n Hıdırlı\n Hortu\n Kamışlıkuyu\n Karaburun\n Kargacı\n Kazancı\n Kızılgedik\n Kuskuncuk\n Kutören\n Kuzukuyu\n Mehmet Akif\n Mellicek\n Mimar Sinan\n Namık Kemal\n Orhangazi\n Orhaniye\n Özgürler\n Pınarözü\n Pirömer\n Sarıca\n Sarıtopallı\n Selçuklu\n Servili\n Şinasi\n Sümer\n Talatpaşa\n Taşağıl\n Taşbudak\n Tatlıkuyu\n Toros\n Türbe\n Türkmen\n Üçgöz\n Ulumeşe\n Yazlık\n Yellice\n Yenibağlar\n Yeniköy\n Yıldırımbeyazıt\n Yıldızlı\n Yukarıgöndelen\n Yunuslu\n Zengen\n Ziya Gökalp\n\nTransportation\n\nEreğli Gar is the railway station of the town.

{"id": "4104203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm%20King", "title": "Rhythm King", "text": "Rhythm King Records Ltd was a British independent record label, founded in the mid-1980s by Martin Heath, Adele Nozedar, DJ Jay Strongman and James Horrocks. It was based in Chiswick, London.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginnings\nStarting out as an offshoot of Daniel Miller's critically acclaimed Mute Records, Rhythm King's initial focus was dance music - specifically house, acid house, acid jazz, sampling culture and hip hop/rap. Strongman's rap/funk offshoot, Flame Records, signed proto-gangsta rapper Schoolly D and Chuck Brown & the Soul Searchers amongst others. James Horrocks left the label at the end of 1987, and subsequently went on to form React Music Limited in 1990, which also had a focus upon dance music. This left Martin Heath in sole charge of the label; however by the beginning of 1988, Rhythm King was to enjoy a period of short term success, which went hand in hand with the partial dominance dance music had on the UK Singles Chart, from the late 1980s to the beginning of the 2000s.\n\nJanuary 1988 - First UK Singles Chart breakthrough - The Beatmasters / Bomb the Bass\nThe breakthrough was the single \"Rok da House\" by The Beatmasters featuring The Cookie Crew. Initially reaching No. 78 when first released in July 1987, the single was re-released in January 1988 and reached No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1988.  It is acknowledged as not only one of the earliest British house tunes (recorded 1986), but also as the first record to merge hip-hop and house, into a style known as hip house. This was followed up by \"Beat Dis\" by Bomb The Bass. The identity of Bomb The Bass was shrouded in mystery until it was revealed that it was the work of London's Wag Club DJ Tim Simenon, and record producer Pascal Gabriel. Simenon brought his DJ experience, record collection and techniques gained from a music production course to create a cut and paste style which, with Gabriel's help, successfully merged sounds and samples from various genres within dance music.  These included old school hip hop, house, electro and funk with samples from film and TV - most notably The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Thunderbirds. The record reputedly cost £500 to make and debuted at No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1988 - what was then the highest debut position for an unknown artist. It eventually reached No. 2 for two weeks and was kept off the top spot by Kylie Minogue's debut single \"I Should Be So Lucky\".\n\nTheme From S-Express and further hits\nRhythm King did not have to wait too long for its first UK Singles Chart No. 1. S-Express was the brainchild of London DJ Mark Moore who ,in collaboration with producer Pascal Gabriel (also in Bomb the Bass), put together the single, \"Theme from S'Express\". This mixed many of the contemporary dance music sounds of the time with a sample from Rose Royce's 1970s disco anthem \"Is It Love You're After\" to great success. Vocalist, David White aka Steam supplied vocals for the US release of the single. The single shot to No .1 in April/May 1988 and 1988 to 1991 would be a golden period for Rhythm King with its artists - in particular The Beatmasters, Betty Boo, Bomb The Bass, Merlin and S-Express doing well in the UK Album and Singles Charts.\n\nOuter Rhythm and Renegade Software\nWith rave culture going mainstream from the late 1980s, Rhythm King also became interested in this and formed Outer Rhythm in 1989. The emphasis at Outer Rhythm was electronic dance music/techno and was influential in developing the initial music careers of Leftfield and, to a much lesser degree, Moby. Briefly Outer Rhythm was also associated with Sheffield's Warp Records - and the Yorkshire Bleeps and Bass scene which launched Warp, along with Belgium based R&S Records before the labels and their artists - including Aphex Twin, CJ Bolland, Dave Angel, Jam & Spoon, LFO and Nightmares on Wax went on to do big things in their own right. Martin Heath also diversified into computer games software in association with the Bitmap Brothers. Renegade Software was successful and some of Rhythm King's artists - including The Beatmasters, Betty Boo, Bomb The Bass and Nation 12 contributed music to some of Renegade's titles.\n\nDeal with Sony Records\nThe commercial success of Rhythm King enabled it to link a distribution deal with Sony Records subsidiary Epic Records. Rhythm King was no longer associated with Mute Records from 1991 and towards the end of 1992 it closed down the Outer Rhythm offshoot. Coincidentally, Mute set up Novamute Records around this time - also with a focus on techno and electronic dance music.\n\nDirection of Rhythm King in the 1990s\nAs the 1990s progressed, many of the established artists on Rhythm King's roster - including Baby Ford, The Beatmasters, Betty Boo, Bomb The Bass, Leftfield, Moby and S-Express either left the label and/or concentrated on producing for other artists - most notably Tim Simenon and The Beatmasters, the latter in particular immediately achieving success with their work on a string of singles taken from the 1992 Shamen album, Boss Drum.  The musical focus at Rhythm King in the mid 1990s shifted away from dance music and more towards indie and alternative rock. Acts signed during this period had varying levels of critical and commercial success, and included David Devant and his Spirit Wife, The Dharmas, Echobelly, Sheep on Drugs, The Sultans Of Ping and X-CNN.\n\nEnter Arista exit Rhythm King\nRhythm King's distribution deal with Sony Records expired around 1995/96 so a new deal with BMG's Arista Records was signed in 1996. Rhythm King was subsequently closed down and merged into the main Arista concern when Martin Heath became head of the label.  However, this was not the end of Heath's involvement with an independent record label. Lizard King Records was formed by Heath and Dominic Hardisty in 2001, and its most notable artist was US act The Killers, who were signed to Lizard King in the UK and Ireland. In 2005, Hardisty bought out Heath and Heath moved to New York to set up a new label.  As part of the deal he was permitted to re-use the name Lizard King, but the Killers remain signed to the original company which has now been renamed Marrakesh Records.\n\nArtists\nRhythm King had a varied roster of artists. Some of these had only a short-term relationship with the label and others had more of a longer term relationship releasing a number of singles and albums to varying degrees of commercial and critical success. The artist roster for the label therefore included the following:\n\n Ability 2 - Released on the Outer Rhythm offshoot.\n Aphex Twin - The releases Digeridoo and Selected Ambient Works 85-92 were released by Belgium-based R&S Records who had a distribution deal with Outer Rhythm for UK releases from 1990-92.\n Baby Ford - The third Baby Ford album BFORD9 was released on Rhythm King's offshoot label Transglobal.

Because of the historical significance of some of the officials that Chopin was commissioned to photograph, a number of his portraits have been preserved, including portraits of Sir Frederick Barlee, Sir Malcolm Fraser and Sir Luke Leake. During the 1870s the photography market became very competitive, and Chopin began to tour country districts in search of custom.

{"id": "4104216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geological%20Museum", "title": "Geological Museum", "text": "The Geological Museum (originally the Museum of Economic Geology then the Museum of Practical Geology), started in 1835 as one of the oldest single science museums in the world and now part of the Natural History Museum in London. It transferred from Jermyn Street to Exhibition Road, South Kensington in 1935 in a building designed by Sir Richard Allison and John Hatton Markham of the Office of Works.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Museum of Practical Geology was established in 1837 in a building at 6 Craig's Court, Whitehall, at the suggestion of Henry de la Beche, the first director general of the Geological Survey. The museum's library was founded by de la Beche in 1843, mainly by donation from his own library. Initially under the Ordnance Survey, the museum administration moved to the Department of Woods and Forests in 1845.\n\nJermyn Street\nLarger premises soon became necessary, and a design for a new building was commissioned from James Pennethorne. This, built on a long narrow site with frontages in Piccadilly and Jermyn Street, housed the galleries, as well as a library, a 500-seat lecture theatre, offices and laboratories. It was constructed between 1845 and 1849, and was opened by Prince Albert on May 14, 1851.\n\nThe purpose of the museum, as summarised in the Descriptive Guide, published in 1867, was:\n\nto exhibit the rocks minerals, and organic remains, illustrating the maps and sections of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom: also to exemplify the applications of the Mineral productions of these Islands to the uses of purposes of use and ornament\n\nThe collections were accordingly arranged in two main sections covering natural materials found in the United Kingdom, and industrial products made from them. There were three secondary sections, covering mechanical appliances used to process raw materials, specimens of historical products, and foreign materials imported in their raw state. The museum also included maps, mosaics, glass, pottery, and busts of prominent geologists and scientists, including William Smith and James Hall.\n\nIn the summer of 1933, the Geological Museum, still at its old location, was the focus of worldwide attention when it served as the venue of the London Economic Conference, bringing together the representatives of 66 nations in a failed effort to end the then-prevalent global depression.\n\nExhibition Road\nThe museum was reopened by the then Duke of York in July 1935, after the completion of the new building on Exhibition Road in South Kensington two years prior - it had housed the ill-starred World Economic Conference in June 1933. The cost of the new building was stated at around £220,000 by the First Commissioner of Works.  Following the move, the museum became well known for the many dioramas (three-dimensional paintings) used to interpret geology and one or two mining techniques. These have largely been dismantled since the Natural History Museum took over the museum in 1986.\n\nIn 1965, the museum was merged with the British Geological Survey and Overseas Geological Surveys, under the name \"Institute of Geological Sciences\". In 1971 the museum employed the late designer James Gardner to design and produce The Story of the Earth, which was acknowledged as a significant breakthrough in science museum design and critically acclaimed and imitated worldwide. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and became well known for the huge reproduction of a rock face, cast from site in Scotland, and for its planetarium, active volcano model and earthquake machine.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974 the museum formed its own design team which, working closely with the scientists and technicians, produced a series of temporary and permanent exhibitions starting with the re-presentation of the gem collection and then, with a design team led by Giles Velarde (Head of Exhibition Design from 1974 to 1988), produced Early Days of Geology in Britain, Black Gold, Britain Before Man, Journey to the Planets, British Fossils, Pebbles, Treasures of the Earth and finally British Offshore Oil and Gas, which opened in 1988.\n\nTreasures of the Earth was the first major museum gallery in the world to integrate computers presenting images and text adjacent to artefacts as part of the information process within the exhibition. The central feature film, Liquid Assets, in the Oil and Gas exhibition was shot and viewed vertically from a circular gallery and won a major award from the IVCA in 1989.\n\n\"The Power Within\" exhibition on seismology includes a reconstruction of the 1995 Kobe earthquake.\n\nTransfer to the Natural History Museum\nFollowing the relocation of the British Geological Survey's academic activities to Keyworth, the museum was transferred from the custody of the Natural Environment Research Council to the newly independent Natural History Museum. Although an administrative merger with the Natural History Museum had been effected by 1985 (from which time the former Geological Museum was promoted as The Earth Galleries), it was not until 1998 that the previously difficult to find corridor between the two museum buildings was replaced by a new link gallery.  The former Geological Museum galleries are now known as the Red Zone in the Natural History Museum's plans and internal directional signage.\n\nVisions of Earth\n\nSurveys had shown that relatively few visitors navigated the Geological Museum's monumental staircase to the top floors. A major re-ordering of the galleries means that visitors are now encouraged to start their visit at the top of the building by ascending an escalator as part of the visit itinerary.\n\nThe former Central Hall of the museum, renamed as Visions of Earth, was transformed in 1996 to a design by Neal Potter. This included the installation of a large escalator (rising eleven metres at a 30° slope) that ascends continuously over two storeys and passes through a model globe. The previously open-sided balconies of the atrium space are now solid walls lined with slabs of recycled slate. These are sand-blasted to show the major stars in the night sky and the planets in the Solar System. When first opened, the globe rotated around the escalator, with dramatic sound effects based on Jimi Hendrix's \"Third Stone from the Sun\", attempting to give an impression of the flux in the core of the Earth.\n\nThe Museums Association's journal Museum Practice reported in 2007 that \"the contrast between galleries just before and just after Potter’s arrival (at the Natural History Museum) is like switching over from a television programme made for schools to a big-screen epic, choreographed by Busby Berkeley.\"\n\nIn 2014 the displays in the centre of the atrium were removed and replaced by an original skeleton of a stegosaurus on open display, and in 2015 a new human evolution gallery was opened\n\nSee also \n Museum Lane to the north\n Simpsons of Piccadilly\n\nReferences \n\n \n\nMuseums established in 1835\nMuseums disestablished in 1988\nNatural history museums in England\nGeology museums in England\nNatural History Museum, London\nMuseums in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea\nDefunct museums in London\n1835 establishments in England\n1988 disestablishments in England"}
{"id": "4104220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNER%20locomotive%20numbering%20and%20classification", "title": "LNER locomotive numbering and classification", "text": "A number of different numbering and classification schemes were used for the locomotives owned by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and its constituent companies. This page explains the principal systems that were used. The following abbreviations for the constituent companies are used on this page:\n\n Principal Constituents\n\nGreat Central Railway (GCR), Great Eastern Railway (GER), Great Northern Railway (GNR), Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR), Hull and Barnsley Railway (HBR), North British Railway (NBR), and North Eastern Railway (NER)\n\n Minor Companies (absorbed between July 1923 and July 1924)\n\nColne Valley and Halstead Railway (CV&HR), East and West Yorkshire Union Railway (E&WYUR), and Mid-Suffolk Light Railway (MSLR)\n\n Later Additions\n\nMidland and Great Northern Joint Railway (M&GNJR) - absorbed October 1936\n\nEx-Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives (via the London Passenger Transport Board) - absorbed November 1937\n\n For information about individual classes and locomotives, see: Locomotives of the London and North Eastern Railway\n\nNumbering\n\nConstituent Companies\nThe constituent companies of the LNER operated no specific numbering system. Locomotives were numbered in a range starting from 1, with new locomotives being given numbers according to one of three different ways:\n New numbers at the end of the existing series;\n 'Significant numbers' (e.g. the first of the GER's new passenger locomotive class built from 1900 was numbered '1900', leaving many preceding numbers unused); or\n Filling in blanks left by the withdrawal of older locomotives, or their transfer to the 'duplicate list' (see below).\n\nIn the latter case, on the GER at least, some attempt was made to keep locomotives of the same class numbered in sequence. The GCR and GNoSR operated a strict policy of not permitting any gaps in the number series, nominally for accounting purposes, but this was not followed on other lines.\n\nIn 1922, the first step towards the 'Grouping' was taken, when the HBR was absorbed by the NER. At that time 3000 was added to the numbers of surviving HBR locomotives which left them well clear of the highest NER numbers then allocated (about 2350).\n\nIn almost all cases, the constituent companies used only steam locomotives. The NER had 13 electric lomotives, numbered 1-13, but this was in fact in the company's main locomotive list as the lowest-numbered steam locomotive was numbered 14. The NBR owned a petrol shunter, and this was numbered '1' in its own series.\n\nDuplicate Lists\n'Duplicate lists' were operated by most of the constituent companies in which older locomotives, whose capital costs had been written off but which were not yet ready for withdrawal, could be renumbered, releasing space in the main number range for new locomotives. A variety of different approaches to creating a duplicate list were employed:\n\n GCR: 'B' suffix added\n GER: '0' prefix added\n GNR: 'A' suffix added\n GNoSR: 'A' suffix added\n NBR: 1000 added to original number\n NER: Use of duplicate list abandoned before Grouping\n\nPost-Grouping Numbering\nWhen the LNER was created in 1923, it immediately set about finding a solution to the problem that many of its inherited locomotives carried the same numbers. The first solution, applied from September 1923 was to add a letter suffix to numbers that indicated the original owning company. The first column of the table below shows the letters applied in bold followed by an explanation of the letter in lighter type.\n\nThis solution was quickly abandoned as it meant that ex-NBR locomotives were carrying numbers that duplicated ex-GCR locomotives carried in their duplicate list. Indeed, this system would not have coped well with any of the locomotives in the constituent company's duplicate lists. Therefore, a new system was derived and applied from February 1924. This involved adding a multiple of thousands to each locomotive number, except:\n Ex-NER locomotives which retained their original number;\n Ex-HBR and ex-GCR duplicate list locomotives which were completely renumbered.\n\nOther duplicate list locomotives were renumbered in the same manner as those in the capital list; i.e. with the prescribed multiple of thousands added, but retaining their prefix or suffix as appropriate. Departmental (non-revenue earning) locomotives continued to be numbered in their own, locally-applied, series.\n\nThe table below sets out the number ranges used for this system:\n\nNote: At first, it was planned to renumber the ex-NBR duplicate list locomotives into blank numbers in the main ex-NBR series. This would have left the highest number allocated as 10050, but after only a handful of locomotives had been so treated, the scheme was abandoned and all duplicate list locomotives were renumbered with 9000 added to their original numbers.\n\nMinor Companies \nThe LNER also absorbed locomotives from a number of smaller railway companies. Their locomotive stock were renumbered as follows:\n Ex-CV&HR and MSLR: Being located in the ex-GER area, these locomotives took numbers 8312-8317, which were blank numbers in the GER series.\n Ex-E&WYUR: Being located in the ex-GNR area, these locomotives took numbers 3112-3115, which were blank numbers in the GNR series\n Ex-M&GNJR: These locomotives had a '0' added as a prefix to their numbers.\n Ex-Metropolitan Railway: Being located in the ex-GCR operating area, these locomotives took numbers 6154-6163 and 6415-6422 in the GCR series.\n\nNew Locomotives \nImmediately after Grouping, new engines were numbered in the series used by their constituent company that had ordered them; including the onward transfer of older locomotives to the appropriate duplicate list. Subsequently the new numbering systems of 1923 and 1924 were used in the same way.\n\nThereafter, new locomotives built to LNER designs were mostly numbered in blocks of unused numbers, keeping engines of the same class together. In general, the lowest available block of numbers were used (i.e. starting with the 2xxx numbers after the ex-HBR stock and moving upwards), but there were some exceptions:\n Some engines built for work in a specific area took numbers in the range used for engines of the appropriate constituent company.\n Some engines were given 'significant numbers' for publicity purposes, e.g. the experimental water tube boiler locomotive was allocated 10000, and the 'P2' class started at 2001.\n\nThere is evidence that there were cases where new engines were initially allocated numbers in one series according to one of the principles set out above, but these were changed before the engines were released into service in line with an alternative principle. For example, 'P2' class 2001 was originally allocated '2981' until it was decided to give it a 'significant number' instead.\n\n1942 Renumbering\nIn October 1942, a limited renumbering of locomotives was undertaken to clear numbers in the 8300-8900 series for reuse by new locomotives. The following locomotives were affected:\n\nHowever, this scheme was abandoned in early 1943, after only 38 locomotives had been renumbered. The reason was that new plans had been drawn up to carry out a wholesale renumbering of engines, as set out below. The engines that had been renumbered mostly continued to carry their 1942 numbers until the 1946 renumbering was implemented, though two reverted to their 1923 numbers to make way for new locomotive construction.\n\n1944 Interim Renumbering\nIn the interim period between the new numbering system being devised (See below) and it being applied to engines from 1946, a number of temporary renumberings were undertaken to keep things in order. These included:\n 3157-3167 (10 survivors only) renumbered 3180-3189 to make way for new freight engines.\n 4075 renumbered  to the 'significant number' of 2000 following its refurbishment for dedicated use hauling officers' saloons (resulting in old 2000 becoming 2050). This engine was briefly numbered 1 after refurbishment, during which time old 1 became 4075 before reverting to 1.\n 8000-8011 renumbered 7978-7989 to make way for new diesel shunters.\n\n1946 Renumbering\nThe downside of the numbering system used by the LNER - and which had not been tackled by the 1942 renumbering - was that locomotives were carrying scattered numbers without reference to class, let alone type of locomotive. In 1943, a scheme was drawn up that would see a complete renumbering of the LNER stock, so that locomotives of the same class would be numbered together and placed in a series with classes of the same type. Only three locomotives would retain their previous numbers: one (Class W1 no. 10000) by design, the other two (Class J3 nos. 4125/6) by coincidence. Due to the pressures of World War II, the scheme was not actually implemented until 1946, but the basic principles remained the same, as set out in the table below:\n\nIn each class, individual engines were numbered in order of construction (with a small number of exceptions, most notably the 'A4' class where locomotives carrying the names of the LNER's directors were given 'significant numbers' 1-4).\n\nSelf-evidently the renumbering process was very complicated as the LNER was keen not to have two locomotives running in service with the same number. This meant renumbering engines whose new numbers were already vacant first and then following through the chain of renumberings.\n\nThere was a further complication in that part-way through the renumbering, there was a change of plan in terms of the numbers allocated in the 1-999 series (for reasons that are mostly unclear), the 1xxx series (to allow more space for new 'B1' class engines), and the 3xxx series (to allow more space for engines purchased from the War Department). This meant some of these engines were renumbered twice (106 in total - 59 of which were 'O1' or 'O4' engines). The changes were as follows:\n\nIn addition, there were a number of other minor changes from the original plan where engines had since been withdrawn, but in these cases the numbers allocated under the new plan were carried from the start and no additional renumbering was required.\n\nApplication by British Railways\nNew engines built by British Railways to ex-LNER designs after Nationalisation in 1948 continued to use this numbering system, albeit with 60000 added to the numbers to avoid number conflicts with other absorbed engines (see BR locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification). There were some minor amendments made by BR, however:\n\n Former LNER diesel and petrol shunters were numbered in the 15xxx series (though the petrol shunters initially carried their appropriate 68xxx series numbers until 1949), while the electric locomotives were numbered in the 26xxx series, leaving the 66xxx series unused.\n LNER 10000 became 60700 as the 70xxx series was designated for standard BR steam designs\n Ex-War Department freight locomotives, initially allocated their appropriate 6xxxx series numbers, were renumbered into the 90xxx series along with other engines of this type purchased by BR.\n 'L1' class engines, initially numbered from 9000 upwards by the LNER and 69000 upwards by BR, were quickly renumbered to 67701 upwards, where there was more space for new engine numbers. The 69000 series was then reused for new-build 'J72' locomotives.\n\nIn addition, older engines continued to be renumbered within the rules of the LNER numbering system to make way for new engines, particular production of the 'B1' and 'K1' classes.\n\nClassification\n\nConstituent Companies\n\nGreat Central Railway\nFrom 1859, the GCR identified different classes using an alphanumeric system. The first list of classes was a simple list of numbers from 1 onward. Number 18 was the highest allocated. Thence, newly built classes received class numbers with a letter suffix rather than using more numbers. By 1923, the '9' series (the largest) had reached '9Q'. Of themselves the letters and numbers had no meaning; they appear to have been allocated randomly.\n\nWhere new classes were built, or existing classes rebuilt, these were often indicated by adding a more meaningful suffix to the existing alphanumeric class were used. Examples included:\n  ALT: Altered\n    B: Bogie version\n CONV: Converted\n    I: Improved version\n    M: Motor train equipment fitted\n    T: Tank engine version\n\nLocomotives inherited from the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway retained their existing classifications (lettered A to D) and the locomotive inherited from the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway was left unclassified.\n\nGreat Eastern Railway\nThe principal GER works at Stratford used an order number series that ran from A to Z, then A1 to Z1, A2 to Z2 and so on. This system was used for a myriad of items, including locomotives, but it was these numbers that were used to refer to locomotive classes. Self-evidently this meant there was no continuity in the GER locomotive classification system. The highest-numbered locomotive class was 'H88'.\n\nWhere more than one order number had been used for a given class, the first order number allocated was used to refer to the whole class. Where locomotives were purchased from outside manufacturers, they were referred to by the lowest number applied to a class member.\n\nGreat Northern Railway\nFrom 1900, the GNR adopted a system of classification based on a locomotive's wheel arrangemenent (using the Whyte Notation), with each arrangement being represented by a letter. Initially, the letters A to J were allocated in ascending order of driving axles and descending order of leading axles. Letters K to O were allocated later as new types were introduced and A was re-used once all the 4-2-2 locomotives had been withdrawn. The full list of letters used was as follows:\n\nAfter the letter was a number that identified broadly similar types, although there could be some significant variation within a single class number. In the main, numbers were allocated in descending order of driving wheel diameter.\n\nGreat North of Scotland Railway\nIn 1879, every class then in service was allocated a letter between 'A' and 'M' (except 'I'), the oldest types first. From then on, new classes either reused letters that had become free due to withdrawal of older engines, or were allocated a letter at the end of the series. Class 'U' was not used and the highest letter allocated was 'Y'.\n\nHull and Barnsley Railway\nClasses were allocated a letter consecutively from 'A', with similar classes being allocated a numeric suffix, or an 'S' suffix to indicate Superheated. The last class letter allocated was 'L'. When the HBR was absorbed by the NER from April 1922, the suffix '(HB)' was added to all ex-HBR classes to differentiate them from NER classes.\n\nNorth British Railway\nIn 1913, every locomotive then in service was allocated a letter indicating its power. Letters 'A' to 'G' were used for goods engines and shunters and 'H' to 'R' for passenger engines, most powerful types first. Letters 'O' and 'Q' were not used. This system did mean that each letter covered a variety of different classes of locomotive.\n\nNorth Eastern Railway\nPrior to 1886, classes were referred to by the number applied to the first built locomotive within that class. New classes built after 1886 were allocated a letter to describe them, commencing at A. Where new classes were a modification of an earlier class allocated a letter, then they were allocated that letter with a numeric suffix starting at 1. The series reached Z in 1911. The next new class was allocated 'D', which had become vacant following rebuilding of the original class to take that letter. \n\nThere were some exceptions to this system:\n Class BTP: A series of Bogie Tank Passenger locomotives built in 1874.\n Class 3CC and 4CC: A series of 3- and 4-Cylinder Compound locomotives.\n Class 4-6-2: The five 4-6-2 locomotives built in 1922.\n\nMinor Companies\nThe three minor companies absorbed by the LNER in 1923 and 1924 were too small to need to classify their locomotive stock. However, both the M&GNJR and Metropolitan Railway had owned a much larger stock of locomotives. Both railways allocated each class a letter consecutively from 'A'. The highest letter issued by the M&GNJR was 'D', and by the Metropolitan was 'K'.\n\nLNER System\n\nSteam Locomotives\nWhen the LNER was created in 1923, a new classification scheme was drawn up that could accommodate all the inherited steam locomotives and future new classes, and provide useful information about the features of a given class. The answer, approved in September 1923, was a variation of the GNR system, using a letter to indicate each type's wheel arrangement (based on the Whyte Notation). \n\nThe letters were allocated with passenger engine arrangements first in descending order of coupled wheels ('A' to 'H'), then goods engine arrangements in ascending order of coupled wheels ('J' to 'T'). Letters 'X' to 'Z' were used for a variety of small engine arrangements. Letters 'I' and 'U' to 'W' were left unused at the time, but the latter three were later applied when new wheel arrangements were introduced; I was never used. The full list of letters used was as follows:\n\nThe letter 'Z' was initially intended for all miscellaneous classes, including departmental (non-revenue earning types), no matter what their wheel arrangement. However, this application was abandoned in 1927 and the letter was used solely for 0-4-2 types from then onwards.\n\nAfter the letter was a number, which was unique to a particular class of locomotive. In 1923, these numbers were allocated (with a small number of exceptions) in the following order:\n Tender engines first, then tank engines (except letters 'X' and 'Y')\n Ex-GNR classes first, then ex-GCR, GER, NER (including HBR), NBR and GNoSR classes\n In order of driving wheel diameter, largest first\n In order of age, oldest first\n\nIn order to indicate variations within a class, subclass numbers were issued, taking the form of a suffix to the main class number, e.g. 'D17/1'. \n\nNew build and converted locomotives to LNER designs were allocated class numbers in appropriate gaps in the series. On occasions, this led to the re-use of class numbers left vacant following withdrawal or rebuilding of its members. This occurred only infrequently up to 1941, but became more common thereafter. Indeed, on occasions, older classes in the course of withdrawal were reclassified so that new types could have lower numbers; e.g. the old 'B1' class became 'B18' to make room for the new standard LNER 4-6-0 type.\n\nDuring 1942, three new types were allocated the appropriate letter classification ('A', 'B' and 'D') but without any suffix number; these were prototypes for what were planned to be the new standard LNER classes. However, this approach was not maintained, and the production types were allocated standard class numbers.\n\nA number of classes inherited by the LNER were not formally allocated a place in the new system. Most of these were one-off or departmental engines, or types slated for early withdrawal, although some of the latter survived in stock through to 1928. However, there were some curious gaps in the formal list of class numbers allocated in 1923, and it may be that some of these unused numbers were nominally intended for these classes. Other gaps in the list were clearly left to allow space for the construction of new classes, and many of these gaps were filled in due course.\n\nEngines absorbed from the smaller companies during 1923-1924 (the CV&HR, E&WYUR and MSLR) were either withdrawn before a classification could be allocated or were fitted into appropriate gaps in the class list. For the ex-M&GNJR engines (absorbed 1936), their original single letter classification was maintained through to 1942 when they were, at last, allocated class numbers at the end of the appropriate series. The only exceptions were engines that were identical to ex-GNR designs, which adopted the latter's classification. In contrast, the ex-Metropolitan Railway engines (absorbed 1937) were allocated LNER classifications immediately.\n\nModern Traction \nDiesel and electric locomotives were given three-part classifications, commencing with either 'DE' for Diesel (electric transmission), 'DM' for Diesel (mechanical transmission)  or 'E' for Electric, then 'B' for Banking, 'E' for Express, 'M' for Mixed Traffic or 'S' for Shunter, and finally a number issued to different types consecutively from 1.\n\nNote: The LNER's petrol shunters were initially unclassified. When they were allocated a class number in the 1940s, it was 'Y11' in the steam locomotive class series. Similarly, the diesel electric shunters were initially allocated 'J45', being reclassified 'DES1' from September 1945.\n\nReferences\n\nLondon and North Eastern Railway\nLocomotive classification systems"}

Its area is 273 km2, and its population is 614,891 (2022). It mainly consists of large public housing projects,  from Ankara city centre. Its elevation is .\n\nHistory\nArchaeological research shows habitation since 2000 BC, including a Phrygian settlement in the 8th century BC. Then of course the district began to share the history of the city of Ankara with its Lydians, Persians, Galatians, Ancient Romans, Byzantines and finally Turks. Etimesgut is on the ancient Silk Road to the orient, and still today the road and railway from Ankara to Istanbul pass through the district.\n\nAtatürk was fond of the area and would come here to ride horses and chat to the locals. He had a room in the building that is the public health laboratory today, and many other public buildings, including the hospital and the post office, that were built by his order still stand today.\n\nEtimesgut began as a housing project of 50 homes ordered by Atatürk in 1924 to accommodate Turkish refugees from Bulgaria. From the 1950s, as poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city much illegal housing gecekondu was thrown up in this district. Some of this has been replaced by public housing projects such as Elvankent, Eryaman and Güzelkent and also military and civil service accommodation. However much gecekondu remains, inhabited by working-class people from cities such as Erzurum, many of whom commute to jobs in the city of Ankara.\nThe Islamic terrorist organisation Hizbullah had a number of hidden cells here in the 1990s.\n\nPresent\nThe area has only the most basic shops and amenities.  Almost all of the housing in Etimesgut is apartment buildings except for the Güzelkent project. As building land in the city of Ankara is now impossible to find, areas like this on the fringes of the city, where building land is cheap, are growing faster and faster.\n\nPublic buildings include the sugar factory, the Turkish aviation authority headquarters at Etimesgut Airport and a military training camp.\n\nAs for places to shop, Etimesgut has a myriad of shopping malls, with one of the latest of them constructed being also one of the biggest and most popular: Metromall AVM. The building is made up of 5 floors, 2 of them being basement floors, and the second basement being a closed car park. The construction of the shopping mall started in 2014 in Eryaman, Etimesgut, and it finished construction officially in 2017. Both the design and the construction of the building was done by \"MSA Mimarlık\", an architecture company based in Ankara. Today, the shopping mall is one of the most popular shopping malls in Etimesgut, and increased the property value and overall popularity of Eryaman since its construction.\n\nThe local football team Etimesgut Şekerspor has a chequered history; in recent years it has gained popularity by hiring former national team player Sergen Yalçın.\n\nDemographics\n\nPlanned security campus\nThe construction of a new building in Etimesgut is underway, to serve as the joint new headquarters of the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MİT), the Ministry of National Defence, and the Turkish General Staff together with the commands of the Army, Navy and Air Force branches of the Turkish Armed Forces. Reportedly, the move, which will turn the area into a \"security campus\" comparable to the US Pentagon, is part of measures taken after the failed 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt.\n\nComposition\nThere are 38 neighbourhoods in Etimesgut District:\n\n 30 Ağustos\n Ahi Mesut\n Alsancak\n Altay\n Aşağıyurtçu\n Atakent\n Atayurt\n Ayyıldız\n Bağlıca\n Bahçekapı\n Balıkuyumcu\n Devlet\n Elvan\n Erler\n Eryaman\n Etiler\n Fatih Sultan\n Fevziye\n Göksu\n Güzelkent\n İstasyon\n Kazım Karabekir\n Oğuzlar\n Orhun\n Piyade\n Şehit Osman Avcı\n Şehitali\n Şeker\n Şeyh Şamil\n Süvari\n Topçu\n Tunahan\n Turkuaz\n Yapracık\n Yavuz Selim\n Yeni Bağlıca\n Yeşilova\n Yukarıyurtçu\n\nFormer broadcasting site\nAt Etimesgut, there was a longwave broadcasting station with two masts each 256 metres tall, which worked on 198 kHz.

As a holder of a royal warrant, he used the title \"Cartographer to the King\"; for this reason he was sometimes known by the epithet \"the Prince of Cartography\".\n\nBartholomew's longest lasting legacy is arguably naming the continent of Antarctica, which until his use of the term in 1890 had been largely ignored due to its lack of resources and harsh climate.\n\nBiography\nBartholomew came from a celebrated line of map-makers. He was the son of Annie McGregor (d. 1872) and John Bartholomew Junior, and the grandson of the founder of John Bartholomew and Son Ltd. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh and the University of Edinburgh.\n\nUnder his administration the family business became one of the top operations in its field. Bartholomew himself was not merely a specialist in production, but also a talented geographer and cartographer. It was he who introduced the use of coloured contour layer maps; he also anticipated the needs of late nineteenth and early 20th century travellers by publishing street maps of major cities, cycling maps, railway timetable maps, and road maps for automobiles.\n\nHe collaborated with major scientific figures and travelers of the period on projects involving their studies. Bartholomew's Atlas of Meteorology and Atlas of Zoogeography were issues from a planned five-volume series that was never completed. Before he died he was able to plan out the first edition of the Times Survey Atlas of the World; this and its succeeding editions represent the most successful atlas project of the twentieth century. John was a great friend of geographer and writer John Francon Williams. Correspondence between the two friends is held in the Bartholomew Archive at the National Library of Scotland. Williams also acted as a literary agent for Bartholomew in America, the UK and other territories in the world.\n\nIn 1889, he married Janet MacDonald.\n\nHe handed the reins of the business on to his son John (Ian) Bartholomew (1890–1962).\n\nA memorial to Bartholomew, sculpted by Pilkington Jackson, exists on the northern wall of the 20th century extension to Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh. His wife Jennie, sons Hugh and Ian Bartholomew, and grandson John Christopher Bartholomew are buried at the monument.\n\nHis daughter Margaret married Philip Francis Hamilton-Grierson, grandson of Sir Philip James Hamilton-Grierson.\n\nOn the centenary of Bartholomew’s death (14 April 2020), he was commemorated publicly and named as a publisher who helped to put ‘Edinburgh on the map’.\n\nChronology\n1860: born in Edinburgh on 22 March\n1880: begins work for his father in the family's map-making business\n1884: co-founder of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society\n1884–1920: honorary secretary, Royal Scottish Geographical Society\n1887: elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh\n1888: succeeds his father in the family business\n1888: elected to the Royal Geographical Society\n1892: secretary, Section E, British Association for the Advancement of Science\n1895: publishes his Survey Atlas of Scotland\n1899: publishes his Atlas of Meteorology\n1903: publishes his Survey Atlas of England and Wales\n1905: receives the Victoria Research Gold Medal from the Royal Geographical Society\n1909–1912: council member, Royal Society of Edinburgh\n1910: appointed Cartographer Royal by King George V\n1911: publishes his Atlas of Zoogeography\n1918: receives the Helen Carver medal from the Geographical Society of Chicago\n1920: dies at Sintra, Portugal, on 14 April\n1922: first edition of the Times Survey Atlas of the World posthumously published\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Bartholomew: A Scottish Family Heritage – site maintained by the family.\n Times World Atlases official website including a History and Heritage section detailing landmark Times atlases\n J.G.

{"id": "4104256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatsa", "title": "Fatsa", "text": "Fatsa is a municipality and district of Ordu Province, Turkey. Its area is 363 km2, and its population is 126,775 (2022). It lies on the Black Sea coast.\n\nName\n\nThe oldest recorded name of the town is Polemonion (, Latinized as Polemonium), after Polemon I of Pontus. A derivative of Polemonion, i.e. Bolaman, is the modern name of the river passing through Fatsa (the river is the ancient Sidenus). The present name, Fatsa, has been influenced by modern Greek Φάτσα or Φάτσα Πόντου (φἀτσα is derived from Italian faccia), which translates as \"face or housefront on the sea\", but has in fact mutated from Fanizan, the name of the daughter of King Pharnaces II of Pontus, through Fanise, Phadisana (), Phadsane Phatisanê Vadisani (), Phabda, Pytane, Facha, Fatsah into today's Fatsa. Apart from Polemonion, another Greek name of the town was Side.\n\nHistory\n\nAntiquity\n\nThe history of Fatsa goes back to antiquity, when the coast was settled by Cimmerians, and Pontic Greeks in the centuries BC. The ruins on Mount Çıngırt (the ancient rock tombs and vaults) are from this period.\n\nRoman and Byzantine periods\n\nFatsa was first mentioned, in the era of the Kingdom of Pontus, as Polemonium, after King Polemon I, the Roman client king appointed by Mark Antony. Under Nero, the kingdom became a Roman province in AD 62. In about 295, Diocletian (r. 284–305) divided the province into three smaller provinces, one of which was Pontus Polemoniacus, called after Polemonium, which was its administrative capital.\n\nAs the Roman Empire developed into the Byzantine Empire, the city lost some of its regional importance. Neocaesarea became the capital of the province, and the Diocese of Polemonion was a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Neocaesarea. Due to partition of the Byzantine Empire as a result of the Fourth Crusade, Fatsa became a part of the Empire of Trebizond in 1204.\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries Genoese traders established trading posts on the Black Sea coast. Fatsa became one of the most important of these ports. There is a stone warehouse on the shore built in this period.\n\nOttoman period\n\nFollowing the conquest of the Empire of Trebizond by the Ottomans in 1461, Fatsa become a part of Rûm Eyalet and later a part of Trebizond Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire and remained within the Sanjak of Janik until the collapse of the Empire in 1921. Fatsa\nbecame a district of Ordu Province, following the formation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923.\n\nArchaeology \nIn 2020, archaeologist discovered ruins of a church at the bottom of the lake Gaga.\n\nPopulation movement\n\nFollowing the Turkish conquest of Anatolia by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and later by the Ottomans, Muslims settler arrived at Fatsa in the middle of the 14th Century. The early Muslim Turkish settlers included Turkomens, whose descendants make up the majority of Fatsa's current Alevi Muslim community. In 1999, a religious worship complex that serves to both Alevis and Sunni Muslims was opened in Fatsa, which was unprecedented in Turkey.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Fatsa's Sunni population increased significantly, as some of Chveneburi (Sunni Muslim Georgians) from Batumi and Kobuleti (Turkish: Çürüksu), who fought in the Ottoman army against the Russian forces in Russo-Turkish War (1877–78) under Ali Pasha of Çürüksu and some of the Abazins and Circassians, who were forced to leave their ancestral land in North Caucasus after the end of the Caucasian War in 1864, were settled in Fatsa and in the surrounding villages. The Circassian immigrants had an immediate impact on the local economy by introducing silk production to the area.  In 1868, 3 million piastres worth of silk was sold in Fatsa.\n\nDuring the Byzantine period, as early as the 9th century, an Orthodox diocese was located in Fatsa (Diocese of Polemonion). Fatsa's  Christian population during the Ottoman era was made up by Pontic Greeks and Armenians, who thrived as craftsmen and bureaucrats. According to the last Ottoman census carried out in 1914, the Christians made up 12% of Fatsa's total population of 40,339. After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Fatsa's Christian population diminished. The last Pontic Greek community left Fatsa in 1923 as a part of the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey, when 770 Muslim families from Thessaloniki, Greece were settled in Fatsa and the indigenous Pontic Greek population of Fatsa were settled in Katerini and in the village of Trilofos Himachal, both in the Pieria region of Greece. Two members of Fatsa's Pontic Greek community, after the population exchange in 1923, became politicians in Greece; Alexander Deligiannidis, born in Fatsa in 1914 served in the Greek Parliament as a member of National Radical Union Party (1956 - 1964) and  Takis Terzopoulos, born in Fatsa in 1920 served as the mayor of Katerini (1964 - 1967).\n\nThe book titled Literary Publications, Testimonials and Narratives in Pieria (1918 - 2010) (Greek: Λογοτεχνικές εκδόσεις, μαρτυρίες και αφηγήσεις στην Πιερία)  includes chronicles of some of Fatsa's Pontic Greeks on their exodus from Fatsa to Katerini, including an anecdotal account by Chalkidis Ef. Theophilus (Greek: Χαλκίδης Ευθ. Θεόφιλος)  (b. Fatsa in 1900 - d. Katerini 1985).\n\nIn 1919, in Fatsa, there were 8 churches (Greek Orthodox, Greek Evangelical and Armenian Apostolic) served by 9 priests. After the departure of the last Christian community in 1923, the churches were closed and later demolished. The last remaining church in Fatsa was in town's Kurtuluş District and was demolished in the late 1980s.\n\nPolitics\n\nSocial Unrest in 1970s - 1980s\n\nDuring the social unrest in Turkey in the 1970s, a major international incident in the area was the kidnapping of three NATO engineers (two British, one Canadian) from the Ünye radar station in 1972 by the members of People's Liberation Army of Turkey, which had a support base in Fatsa.\n\nIn 1976, Nazmiye Komitoğlu was elected as the mayor of Fatsa, who was the first female mayor elected in the Black Sea region of Turkey. Following her death in office, Fikri Sönmez, a local Chveneburi, was elected as the mayor on 14 October 1979. Sönmez and his Marxist–Leninist organisation Devrimci Yol, which was made up by local committees under the slogan \"The red sun will rise in Fatsa\",  controlled the municipality until 11 July 1980.\n\nAfter his election as the mayor, Sönmez divided Fatsa into eleven regions and created people's committees, which had power to recall government authorities. Sönmez was blamed creating a new state inside the Turkish Republic by the prime minister of Turkey at the time, Süleyman Demirel.\n\nThis era ended when, upon the initiative of the Nationalist Movement Party supporting the provincial governor, the\nTurkish military conducted an operation called OperationTarget (Turkish: Nokta Operasyonu) against the town.\nOn 8 July 1980, the Turkish Army surrounded Fatsa. On 9 July the General Staff of Turkish Armed Forces, General Kenan Evren arrived at Fatsa. On 11 July 1980, the army moved into the town, and Mayor Sönmez and 300 others were arrested by the army. OperationTarget is believed to be the rehearsal for the 1980 Turkish coup d'état led by Gen. Kenan Evren.\n\nThroughout this turbulent period, Fatsa lost a significant number of its people as they migrated away to jobs in Turkey's larger cities or abroad. Immigrants from Fatsa constitute the largest proportion of the Turkish community in Japan.\n\nCurrent\n\nThe current mayor of Fatsa is İbrahim Etem Kibar from the conservative AK Party.\n\nGeography and climate\n\nFatsa is located on a strip of coastline between the Black Sea and the Janik Mountains (Turkish: Canik) and watered by the rivers of Elekçi, Bolaman, Yapraklı and Belice. Fatsa has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa); warm and humid in summer, cool and damp in winter, with occasional - but sometimes heavy - snowfalls.\n\nComposition\nThere are 89 neighbourhoods in Fatsa District:\n\n Ahmetler\n Arpalık\n Aşağıardıç\n Aşağıtepe\n Aşağıyavaş\n Aslancami\n Ayazlı\n Bacanak\n Bağlarca\n Bahçeler\n Başköy\n Beyceli\n Bolaman\n Bozdağı\n Bucaklı\n Buhari\n Bülbülköy\n Büyükkoç\n Çömlekli\n Çöteli\n Demirci\n Dereyurt\n Dolunay\n Duayeri\n Düğünlük\n Dumlupınar\n Eskiordu\n Evkaf\n Fatih\n Geyikçeli\n Gölköy\n Güvercinlik\n Hacıköy\n Hamlık\n Hatipli\n Hıdırbeyli\n Hoylu\n Ilıca\n İnönü\n İslamdağ\n Kabakdağı\n Kaleönü\n Karataş\n Kargucak\n Karşıyaka\n Kavraz\n Kayaca\n Kayaköy Akçakese\n Kılavuzömer\n Kılıçlı\n Konakbaşı\n Kösebucağı\n Küçükkoç\n Kulakköy\n Küpdüşen\n Kurtuluş\n Mehmetakif\n Meşebükü\n Mustafa Kemalpaşa\n Oluklu\n Örencik\n Palazlı Kömürlük\n Sakarya\n Salihli\n Saraytepe\n Sazcılar\n Sefaköy\n Şerefiye\n Sudere\n Tahtabaş\n Taşlıca\n Tayalı\n Tepecik\n Uzundere\n Yalıköy\n Yapraklı\n Yassıbahçe\n Yassıtaş\n Yavaş\n Yenidoğan\n Yenikent\n Yenipazar\n Yeniyurt\n Yeşilköy\n Yeşiltepe\n Yukarıardıç\n Yukarıbahçeler\n Yukarıtepe\n Yusuflu\n\nEconomy\n\nThe local economy depends on agriculture and fishing. In the early 20th century, the town thrived as a port and trading post, as there was no coastal road to in the region. There are fishing fleets harboured at the port in Fatsa and in the small districts of Yalıköy and Bolaman (Polemonium) and in the hamlet of Belice, which forms a natural harbour. The Black Sea Coastal Highway runs through Fatsa bringing passing trade.\n\nBefore the 20th century, maize and rice were the main grains grown in the hinterland. From the 1920s onwards, the coastal swamps were dried up by irrigation works, rice growing ceased and the town grew. During this time, hazelnuts were introduced to the area. About 80% of arable land is planted with hazelnuts. The higher mountain areas of the district are covered in forest.\n\nPlaces of interest\n\nThe countryside and coast of Fatsa are lush in spring and summer time.

The current mayor is Ahmet Sel (MHP).\n\nHistory\nThe area was settled by the Hittites in the 16th century BC, the Persians in the 6th century BC, conquered by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, and later passed into the hands of the Romans and Byzantines.\n\nFeke commands a pass across the Taurus mountains directly north of Adana, and a castle was first built in the Byzantine period. The name then was Vahka and has since mutated to today's spelling Feke.\n\nBeginning in the 10th century AD the Byzantine government forcibly settled Armenians into Cilicia to act as guards on the frontier with Syria. With the collapse of Byzantine rule in Asia Minor after the Battle of Manzikert it fell upon the Armenians in Cilicia to defend themselves, and in 1097/98 they managed during the reign of Constantine I to capture this castle and rebuild most of the Greek fortifications. It became an important stronghold for the Rubenid barons, who later became the rulers of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. It was captured by the Mameluks and then the Ottomans.\n\nBelow the castle are the imposing remains of a two-story early Byzantine church and a late antique/medieval town.\n\nThe impressive circuit walls, towers, and vaulted chambers of the castle are positioned at the top of an elongated mountainous outcrop, primarily flanking the more accessible western side.  Sheer cliffs precluded the need for defenses at the east.  The outer gatehouse, which consists of a winding staircase and an elaborate bent entrance, leads to the summit.  Here there are cisterns, residential quarters, and embrasured loopholes for archers.  Most of the exterior masonry is the typical Armenian rusticated ashlar with finely drafted margins.\n\nComposition\nThere are 48 neighbourhoods in Feke District:\n\n Akkaya\n Akoluk\n Bağdatlı\n Bahçecik\n Belenköy\n Çandırlar\n Çondu\n Çürükler\n Değirmenciuşağı\n Gaffaruşağı\n Gedikli\n Göbelli\n Gökçeli\n Gürümze\n Güzpınarı\n Hıdıruşağı\n İncirci\n İslam\n Kaleyüzü\n Karacaoğlan\n Karacauşağı\n Kaşaltı\n Kayadibi\n Kazancı\n Keklikçe\n Kırıkuşağı\n Kısacıklı\n Kızılyer\n Koçyazı\n Konakkuran\n Kovukçınar\n Mansurlu\n Musalar\n Olucak\n Ormancık\n Ortaköy\n Oruçlu\n Paşalı\n Şahmuratlı\n Sülemişli\n Süphandere\n Tenkerli\n Tokmanaklı\n Tortulu\n Uğurlubağ\n Yaylapınar\n Yerebakan\n Yeşildüşmüş\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMunicipality website\nDistrict governor website\nExtensive photographic survey, description and plan of Vahga Castle / Feke\n\n \nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nMamluk castles\nPopulated places in Adana Province\nDistricts of Adana Province"}

{"id": "4104272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopesick%20%28album%29", "title": "Dopesick (album)", "text": "Dopesick is the third studio album by American sludge metal band Eyehategod, released on April 2, 1996. It was reissued in 2006 as part of Century Media's 10th Anniversary series with three bonus tracks that were recorded during the original Dopesick recording sessions.\n\nRecording and production\nAfter the release of Take as Needed for Pain, Eyehategod's previous album, the band recorded several demos, which were released on various 7\" records and splits on various labels, before finally settling down in the fall of 1995 to record a full-length record, Dopesick. The album featured Billy Anderson and Pepper Keenan as producer and co-producer respectively and new bassist Vince LeBlanc. It was recorded at Side One Studios in New Orleans so frontman Mike Williams had to travel often between there and Clinton Hill, Brooklyn in New York City, where he was living at the time.\n\nThe recording sessions were infamously chaotic, and involved the studio owner reportedly calling Century Media to ask if the band was mentally unstable, and threatening to kick them out. This particular incident occurred after Mike Williams had attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for the introduction to the album, by smashing a bottle on the floor of the studio. In the process, he slashed open his hand and bled all over the studio floor; this recording did make it to the record as the introduction to the first track, \"My Name Is God (I Hate You)\". One of the band members then apparently smeared the words \"Hell\" and \"Death to Pigs\" in Williams' blood.\n\nThe album's recording finished during the winter of 1995. After completion, Brian Patton and Joey LaCaze flew out to San Francisco to mix the album at Hyde Street Studio with Billy Anderson, who would also be the album's engineer.\n\nRelease\nThe album was finally released on April 2, 1996. Thanks to the LP, the band was able to embark on a United States tour in the spring of 1997, supporting White Zombie and Pantera, bringing their music to a far wider audience.\n\nOn June 27, 2006, the album was reissued as part of Century Media's 20th Anniversary series of reissues. The new edition included three bonus tracks recorded during the original Dopesick recording sessions.\n\nMusic\nThe album opens with Mike Williams' screams and the sound of a broken bottle. It is somewhat diverse musically, but not in terms of mood. \"Dixie Whiskey\" has a main riff that sounds, reportedly, like a swamp-bred Black Sabbath. \"Dogs Holy Life\" and \"Non Conductive Negative Reasoning\" both feature inventive and ear-grabbing guitar parts before ending abruptly, according to William York of AllMusic. Songs such as \"Peace Thru War (Thru Peace and War)\" and \"Lack of Almost Everything\" alternate up-tempo hardcore punk sections with slowed-down grooves. Dopesick sounds slightly different from the band's previous records because it was produced to sound denser and heavier; with the drums more up front in the mix and the guitars sounding especially thick. Chronicles of Chaos''' Gino Filicetti went so far as to describe Michael Williams' vocals as \"puke-ridden\" in a 1996 review of the album for the webzine.\n\nCritical reception\n\nWilliam York of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 stars of 5, calling it \"an exhausting, challenging listen\" but \"Eyehategod's most musically accomplished and well-rounded statement\". He praised the fact that it is varied musically. The extreme tempo alternations in songs such as \"Peace Thru War (Thru Peace and War)\" and \"Lack of Almost Everything\" were very well received.\n\nIn 2009, the album was chosen as the number 2 sludge record by Terrorizer, which commented that \"[v]icious hardcore punk, crushing metallic comedowns and wave upon merciless wave of feedback serve as both a harrowing soundtrack to their ruined lives and a doomed lovesong to the spirit of the South.\"\n\nTrack listing\nMusic by Jimmy Bower, Brian Patton, Joey LaCaze and Vince LeBlanc. All lyrics written by Mike Williams, except tracks six and seven, by Williams and Alicia Morgan.\n\nThe original version of \"Depress\" can be found in In the Name of Suffering.\n\nUsage in other works\n\"My Name Is God (I Hate You)\", \"Dogs Holy Life\", \"Dixie Whiskey\", \"Ruptured Heart Theory\", \"Lack of Almost Everything\", \"Zero Nowhere\", \"Methamphetamine\", \"Broken Down But Not Locked Up\" and \"Anxiety Hangover\" were covered by different bands for For the Sick, a tribute to Eyehategod by various artists released by Emetic Records. \"Dixie Whiskey\" is also featured in Identity 3...D!, a compilation album released by Century Media Records. Another cover of this track by Intronaut was included in Century Media's cover album Century Media Records: Covering 20 Years of Extremes''.\n\nPersonnel\nEyehategod\nMike IX Williams – vocals\nBrian Patton – lead guitar\nJimmy Bower – rhythm guitar\nVince LeBlanc – bass\nJoey LaCaze – drums\n\nTechnical personnel\nBilly Anderson – production, engineering, mixing\nPerry Cunningham – remastering\nTom Bejgrowitz – additional layout\nCharles Elliott – reissue coordination\n\nOn the album, the credits for each member of the band are shown in a different way.\n\nReferences\n\n1996 albums\nEyehategod albums\nAlbums produced by Billy Anderson (producer)\nCentury Media Records albums"}

{"id": "4104287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fethiye", "title": "Fethiye", "text": "Fethiye () is a municipality and district of Muğla Province, Turkey. Its area is 875 km2, and its population is 177,702 (2022). It is one of the prominent tourist destinations in the Turkish Riviera.\n\nHistory\n\nFethiye was formerly known as Makri (). Modern Fethiye is located on the site of the ancient city of Telmessos, the ruins of which can be seen in the city, e.g. the Hellenistic theatre by the main quay.\n\nA Lycian legend explains the source of the name Telmessos as follows: The god Apollo falls in love with the youngest daughter of the King of Phoenicia, Agenor. He disguises himself as a small dog and thus, gains the love of the shy, withdrawn daughter. After he reappears as a handsome man, they have a son, who they name 'Telmessos' (the land of lights).\n\nThe city became part of the Persian Empire after the invasion of the Persian general Harpagos in 547 BC, along with other Lycian and Carian cities. Telmessos then joined the Attic-Delos Union (Delian League) established in mid-5th century BC. and, although it later left the union and became an independent city, it continued its relations with the union until the 4th century BC. \n\nVery little is known of the city during the Byzantine times. Surviving buildings attest to considerable prosperity during late Antiquity, but most were abandoned in the 7th–8th centuries due to the Arab-Byzantine Wars.  The city was fortified in the 8th century, and appears as \"Telmissos or Anastasioupolis\" ca. 800. By the 10th century, the ancient name was forgotten and it became known as Makre or Makri (Μάκρη, \"long one\"), from the name of the island at the entrance to the harbour. There are signs of renewed prosperity in the 12-13th centuries: the city walls were enlarged, a report from 1106 names Makre a centre for perfume production, and geographical works from the 13th century describe the city as a commercial center. The area fell to the Turks in the late 12th or early 13th century.\n\nTelmessos was ruled by the Anatolian beylik of Menteşe starting in 1284, under the name Beskaza.\n\nIt became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1424, and was called مكرى Meğri until 1934.\n\nFrom 1867 until 1922, Meğri was part of the Aidin Vilayet of the Turkish Empire. The town grew considerably in the 19th century, and had a large Greek population at that time. Following the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the Greeks of Makri were sent to Greece where they founded the town of Nea Makri (New Makri) in Greece. The town was resettled with Turks from Greece. At nearby Kayaköy, formerly Levissi, the abandoned Greek Orthodox church is still standing.\n\nIn 1934, the city was renamed Fethiye in honor of Captain Fethi Bey, one of the first pilots of the Ottoman Air Force, who died (together with First Lieutenant Sadık Bey) during an airplane crash on 27 February 1914 near Al-Samra, while attempting to complete the first flight from Istanbul to Cairo.\n\nOn 3 August 1953, Air France Flight 152, while en route from Rome to Beirut, ditched into the Gulf of Fethiye off Kızılada. Of the 8 crew and 34 passengers on board, four drowned. The survivors were hosted by the residents during their stay in the town.\n\nFethiye has experienced many powerful and occasionally destructive earthquakes, most notably the 1957 Fethiye earthquakes on 24–25 April with 67 casualties and 3,200 damaged or destroyed buildings, which constituted 90% of the buildings in the entire city. The town has been rebuilt since then and now has a modern harbor and a marina.\n\nOn 14 January 1969, Fethiye was struck by an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2, which caused no deaths, but there were some injuries and significant damage to buildings.\n\nOn 10 June 2012, an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1, struck Fethiye. There was no loss of life, but there were some injuries and many houses and workplaces were damaged.\n\nTourism\nFethiye is one of Turkey's well-known tourist centers and is especially popular during the summer. The Fethiye Museum, which is rich in ancient and more recent artifacts, displays and testifies to the successive chain of civilizations that existed in the area, starting with the ancient Lycians. \n\nSome of the historical sites worth visiting are: Kadyanda (Cadyanda) ancient city, Kayaköy - the abandoned Greek village, Afkule, Gemiler and Aya Nikola. Fethiye is also home to the Tomb of Amyntas, a large tomb built in 350 BC by the Lycians. \n\nThe most popular tourist towns of Fethiye are: Ölüdeniz, Çalış Beach area, Hisarönü and Ovacık, Fethiye. Butterfly Valley is in the Fethiye district.\n\nThe island of Kızılada in the Gulf of Fethiye,  off the city, is a popular stopover for boat tours. Alternatively, there are great diving sites, Afkule being one of the most famous. The Kızılada Lighthouse on the island houses a seafood restaurant and a hostel with nine rooms.\n\nComposition\nThere are 41 neighbourhoods in Fethiye District:\n\n Akarca\n Babataşı\n Bozyer\n Cami\n Çamköy\n Çatalarık\n Çenger\n Çiftlik\n Cumhuriyet\n Eldirek\n Esenköy\n Faralya\n Foça\n Göcek\n Gökben\n Gökçeovacık\n İncirköy\n İnlice\n Karaağaç\n Karacaören\n Karaçulha\n Karagedik\n Karagözler\n Karakeçililer\n Kargı\n Kayaköy\n Kesikkapı\n Kızılbel\n Koruköy\n Menteşeoğlu\n Nif\n Ölüdeniz\n Patlangıç\n Pazaryeri\n Söğütlü\n Taşyaka\n Tuzla\n Yakacık\n Yanıklar\n Yeni\n Yeşilüzümlü\n\nClimate\nFethiye has a Mediterranean climate consisting of hot, long and dry summers with an average of 34 °C (93 °F) in the daytime. Climate change is affecting the temperatures with the summers being more hotter and drier than previously. The winters are mild and rainy with a daytime average of 16 °C (61 °F). \n\nThe classification for the climate of Fethiye is Csa (Köppen) and Csal (Trewartha)\n\nTransport\n\nDalaman Airport serves the Fethiye areas. The most common type of public transportation in Fethiye and nearby area is minibus, commonly known in Turkey as dolmuş (dol-moosh) and numerous routes connect Fethiye with Ölüdeniz, Yaniklar, Kargi, Hisaronu, Ovacik, Seydikemer, Karaçulha.\n\nAreas \nThe overall metropolitan area of the city of Fethiye stretches inland from the harbor for more than 11 km, incorporating several villages into the city. To the north of the city center is the area of Çalış Plajı (Beach), which incorporates the main street of Barış Manço Bulvarı alongside an extensive promenade along the coast, on which a lot of hotels are based. This beach serves as Fethiye's beach in its own right, since Fethiye does not actually have one itself. To the east, lie the areas of Günlükbaşı, Çamköy, Cumhuriyet, and also Esenköy to the south-east. The city center is defined as the area between the Marina and the Fethiye Market near the football stadium. Approximately 4 km to the south-west and south respectively, lie the towns of Kayaköy and Ölüdeniz, the latter being world-famous for its beach spit and associated Blue Lagoon. The opportunity for paragliding is available from the mountain of Babadağ in Ölüdeniz, from various extreme sports companies located in the area.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\nMarinas in Turkey\nGöcek, Fethiye\nSeydikemer\nKayaköy\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \nCities in Turkey\nPopulated coastal places in Turkey\nMediterranean port cities and towns in Turkey\nTurkish Riviera\nPopulated places in Muğla Province\nMediterranean Region, Turkey\nDistricts of Muğla Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nAncient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey\nGreece–Ottoman Empire relations\nGreece–Turkey relations\nFormer Greek towns in Turkey"}

It is the seat of Fındıklı District. Its population is 10,886 (2021).\n\nEtymology\nThe town was formerly known as Vitze (Laz and Georgian: Vits'e), which some claim means \"twig\" or \"branch\" in the Laz language and was renamed Fındıklı (\"place with hazelnuts\" in Turkish) after the hazelnuts grown in the town, although these have now mostly been replaced with tea.\n\nScholar Özhan Öztürk claims that the town's former and native name comes from the word vis, meaning \"town\" in the now-extinct Thracian language and other Indo-European languages (Old Persian vith, Avesta visa, Sanskrit vesah, Gothic weihs, etc.). Öztürk claims that Istanbul's old name Byzantion; the town of Vize in Kırklareli Province in western Thracian region of Turkey; the towns of Viçe, Visir, Aşağı Viçe, Arhavi (Arkeo + Vice, \"old town\"), Visera, and Vizera in the Pontus region of Turkey (where Fındıklı is also located); the towns of Bizirne and Bizeri in the Paphlagonia region of Turkey; the towns of Visa, Visani, Viziru, and Vizireni in Romania; and the town of Vis in Bulgaria derive their names from the same origin.\n\nGeography\nLike most Black Sea districts, Fındıklı consists of a small strip of coast and a larger area of hills and mountains behind (which lead up into the Kaçkar Mountains).\n\nThere is little flat land in Fındıklı and most of the population lives in two large valleys, the Çağlayan (Laz: აბუ Abu) and the Arılı (ფიცხალა Pitsxala). The climate is typical of the Black Sea coast, six months of dark cloud, four months overcast, six weeks of light cloud and 19 days of sunshine, with light rain at some point during every one of the 365 days of the year. These conditions are ideal for the crops that drive the local economy, namely tea, hazelnuts, and some other fruits. The town currently produces around 32,000 tons of tea and 750 tons of hazelnuts each year. Other produce include milk, meat, eggs, honey and fish, and the new development is the planting of kiwi fruit.\n\nFındıklı itself is a small market town of 9,980 people. There is little developed industry, and the younger generations regularly migrate away to jobs in larger cities. The town consists of 8 quarters: Aksu, Merkez, Tatlısu, Yenimahalle, Hürriyet, Ilıca, Liman and Sahil.\n\nThe people are mostly ethnic Laz.\n\nHistory\nSee Rize Province for the history the area, once part of the Colchis i.e. Lazica, Roman Empire, Kingdom of Georgia and the Empire of Trebizond, brought into the Ottoman Empire in 1509, and briefly occupied by Russia at the end of World War I.\n\nTwin towns\nFındıklı is twinned with:\n\nReferences\n\nPopulated places in Fındıklı District\nPopulated coastal places in Turkey\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey\nLaz settlements in Turkey"}

His personal best jump was 8.43 metres, achieved in San Giovanni Valdarno on 16 May 1987. This stood as the Italian record until 2007, when Andrew Howe jumped 8.47.

{"id": "4104300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finike", "title": "Finike", "text": "Finike, the ancient Phoenix or Phoinix (), also formerly Phineka, is a municipality and district of Antalya Province, Turkey. Its area is 768 km2, and its population is 49,720 (2022). It lies on the Mediterranean coast of Antalya Province in Turkey, to the west of the city of Antalya, along the Turkish Riviera. It is located on the southern shore of the Teke peninsula, and the coast here is a popular tourist destination. However, Finike is best known for its oranges, the symbol of the town.\n\nHistory\nFor centuries Finike, then named Phoenix (or Phoinix; ) was a port town of ancient Lycia, near the mountain of the same name. It was a trading port and the main port of Limyra, the capital city of Lycia. Phoenix was said to have been founded by Phoenicians in the 5th century BC, and thus named after its founders.\n\nThe area has been inhabited for much longer than that; archaeologists have found evidence near the town of Elmalı showing that the Teke peninsula has been settled since 3000 BC (although on the coast nothing has been uncovered dating before 2000 BC).\n\nTrade along the coast was established first by the Persians, who relinquished Lycia to the armies of Alexander the Great. However, the coast was always vulnerable to forces from Syria, Egypt and Rhodes until it was brought within the empire of the Ancient Romans and the succeeding Byzantines. Even then the Byzantines were threatened by the Arabian armies coming from the Arabian Peninsula. The Battle of the Masts between the Arab and Byzantine fleet took place near Finike in 654.  Eventually the area was lost to the Seljuk Turks in the 13th century. These were succeeded by the Ottoman Empire from 1426.\n\nThe town was inhabited by Greeks prior to the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.\n\nComposition\nThere are 26 neighbourhoods in Finike District:\n\n Akçaalan\n Alacadağ\n Arif\n Asarönü\n Boldağ\n Çamlıbel\n Dağbağ\n Ernez\n Eski\n Gökbük\n Gökçeyaka\n Hasyurt\n İskele\n Kale\n Karşıyaka\n Kızılca\n Kum\n Sahilkent\n Saklısu\n Turunçova\n Yalnız\n Yazır\n Yeni\n Yeşilköy\n Yeşilyurt\n Yuvalı\n\nDemographics\n\nThe district has a population of 49,720 (2022). The town itself has 21,765 inhabitants.\n\nFinike today\n\nThe local economy depends on agriculture, particularly oranges and other citrus fruits. This is supplemented by income from tourism in the summertime, although because of the lucrative orange production and the distance from Antalya, Finike has not seen the large-scale tourism boom that has so radically changed the other coastal districts of Antalya. Finike is a quiet district where people buzz around on mopeds going about their daily lives. Indeed, many of the visitors that Finike does attract are retired people in search of relaxation. That's mostly because of the construction policy of 1980. That policy made the land more suitable for investment in agriculture rather than in hotels, luxury apartments and other tourist attractions.\n\nA type of pale limestone is quarried at Limyra, and sold as a decorative building material. It is cream colored with a homogeneous structure. Moreover, it is extremely light and that makes it ideal for building walking alleys and streets where only light vehicles pass by. The geologist classify the Limura limestone as with medium density.\n\nThe port of Finike is now a yacht marina, and has a small fishing fleet. The coast is rich in marine life, including sea turtles, and fish, including local specialities red porgy (Sparidae) and grouper (Epinephelus); other fish found along the coast include leerfish (Carangidae) and the more widespread Mediterranean varieties such as bluefish, sea bream, sea bass, with swordfish, sardines and others found further out to sea. However, the coast suffers from overfishing, and many varieties, including the porgy, are in decline.\n\nThe beaches of Finike are an important nesting ground for Caretta caretta sea turtles, and the rocky parts of the coast are used by the rare Mediterranean monk seal.\n\nPlaces of interest\nThe ruins of Limyra are to be seen three miles east of the Finike, they consist of a theatre, tombs, Sarcophagi, bas-reliefs, Greek and Lycian inscriptions, etc.\n The ancient city of Arycanda, in a  narrow valley off the road to Elmalı.\n The ruins of Trysa with a carved frieze depicting Theseus, on the road to Kaş.\n The small village of Turuncova, hidden in a small valley of Taurus Mountains, has preserved its traditional lifestyle and culture.\n The cave of Suluin.\n Wreck of a Phoenician merchant ship from about 1200 BC in Cape Gelidonya\n\nThere are doubtless many more places of antiquity that need to be restored.\n\nSee also\n Turkish Riviera\n Blue Cruise\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nFinike CPL\nInformation On Finike\nSetur Finike Yacht Marina\na local information website\nFinike MEM\nFinike HEM\n\nTurkish Riviera\nAntalya\nPopulated places in Antalya Province\nTourist attractions in Antalya Province\nFishing communities in Turkey\nPopulated coastal places in Turkey\nDistricts of Antalya Province\nFormer Greek towns in Turkey\nLycia\n \nPhoenician colonies in Turkey\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nCittaslow"}

In the films he typically played a bumbling character who was slightly more stupid than average, and often explained the message of the film through demonstrating the risks if it was ignored. Films' topics included postal deliveries, how to cross the road, how to prevent the spread of diseases, how to swim and how to drive without causing the road to be unsafe for other users.\n\nFamily\nMassingham's father was H.W. Massingham (1860–1924) the journalist, and his siblings included writer Harold John Massingham (1888–1952), writer Hugh Massingham (1905–1971) and playwright and actress Dorothy Massingham (1889–1933).

{"id": "4104309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPEX%20syndrome", "title": "IPEX syndrome", "text": "Immunodysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked syndrome (IPEX syndrome) is a rare autoimmune disease. It is one of the autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes. Most often, IPEX presents with autoimmune enteropathy, dermatitis (eczema), and autoimmune endocrinopathy (most often Type 1 diabetes), but other presentations exist.\n\nIPEX is caused by mutations in the gene FOXP3, which encodes transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). FOXP3 is widely considered to be the master regulator of the regulatory T cell (Treg) lineage. FOXP3 mutation can lead to the dysfunction of CD4+ Tregs. In healthy people, Tregs maintain immune homeostasis. When there is a deleterious FOXP3 mutation, Tregs do not function properly and cause autoimmunity.\n\nIPEX onset usually happens in infancy. If left untreated, it is often fatal by the age of 2 or 3. A bone marrow transplant is generally considered the best treatment option.  IPEX exclusively affects males and is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner; female carriers of pathogenic FOXP3 mutations do not have symptoms and no female cases are known.\n\nPresentation\n\nClassical triad \nThe classical triad describes the most common symptoms of IPEX: intractable diarrhea, type 1 diabetes, and eczema. Symptoms usually begin shortly after birth.\n\nOther symptoms include: thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, blood disorders, frequent infections, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and food allergies, among others.\n\nEndocrinopathy \nThe most common endocrinopathy associated with IPEX is type 1 diabetes, especially neonatal diabetes. In this type of diabetes, the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells. This makes the pancreas unable to produce insulin. Diabetes can permanently damage the pancreas.\n\nThyroid disorders are also common.\n\nEnteropathy \nThe most common enteropathy associated with IPEX is intractable diarrhea. Vomiting and gastritis are also common. Other manifestations include Celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, and ileus.\n\nSkin manifestations \nThe most common form of skin involvement is dermatitis. It can occur in three forms: eczematiform (mainly atopic dermatitis), ichthyosiform, psoriasiform, or a combination. Other skin manifestations can include cheilitis, onychodystrophy, and alopecia.\n\nEarly life \nIPEX patients are usually born with normal weight and length at term. Nevertheless, the first symptoms may present in the first days of life, and some reported cases labeled newborns with intrauterine growth restriction and evidence of meconium in the amniotic fluid.\n\nGenetics\n\nFOXP3 gene \nIPEX syndrome is inherited in males in an X-linked recessive pattern through the FOXP3 gene. FOXP3'''s cytogenetic location is Xp11.23. The FOXP3 gene has 12 exons and its full reading open frame encodes 431 amino acids. FOXP3 is a member of the FKH family of transcription factors and contains a proline‐rich (PRR) amino‐terminal domain, central zinc finger (ZF) and leucine zipper (LZ) domains important for protein–protein interactions. It also has a carboxyl‐terminal FKH domain required for nuclear localization and DNA‐binding activity. In humans, exons 2 and 7 may be spliced and excluded from the protein.\n\n FOXP3 mutations \nA large variety of mutations have been found, including single base substitutions, deletions, and splicing mutations. Data from 2018 describes over 70 mutations in the FOXP3 gene leading to IPEX syndrome. This number has grown dramatically in the past decade. In 2010 there were only 20 mutations of FOXP3 known in the literature. Some mutations cause FOXP3 expression to malfunction, which leads to a defect in Treg production. Those individuals do not have circulating CD4+/CD25+/FOXP3+ Treg cells. Reduced expression of FOXP3 has been described, and these individuals may express normal levels of dysfunctional protein, which leads to mild symptoms during the neonatal period or later in life. Other individuals express no FOXP3 protein. A common location for mutation of FOXP3 leading to expression of malfunctioning protein is the DNA-binding domain called the forkhead domain. The mutation makes the truncated protein unable to bind to its DNA binding site. This impairs its function concerning Treg development and functioning. The absence or dysfunction of Tregs causes autoimmune symptoms.\n\nFOXP3 pathways\nFOXP3 can function as both a repressor and a trans‐activator of Treg cells depending on its interactions with other proteins. FOXP3 expression is characterised by controlling transcription, influencing epigenetic changes and post-transcriptional modifications. The N‐terminal repressor domain of FOXP3 can change transcription or epigenetic regulation of Treg cells. Transcriptional activity is altered through interactions between the N-terminal domain and Eos - which associates with CtBP1 and forms a corepressor complex. This complex binds the IL2 promoter and enables FOXP3 to repress IL2 transcription in Treg cells. FOXP3 forms complexes with histone deacetylase (HDAC)7, HDAC9, and the histone acetyl transferase TIP60, which alters epigenetic activity of Treg cells. The N‐terminal domain of FOXP3 can also antagonize the transcription factors RORγ and RORα, thereby inhibiting TH17 cell differentiation. FOXP3 is linked to TCR signaling by downstream transcription factors. All of these findings verify the importance of FOXP3 in the regulation of transcriptional activity and repression in Treg cells.\n\nDiagnosis\nEarly detection of the disease is crucial because IPEX has a high mortality level if left untreated. IPEX is usually diagnosed based on the following criteria:\n Clinical triad\n Family history\n Laboratory findings: elevated serum concentration of IgE, eosinophilia, autoimmune anemia and decreased number of FOXP3 Treg cells.\n Genetic testing: single-gene testing and multigene panel.\n\nTreatment\n\nIndividuals with IPEX will usually need supportive care in a hospital. Most common is nutritional treatment for enteropathy and insulin therapy for T1D. IPEX treatment tends to focus on managing symptoms, reducing autoimmunity, and/or treating secondary conditions. Usually, treatment will involve immunosuppression.\n\nDrugs used include:\n Cyclosporin A\n Tacrolimus\n Sirolimus\n Rituximab\nCurrently, the standard treatment for IPEX is a bone marrow transplant. If donor-recipient chimerism is achieved, individuals with IPEX can achieve complete remission.\n\nResearch\nIn 1982, Powel et al. published a case report of a family with 19 males who were affected by an X-linked syndrome with symptoms including polyendocrinopathy and diarrhea. The most common symptoms in this family were severe enteropathy, T1D, and dermatitis. Only 2 of the 19 affected males in the family survived past 3 years old. These individuals lived to 10 and 30 years old. Powel's study is now widely considered the first documentation of IPEX.\n\n Scurfy mouse Scurfy is a type of model mouse used for immunology research. Scurfy mice have had 2 base pairs inserted within the FOXP3 gene. This leads to a frameshift mutation in FOXP3 gene and the expressed protein is truncated, causing functional deficiency of Treg cells. Then, autoreactive CD4+T cells and inflammatory cells cause tissue damage. Scurfy mice have an enlarged spleen and lymph nodes, squinted red eyes, and scaly or \"ruffled\" skin. The mice also have immunity problems and tend to die approximately 3 weeks after birth. From 2000 - 2001, multiple studies confirmed that IPEX is the human equivalent of scurfy'' mice and that the FOXP3 gene is responsible.\n\nSee also \n Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome\n FOXP3\n Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\nAutoimmune diseases\nTranscription factor deficiencies\nDiseases of immune dysregulation\nSyndromes affecting immunity\nRare genetic syndromes"}
{"id": "4104319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin%20Neale", "title": "Kevin Neale", "text": "Kevin Neale (18 July 1945 – 17 September 2023) was an Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Later in his career, he was a player-coach or captain-coach for a number of teams in the Australian Capital Territory, before eventually becoming a full-time coach.\n\nSt Kilda \nKevin Neale was born on 18 July 1945. He was recruited from Hampden Football League (HFL) club South Warrnambool, where he played in seven grand finals in a row. He was nicknamed \"Cowboy\". The origin of the nickname is uncertain; it was possibly for his bow-legs and his rolling gait, but coach Alan Jeans once said he played like a cowboy. \n\nRecruited by St Kilda as a nineteen-year-old, ,  ruckman, Neale played his first match for St Kilda against North Melbourne on 22 May 1965 (round 6), as a back-pocket/ruckman. He initially played in the backline (as the first change, resting in the back-pocket ruckman), but was moved to full-forward in 1966. He was selected as the back-pocket ruckman in St Kilda's \"Team of the Century\" in May 2001. He kicked five goals in St Kilda's 1966 Grand Final win over Collingwood, and held the club record of 16 finals games, until it was beaten by Robert Harvey. Neale was known for a brutal bump on Peter Hudson in the 1971 VFL grand final. A concussed Hudson kicked into the man on the mark, losing his chance to beat Bob Pratt's record of 150 goals in a single season. The Saints went on to lose the match. Nonetheless, Neale won the club best and fairest award in 1973.\n\nNeale played for Victoria in the interstate match against Tasmania in Hobart, on Saturday, 16 June 1967. He was selected at full-forward, and kicked four goals in the match (he was moved from full-forward in the second half because Victoria's centre half-forward Peter McKenna had not kicked a goal in the first half of the match).\n\nAt the end of the 1976 season, it was thought that Neale would retire from playing with St Kilda; however, the team prevailed upon him to play yet another season, and he played in 20 of St Kilda's 22 matches that season, playing his last match as the back-pocket ruckman, in a losing St Kilda side, 17.10 (112), against Richmond 25.21 (171) at the MCG on 27 August 1977 (round 22).\nIn his VFL career at St Kilda, he had played in 256 games, and scored 301 goals.\n\nAustralian Capital Territory \nTowards the end of his career at St Kilda, numerous offers were made to Neale to leave St Kilda and take up a coaching position. At the start of 1975, he was offered the position of player-coach at Turvey Park in the South-West League for three years at $25,000 () per annum. St Kilda talked him out of accepting the lucrative offer; however, towards the end of the 1975 season, the Albury Football Club in the Ovens & Murray Football League offered him a three-year contract totalling $35,000 () as captain-coach, which worked out to be about $11,667 () per annum, about one-third of the original Turvey Park offer.\n\nIn 1978, he moved to Canberra, and was appointed the captain-coach of the Ainslie Football Club. In that year, he was also the captain-coach of a combined Australian Capital Territory (ACT) team in the Escort Cup competition. He was still very effective at full-forward, setting a goal-kicking record in 1980. With Neale as its captain-coach, Ainslie won the premiership in 1979, 1980, 1982 and 1983.\n\nNeale was the captain-coach of the combined ACT side that beat the Victorian team by 13 points, 13.17 (95) to 11.16 (82), on 6 July 1980 at Manuka Oval in front of a crowd of 10,600. He scored three goals.\n\nCoached by Bill Stephen, the Victorians were a very strong team including club captains and Brownlow medallists: Francis Bourke of Richmond, captain, Trevor Barker of St Kilda, Malcolm Blight of North Melbourne, Terry Bright of Geelong, Jim Buckley of Carlton, Robert DiPierdomenico of Hawthorn, Jim Edmond of Footscray, Robert Elliott of Melbourne, Neville Fields of South Melbourne, Laurie Fowler of Richmond, Steven Icke of North Melbourne, Rene Kink of Collingwood, Mark Lee of Richmond, Mark Maclure of Carlton, Alex Marcou of Carlton, Merv Neagle of Essendon, Jeff Sarau of St Kilda, Laurie Serafini of Fitzroy, and Michael Turner of Geelong.\n\nFor a number of reasons, Ainslie had experienced a dismal 1981 season; but, under the coaching of Neale and, particularly, due to his superb on-field leadership and strength at full-forward, Ainslie won the 1982 premiership. At the end of 1982, he was interviewed by St Kilda, with a view to him replacing Alex Jesaulenko. Neale demanded $50,000 as his salary (St Kilda eventually appointed the ex-Richmond coach Tony Jewell).\n\nIn 1983, he began the 1983 season as the captain-coach of the Ainslie Football Club, and was playing as well as he had ever been, despite his advanced age and increased weight.\n\nWith Neale in the team, Ainslie won the 1983 premiership; the fourth in his six years as captain-coach. In the 1980 season, he kicked 149 goals; in the 1981 season, he kicked 139 goals; and in the 1982 season, he kicked 125 goals.\n\nSouth Australia \nBecause he was no longer able to take the field as a player, Neale was reluctantly released by the Ainslie Football Club, since their club and team structure at the time demanded a playing coach (the club eventually appointed ex-Richmond/ex-Collingwood player Rod Oborne as the captain-coach for the 1984 season).\n\nCleared by Ainslie, Neale moved to coach the Central District Football Club in the SANFL. He was non-playing coach from 1984 to 1987.\n\nTuggeranong \nNeale coached the Tuggeranong Football Club for three seasons (1993–1995). He coached Ainslie again in 1998.\n\nDeath \nKevin Neale died from complications of Alzheimer's disease on 17 September 2023, at age 78.\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences \n\n St Kilda Hall of Fame Profile\n Saints honour roll\n\n1945 births\n2023 deaths\nSt Kilda Football Club players\nSt Kilda Football Club premiership players\nTrevor Barker Award winners\nAinslie Football Club players\nAinslie Football Club coaches\nCentral District Football Club coaches\nSouth Warrnambool Football Club players\nAustralian rules footballers from Victoria (state)\nVFL/AFL premiership players\nDeaths from Alzheimer's disease"}

It is located on the highway from Istanbul to Ankara (approximately  from Ankara, where the road to the Black Sea coast branches off). It is the seat of Gerede District. Its population is 23,547 (2021). Elevation is about 1,300 m. The mayor is Mustafa Allar (AKP).\n\nHistory\n\nIn Roman times, the town was called Cratia (Κρατεία) and was part of the Roman province of Honorias, whose capital was Claudiopolis in Honoriade.\n\nEcclesiastical history\nCratia was a metropolitan see, also called Flaviopolis or Flavianopolis. The names of some its bishops are known because of their participation in ecumenical councils: Epiphanius at the Council of Ephesus (431), Genethlius represented by the priest Eulogius at the Council of Chalcedon (451), Diogenes at the Second Council of Constantinople (553), Georgius at the Third Council of Constantinople (680–681), Constantinus or Constans at the Second Council of Nicea (787), Basilius at the Council of Constantinople (869), as well as at the Council of Constantinople (879). In addition, Philetus was one of the Eastern Arian bishops who withdrew from the Council of Sardica in about 344 and set up a rival council at Philippopolis. Paulus stood firm against the Empress Aelia Eudoxia in her persecution of John Chrysostom in 403. Plato was a member of a synod that met in 518. Abramius took part in the synod called in 536 by Patriarch Menas of Constantinople. No longer a residential bishopric, Cratia is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nOttoman period\n\nUnder the Ottoman Empire, Gerede was an established town and was visited by the 16th-century traveller Evliya Çelebi, who described a town of 1,000 homes and 10 mosques, with a military base.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Gerede was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nFor many the name Gerede evokes Hüsrev Gerede, a key companion of Atatürk in the Turkish War of Independence (of 1919-1922). He was later given the surname Gerede for his success in leading the town's rebellion against the occupying forces during that conflict.\n\nPresent state \n\nGerede today is a small town with a number of tanneries and leather workshops, but even though the highway is so close the town is growing slowly, perhaps because of the forbidding climate. \n\nGerede has many high meadows (yayla) and places in the forest for walking and picnics, particularly near the wood of Esentepe. A number of Turkish football teams have their summer training camps here, attracted by the fresh mountain air. Esentepe also has ski slopes and cross-country skiing in winter.\n\nHistory of Gerede district in which Esentepe Natural Park is located goes back to AC 3-4th century. Esentepe Natural Park is a beautiful place in which unique antique trees. The height of the Esentepe Natural Park is 1450 meters, and it is located on 407 square meter area. Esentepe Natural Park has te centennial trees which have long history.\n\nIn 1988, after opening a 100-bed capacity 3-star hotel in Esentepe Natural Park, the number of foreign and domestic tourists has increased. Due to its nearness, the number of visitors coming from Ankara and Istanbul has also increased.\n\nNature\nGerede has a very rich variety of flora and fauna. In this region red deer, roe deer, wild boar, grey wolf, red fox, golden jackal, marten, brown bear, European badger, hedgehog, shrew, Eurasian lynx, wild cat, jungle cat, hare, mole, stoat, weasel, mallard duck, common pochard, ruddy shelduck, red-breasted goose, greylag goose, golden eagle, eastern imperial eagle, greater spotted eagle, rough-legged buzzard, long-legged buzzard, common buzzard, Eurasian eagle-owl, long-eared owl, little owl, barn owl, European bee-eater, goldcrest, short-toed eagle, western marsh harrier, northern goshawk, Eurasian sparrowhawk, black kite, hen harrier, saker falcon, barbary falcon, Eurasian hobby, common kestrel, red-footed falcon, great spotted woodpecker, green woodpecker, hoopoe, blue-cheeked bee-eater, white stork, black stork, raven, common quail, partridge, common kingfisher, red squirrel, southern crested newt, banded newt, smooth newt, common toad, European green toad, European tree frog, European spadefoot toad, agile frog, long-legged wood frog, marsh frog, Caspian turtle, spur-thighed tortoise, stellion, slowworm, sheltopusik, Darevskia, European green lizard, Balkan green lizard, Ophisops elegans, common wall lizard, grass snake, Caspian whipsnake, Coronella austriaca, Aesculapian snake, Elaphe quatuorlineata, dice snake, otter, various rodents, various carps like fish and trouts are found.

Its area is 1,942 km2, and its population is 50,676 (2022). It is near one of the sources of the Ceyhan River (ancient Pyramos), in the ancient region of Cataonia.\n\nHistory \nCucusus has an ancient history, first included in Cataonia, then in Cappadocia, and then in the Roman province of Armenia Secunda. The Byzantine bishops, Paul the Confessor (died 350 AD), John Chrysostom (died 407 AD) and Emperor Basiliscus (died 476 AD) either died in or were exiled to this remote place. Of its bishops, Domnus took part in the Council of Chalcedon (451), Longinus was a signatory of the joint letter of the bishops of the province of Armenia Secunda to  Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian in 458 concerning the murder of Proterius of Alexandria, Ioannes was at the Second Council of Constantinople (553), and another Ioannes at the Trullan Council of 692. No longer a residential bishopric, Cucusus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nIn the mid-10th century the town received many Armenian immigrants and by 1097, when the army of the First Crusade marched arrived at Cucusus, they encountered a large prosperous town populated by Armenians. The town, most likely with its own wall, remained under control of the Armenian princes of Cilicia but was abandoned due to Türkmen raids around 1375, with its inhabitants taking refuge in the towns of Hadjin and Zeitun. After that, the town became part of the Beylik of Dulkadir before it was conquered by the Ottomans in 1515. In April 1915, the remaining Armenian population of Cucusus was deported during the Armenian Genocide.\n\n2009 helicopter crash \n\nOn March 25, 2009, a chartered helicopter carrying Great Union Party's (BBP) Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu, three of his party's local leaders, and a reporter crashed at Mount Keş.

A massive search and rescue operation, attended by thousands and assisted by helicopters and aircraft, was conducted. However, the wreckage and the five bodies were recovered only 47 hours later.

Clever and articulate, he was known as the Khatib (orator) of his tribe, and his opinion carried great weight among them.\n\nFamily \nHe was the son of Amr ibn Abd Shams, of the Amir ibn Luayy clan, and Uzza bint Sufyan, from the Umayya clan, both of the Quraysh tribe. He had four half-brothers.\nSakran ibn Amr, whose mother was Hiyah bint Qays al-Khuzaiyah. He was the first husband of Sawdah bint Zam'ah and the father of Abdulrahman.\nHatib, whose mother was Asma bint al-Harith ibn Nawfal. He was the husband of Rayta bint Alqama and the father of Amr.\nSahl, whose mother was also Asma bint al-Harith ibn Nawfal. He was the husband of Safiyya bint Amr ibn Abd al-Wud and the father of Amir.\nSulayt, whose mother was Khawla bint Amr ibn al-Harith. He was the husband of Fatima bint Alqama and father of Salit.\n\nSuhayl is described as a tall, fair-skinned, handsome man of pleasant appearance, though he had a cleft lower lip.\n\nHe married three times and had several children.\nFatima bint Abdul-Uzza\nHind bint Suhail, who married Hasan ibn Ali and was the mother of Yaqoub and Abdurrahman.\nUmm Kulthum, who married Abu Sabra ibn Abu Ruhm and was the mother of Sa'd, Sabra, Abdullah and Muhammad.\nSahla bint Suhail, who married Abu Hudhayfa ibn 'Utba and was the mother of Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa. \nFakhita bint Amir ibn Nawfal\nAbdullah, who married Layla bint Abdullah and was the father of Umar ibn Abdullah and Ubaydullah.\nAl-‘As (later known as Abu Jandal), who married Safiya bint Abd al-Uzza and was the father of Jandal and Abd-Allah.\nAl-Hunfa' bint Abu Jahl.\nYazid, who married Ruqayya bint Abdullah ibn Abi Qays and was the father of Abu al-Hasan and Umm al-Hasan.\n\nEarly Islam\nSuhayl was one of the elders of Mecca in the earliest days of Islam. He was among those tasked with feeding the pilgrims.\n\nHe was one of the leaders who refused to protect Muhammad on his return from Ta'if in 620, saying, \"Amir ibn Luayy do not give protection against the clans of Kaab,\" the latter being the majority of the Quraysh.\n\nIn 622, the Quraysh heard that some pilgrims from Medina had met with Muhammad at Aqaba and pledged to fight them. Suhayl and some others pursued the Medinans and captured one of their leaders, Sa'd ibn Ubadah. They tied his hands to his neck with his own belt and dragged him by the hair back to Mecca, beating him as they went. Sa'd said that he expected Suhayl to treat him well, but Suhayl delivered \"a violent blow in the face\". However, when Sa'd called for help, the Quraysh realised he had allies in Mecca and they let him go.\n\nIn 624, Suhayl and his son Abdullah set out with the Quraysh army to meet Abu Sufyan's caravan. When they reached Badr, where Muhammad's army was waiting, Abdullah deserted the Quraysh and joined the Muslim side for the Battle of Badr. Suhayl was among those captured and taken prisoner at the battle. Umar offered to knock out his two front teeth so that \"his tongue will stick out and he will never be able to speak against you again;\" but Muhammad would not allow it. Suhayl was brought to Medina with his hands roped to his neck. He was brought to the house of his former sister-in-law, Sawda, and some disbelievers who call themselves muslims made up false statements stating that Sawda said: \"I could hardly contain myself when I saw Abu Yazid in this state and I said, 'O Abu Yazid, you surrendered too readily! You ought to have died a noble death!\". Such blasphemous and disbelief words were never reported through strong chain of narrations. The citation is from the book which was written by disbelievers and translated into English by disbelievers as well (Oxford press). The narration regarding this situation is reported in Sunan Abu Dawud 2680 where such disbelief words attributed to Sawda do not exist, and the narration itself is weak.\n\nIn due course Mikraz ibn Hafs ibn al-Akhyaf came to negotiate Suhayl's ransom, which Muhammad agreed to take in camels. Since Mikraz did not have the animals with him, he remained in Medina as security while Suhayl returned to Mecca to arrange the payment.\n\nSuhayl was instrumental in concluding the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah in 628. He insisted that the treaty be signed from the Muslim side as Muhammad, son of Abdullah (Muhammad ibn Abdullah) rather than the Prophet Muhammad, saying that the Qurayshi side did not accept his prophethood. Before the writing-up was finished, Suhayl's son Abu Jandal appeared, saying he was a Muslim and wanted to go to Medina. Suhayl slapped his face and reminded Muhammad that they had just agreed that no Meccans would be allowed to desert to Medina. Muhammad concurred, and Abu Jandal had to return to Mecca. Umar walked beside him, offering a sword, which he hoped Abu Jandal would use to kill his father; but Abu Jandal did not take it.\n\nSuhayl joined Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl in Mecca's final resistance against Muhammad at Khandama Pass. However, the resistance was flattened by Khalid ibn al-Walid's cavalry. When Muhammad entered Mecca as a conqueror, Suhayl converted to Islam along with everyone else. Muhammad gave him a gift of a hundred camels \"to win over his heart\".\n\nHe calmed the Muslims in Mecca after the death of Muhammad.\nHe participated in the battle of Yarmuk alongside the Muslims.\n\nDeath\nHe died in 639 from the plague epidemic in Imwas, a small village near Jerusalem in Palestine.\n\nReferences\n\nCompanions of the Prophet\nQuraysh\n7th-century deaths from plague (disease)\n639 deaths\n556 births"}

Its area is 217 km2, and its population is 175,940 (2022). The city is located at the northern gulf of Armutlu Peninsula on the coast of Gulf of İzmit, a branch of the Sea of Marmara, in the south of the province.\n\nIt is the district, where the 1999 earthquake disaster happened. Gölcük is the location of one of the Turkish Navy's main naval bases. Also, Ford Otosan automobile plant is located in Gölcük. The mayor is Ali Yıldırım Sezer (AKP).\n\nHistory \nIt would be more appropriate to start the historical development of Gölcük with the region that the Ancient Greeks and Romans called Bithynia, which also includes Izmit and its surroundings. It is thought that Gölcük was known as Diolkides (Diolkídis in antiquity).\n\nThe first step for Gölcük to become a garrison city was taken in 1927. The technical need that emerged with the decision to repair the battleship Yavuz, which was damaged in 1925, led to the establishment of a military shipyard in Gölcük. A pool was built in the same year. The Germans built barracks and repaired Yavuz. Later, these facilities established by the Germans were purchased and the core of the shipyard was established. Parallel to the development of the Turkish Naval Forces, although the fundamental studies were started in 1938, II. World War II prevented these works and the real development of Gölcük Shipyard has been realized since 1950. Gölcük is truly a city founded after the Republic. Except for Halidere, Ulaşlı and Yazlık villages of Gölcük, 21 villages were administered by the Bahçecik Sub-district Directorate of Izmit sanjak.\n\nAfter the proclamation of the Republic, the town center and the Gendarmerie were established in the village of İhsaniye in 1930. The population of the city of Gölcük started to increase rapidly with the workers and their families coming from the Istanbul shipyards to work in the workshops established for the repair of the battleship Yavuz. In the meantime, Gölcük district was established with the law numbered 3012, which was adopted on June 9, 1936 and entered into force on June 15, 1936. Due to the absence of a building suitable for government offices in Gölcük in the accident organization, it started to work temporarily in the rented buildings in the town of Değirmendere. The Government Mansion, whose construction was completed in a short time, was passed in 1938 and the State organization was settled in Gölcük.\n\nWith the establishment of the boiler, the Subdistrict Directorate was abolished from İhsaniye, leaving only the Gendarmerie Organization. In the expropriations made with the Special Expropriation Law No. 3887 enacted in 1942, the Government Organization was transferred to Değirmendere in February 1944, with a decision taken by the Provincial General Assembly, since the Government Mansion remained within the expropriation area. After staying in Değirmendere for 10 years, the government moved back to Gölcük in accordance with the law no. 6322 enacted on March 4, 1954. Due to the government's arrival in Gölcük, the District and Population Organization and the Police Department were established in Değirmendere. This number has increased to 23 by taking Halidere and Ulaşlı villages of Gölcük, which has 21 villages, from Karamürsel. However, with Değirmendere becoming a township, the number of villages decreased to 22. When Damlar District of Saraylı village became a detached village in 1959, the number of villages increased to 23 again.\n\nThe Municipality Organization was established in İhsaniye village with the decision of the Council of Ministers dated 06.09.1966 and numbered 4636. Today Gölcük district, one (centre) Gölcük, others; It has 6 towns and 23 villages, namely Değirmendere, İhsaniye, Halıdere, Ulaşlı, Hisareyn, Yazlık.

In the 7th century it passed to the Arab Caliphate. In 8th century it became part of Kuropalatine of Iberia in struggle against the Arab occupation. During the 10th–15th centuries, this region was a part of the united Georgian Kingdom. In the 16th century, it was within the independent Principality of Samtskhe until it was occupied and annexed by the Ottoman Empire and organized into the Childir Eyalet. Merdenek was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1878, where it was part of the militarily administered Kars Oblast, specifically within the Gelsky uchastok (subcounty) of the Ardahan Okrug. The district included villages inhabited by various ethnic groups, including 40 Turkish and 13 Caucasian Greek villages. Merdenek was briefly occupied by the Ottoman Empire by virtue of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, however, following their withdrawal in 1919, Armenian control prevailed until late 1920. During the Turkish–Armenian War, the town was occupied by Democratic Republic of Georgia; in 1921, it was annexed by Turkey, as confirmed by the Treaty of Kars.\n\nPlaces of interest to visitors include the tomb and mosque in the village of Dedeşen and the castles of Kalecik and Ugurtaşı.\n\nNotable people\n \n\nİsmail Ateş (born 1960), artist and professor\n\nReferences\n\nPopulated places in Ardahan Province\nHistorical regions of Georgia (country)\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey\nGöle District\nKurdish settlements in Turkey"}

{"id": "4104423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKPG-TV", "title": "CKPG-TV", "text": "CKPG-TV (analogue channel 2) is a television station in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, affiliated with Citytv. The station is owned by the Jim Pattison Broadcast Group, and maintains studios on 3rd Avenue (near Winnipeg Street) in Prince George; its transmitter is located atop Pilot Mountain.\n\nCKPG also operates rebroadcasters in Hixon (CKPG-TV-1, channel 10), Mackenzie (CKPG-TV-4, channel 6), and Quesnel (CKPG-TV-5, channel 13).\n\nHistory\nThe station first signed on the air on August 20, 1961, originally operated as a CBC affiliate. It was founded by the owner of local radio station CKPG (1230 AM, now CKDV-FM on 99.3 FM), broadcasting at a transmitter power output of 8,300 watts. The station's president and general manager, Bob Harkins, was one of the first people to appear on-air. In 1965, the station signed on a rebroadcaster in Quesnel on VHF channel 13. In April 1969, both the radio and television stations were purchased by Vancouver-based Q Broadcasting Ltd., owners of CHQM in Vancouver.\n\nOn December 12, 1970, Brian \"Spinner\" Spencer, a rookie hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs from Fort St. James, was called up to play with the Leafs in what would be his first NHL game on television. He called back home to his father, Roy Spencer, to tell him to watch the game that night on Hockey Night in Canada. Spencer was to be interviewed between periods during the game. However, CKPG-TV instead aired a game between the Vancouver Canucks and the California Golden Seals in place of the Maple Leafs-Chicago Black Hawks matchup. Infuriated, Roy Spencer drove  to CKPG-TV's Prince George studios and ordered the technicians at gunpoint to broadcast the Maple Leafs game instead. The station complied, but as Roy Spencer left the station, he was confronted by RCMP officers. After a brief stand-off, Roy Spencer was shot and killed. The event was later depicted in the 1993 Atom Egoyan-directed made-for-TV movie Gross Misconduct.\n\nIn 1973, Gord Leighton was appointed general manager of CKPG-TV and CKPG radio. By 1985, the station had operated six rebroadcasting stations, including three that were owned by the CBC, operating in Hixon, Mackenzie, Quesnel, Vanderhoof, Fort Fraser and Fort St. James. On November 2, 1986, Harkins was awarded the Jeanne Clarke Memorial Local History Award for his contributions to local history and the community. He also served two terms as an alderman, and was involved with the station's operations until he accepted a position at rival radio station CJCI (97.3 FM). Harkins would return to CKPG-TV in the early 1990s, being seen regularly on the programme Community Close-up, on news segments Harkins Comment and Harkins History, and on a station-produced video, Portraits: Bob Harkins.\n\nIn 1988, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) renewed the network licence for CKPG-TV and Terrace station CFTK-TV, which allowed the two CBC affiliates to use the corporation's microwave equipment to transfer syndicated programming, when it was not being used for transmitting CBC programs. In 1990, Q Broadcasting Ltd. sold Radio Station CKPG Ltd., and its CKPG Television Ltd. subsidiary, to Monarch Broadcasting. Harkins died at the age of 69 on November 28, 2000. Nearly one month later, on December 21, the CRTC approved the buyout of Monarch Broadcasting by the Jim Pattison Broadcast Group, a division of the Jim Pattison Group, which included CKPG-TV and its retransmitter stations.\n\nIn 2001, CKPG-TV and its sister radio stations were a part of the 24-hour Relay for a Friend, held on May 5 and 6 of that year. This event raised $260,000 for cancer research and services. In July 2002, Ken Kilcullen was appointed general manager of CKPG-TV, along with its sister stations CKKN-FM and CKDV-FM. In the fall of 2003, the station was added to Bell ExpressVu's basic tier; competing satellite provider Star Choice later began carrying the station in February 2004. In May 2004, CKPG-TV received the Special Program of the Year award from the BC Association of Broadcasters for its special Crossing the Line, which looked at softwood lumber. On August 27 that year, the CRTC renewed CKPG-TV's licence, recognizing the station's commitment to local news (it carried over ten hours of local programming per week) and extended its CBC affiliation through August 31, 2008. In September 2004, the operations of CKPG-TV and its sister radio stations moved into new studio facilities at 1810 3rd Avenue.\n\nWhen CBC Television went to a 24-hour schedule in October 2006, CKPG-TV increased the amount of CBC programming in its schedule. Along with the increase in overall hours of programming, the station increased its local programming to over 12 hours a week, including additions of its daily news and information programming.\n\nIn September 2007, CKPG announced plans to disaffiliate from the CBC after its affiliation term ended on August 31, 2008. Documents filed with the CRTC indicate the station would begin receiving programming from Canwest. As Global station CHAN already broadcasts over-the-air in Prince George (via a rebroadcast transmitter), CKPG became an E! affiliate, as did Kamloops station CFJC. It was announced that CKPG's retransmitters would not be replaced by the CBC; following the switch to E!, CBC's Vancouver station CBUT became the market's default affiliate through its availability on cable and satellite in Prince George (CBUT's existing rebroadcasters would later shut down in 2012, as part of austerity measures imposed by the network).\n\nIt was later announced that the rebroadcast transmitters of another former CBC affiliate that switched to E!, CHAT-TV in Medicine Hat, would not be replaced by the CBC. All three areas became served by other television networks, including the E! system. However, despite the light Francophone population in the absence of an Anglophone network, Radio-Canada station CBUFT out of Vancouver is still available over-the-air in Prince George and Kamloops, and CBUFT's Edmonton sister station CBXFT is still available in Medicine Hat.\n\nOn July 14, 2009, the Jim Pattison Group announced that CKPG and its other E! stations would affiliate with Rogers Media's Citytv system starting September 1; despite this, the stations did not incorporate any form of \"Citytv\" branding. CKPG and CFJC would also become part of a new regional sales initiative  known as \"inTV\". Canwest had previously announced it would either sell or close its E! stations, leaving the Pattison stations without a programming source. On May 3, 2012, Rogers announced the renewal of the Citytv affiliation agreement with Jim Pattison Group, originally slated to expire that August. Beginning September 1, 2012, CKPG began carrying 90% of Citytv's prime time schedule and the majority of its morning and daytime lineup in pattern with Vancouver's CKVU-DT (including a simulcast of the Vancouver edition of Breakfast Television), opting out for local midday and evening newscasts.\n\nHistorically, CKPG aired Hockey Night in Canada dated back to the days of CBC affiliation. However, when Rogers bought the national rights to the NHL in November 2013, the Pattison affiliates began to air Hockey Night once again in October 2014.\n\nNews operation\nCKPG-TV presently broadcasts 15 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with three hours each weekday); the station does not produce any newscasts on weekends. CKPG-TV's local newscasts are titled CKPG News; the station carries a 30-minute lunch hour newscast at noon, an hour-long early evening newscast from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. and again from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. along with a 30-minute newscast at 11:00 p.m. on weekdays only. Recorded versions of the 11:00 p.m. newscast are re-aired during overnight hours, until 7am the following morning. The station also produces CKPG News Week in Review, a half-hour recap of the week's top local news stories that airs on Saturdays at Noon and 6:00 p.m., with repeat broadcasts at Noon and 6:00 p.m. on Sunday along with Monday mornings at 6:00 a.m.\n\nTransmitters\n\nCKPG-TV's programming was originally repeated on CBC-owned transmitters in Vanderhoof (CBCB-TV-1, channel 18), Fort Fraser (CBCB-TV-2, channel 13) and Fort St. James (CBCB-TV-3, channel 7); these transmitters switched to CBUT following CKPG-TV's disaffiliation from the CBC.\n\nDigital television and high definition\nAs of September 2008, CKPG has not yet begun broadcasting a digital signal. According to a 2009 CRTC decision, CKPG-TV is not required to activate its digital signal, as Prince George is not a mandatory market for digital conversion, which took place in most other markets on August 31, 2011. When CKPG-DT signs on its digital signal, it will broadcast on UHF channel 34. However, through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers will display CKPG-DT's virtual channel as its analogue-era VHF channel 2.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nCKPG-TV official website\n \n \n\nKPG-TV\nTelevision channels and stations established in 1961\nKPG-TV\nMass media in Prince George, British Columbia\nJim Pattison Group\n1961 establishments in British Columbia"}

Elevation is  above sea level.\n\nNames and etymology\nThe oldest known name of the town is Asepsus (Ασεψούς in Ancient greek). This was also the name of the brook, that flows next to the city center and was crossed by the Roman Aesepus Bridge. Research shows that the subsequent name was Artemea (Αρτεμέα), a derivation of the Greek goddess Artemis.\n\nAfter the Ottoman conquest the name Gönen was used. The etymological source of that name is still disputed. Widely accepted possibilities are:\n\n Non-Turkish possibilities:\n Ka-wana : A word meaning \"Sheepland/Sheep Country\"  in Luwian\n Germenon : A word meaning \"Hot Spring\"\n Giunan : A word meaning \"Greek\" (Yion in ancient Greek), becoming \"Giunen\" and then \"Gonen\" in Turkish\n Possible meanings in Turkish:\n A small pond that dries in summer, small pond, placid water \n Humid, wet, well-watered.\n\nAlso, some sources indicate that there was a nomadic tribe of the \"Yörükan community\" bearing the name \"Gönen\",\"Gönan\" or \"Gönenlü\". The tribe was loosely based around Adana and Maraş.\n\nHistory\nAccording to Evliya Çelebi's Seyahatname (In which he collected the notes of his journeys), Gönen was used by the governors of Bursa as a summer holiday location, where they enjoyed the therapeutic uses of the hot springs.\n\nOn 18 March 1953, Gönen suffered a M7.3 earthquake which left 50 dead in Gönen and hundreds of buildings damaged.  a previous devastating earthquake had occurred here in 1440 AD.\n\nComposition\nThere are 101 neighbourhoods in Gönen District:\n\n 100.Yıl\n Akçaali\n Akçapınar\n Alacaoluk\n Alaettin\n Alaşar\n Altay\n Armutlu\n Asmalıdere\n Atıcıoba\n Ayvalıdere\n Babayaka\n Bakırlı\n Balcı\n Balcıdede\n Bayramiç\n Beyoluk\n Bostancı\n Buğdaylı\n Büyüksoğuklar\n Çakmak\n Çalıca\n Çalıoba\n Canbaz\n Çatak\n Çifteçeşmeler\n Çiftlikalanı\n Çığmış\n Çınarlı\n Çınarpınar\n Çobanhamidiye\n Dereköy\n Dişbudak\n Dumanalanı\n Ekşidere\n Fındıklı\n Gaybular\n Gebeçınar\n Gelgeç\n Geyikli\n Gökçesu\n Gündoğan\n Gündoğdu\n Güneşli\n Hacımenteş\n Hacıvelioba\n Hafızhüseyinbey\n Hasanbey\n Havutça\n Hodul\n Ilıcak\n Ilıcaoba\n İncirli\n Kalburcu\n Kalfaköy\n Kaplanobası\n Karaağaç Alanı\n Karalarçiftliği\n Karasukabaklar\n Karşıyaka\n Kavakalanı\n Kavakoba\n Keçeler\n Killik\n Kınalar\n Kocapınar\n Koçbayırı\n Körpeağaç\n Korudeğirmen\n Köteyli\n Küçüksoğuklar\n Kumköy\n Küpçıktı\n Kurtuluş\n Malkoç\n Muratlar\n Ömerler\n Ortaoba\n Osmanpazar\n Paşaçiftliği\n Pehlivanhoca\n Plevne\n Reşadiye\n Rüstem\n Saraçlar\n Sarıköy\n Şaroluk\n Sebepli\n Söğütköy\n Suçıktı\n Tahtalı\n Taştepe\n Tırnova\n Turplu\n Tütüncü \n Tuzakçı\n Üçpınar\n Ulukır\n Üzümlü\n Yeniakçapınar\n Yürükkeçidere\n\nTransport\n\nUsing available high speed ferry services, it takes 2 hours to reach Istanbul.

{"id": "4104429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easton%20Bavents", "title": "Easton Bavents", "text": "Easton Bavents is a hamlet and former civil parish, now in the parish of Reydon, in the East Suffolk district of the county of Suffolk, England. Once an important village with a market, it has been much eroded by the North Sea. A map of Suffolk dating from about 1610 shows it to have been the most easterly ecclesiastical parish in England. It is now confined to a stretch of the Suffolk coast to the east of Reydon. In 1961 the parish had a population of 23.\n\nHistory\nThe place-name Easton Bavents is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Estuna. It takes the form Eston Bavent in the Charter Rolls of 1330. The first part of the name means \"eastern settlement\". The Feudal Aids of 1316 show that the village was then held by Thomas de Bavent, Bavent being a place near Caen in Normandy.\n\nMedieval Easton Bavents was a parish of some importance, granted a weekly market in the 14th century, with a three-day fair on the feast day of St Nicholas of Myra (6 December). Records show the parish church, dedicated to St Nicholas, was still in use in 1639, and a rector appointed as late as 1666. However, the cliff on which the village was built collapsed. The church itself seems to have sunk under the sea in the latter part of the 17th century. A chapel dedicated to St Margaret the Virgin also disappeared.\n\nThe Battle of Solebay in the Third Anglo-Dutch War took place in 1672 off the coast of Easton Bavents, which survived as a fishing village until the 19th century. The continuing erosion of the cliffs makes the area a popular, albeit hazardous area for fossil hunters, who approach it along the beach from Southwold.\n\nThe pace of erosion has averaged some 3 metres a year since 1945, although storms and high tides increase the rate. The last three terraced houses on the cliff edge were demolished in January 2020. Author Juliet Blaxland wrote a memoir about living in one of them. Called The Easternmost House, it was published in 2019 and nominated for the Wainwright Prize. On 1 April 1987 the parish was abolished and merged with Reydon.\n\nResidual population\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nEaston Broad and Wood – Stacey Peak Media\n\nHamlets in Suffolk\nBeaches of Suffolk\nFormer civil parishes in Suffolk\nReydon"}

She is currently Professor Emeritus of English & Comparative Literature at the University of the Philippines Diliman and Director of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Center for Creative Writing and Literary Studies.\n\nAcademic career\nPantoja-Hidalgo is a high school valedictorian of St. Paul College Quezon City. She received both her Bachelor of Philosophy (Faculty of Philosophy and Letters) (1964) magna cum laude and MA in Literature (1967), meritissimus, from the University of Santo Tomas. She later received a PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of the Philippines Diliman in 1993. She is a member of the Philippine Literary Arts Council (PLAC).\n\nShe previously served as the Vice President for Public Affairs of the University of the Philippines System, Director of the University of the Philippines Press and coordinator of the Creative Writing Program at the Department of English and Comparative Literature of the University of the Philippines Diliman. At UST, Pantoja-Hidalgo held the post of UST Publishing House Director.\n\nBefore and after her fifteen years abroad, Hidalgo was a teacher first at the University of Santo Tomas and later at the University of the Philippines. Completing the requirements for her PhD in Comparative Literature, Hidalgo has found many opportunities to read Literary Theory as well as put these into practice in her own works. Hidalgo claimed that she had never considered herself a literary critic; but, just the same, she found it useful to collect five of her critical essays in A Gentle Subversion: Essays on Philippine Fiction in English (1998).\n\nLiterary career\nPantoja-Hidalgo has been writing for Philippine newspapers and magazines since the age of fifteen. She has worked as a writer, editor and teacher in Thailand, Lebanon, Korea, Myanmar (Burma) and New York, United States. Her interesting lifestyle, the result of her husband's fifteen-year connection with UNICEF, is reflected in her writing. Pantoja-Hidalgo was originally best known for an unusual kind of autobiographical/travel writing, which includes Sojourns (1984), Skyscrapers, Celadon and Kimchi (1993), I Remember (1991) and The Path of the Heart (1994), \"Passages: Travel Essays\" (2007), \"Looking for the Philippines\" (2009), and \"Travels With Tania\" (2009). Pantoja-Hidalgo later won numerous prizes for her fiction, creative nonfiction, literary scholarship and edited anthologies. She has frequently published many of her creative and critical manuscripts in major publications in Finland, Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and the United States.\n\nBesides travel essays, Hidalgo has published collections of personal essays, The Path of Heart (1994),Coming Home (1997) and \"Stella and Other Friendly Ghosts\" (2012). She has also edited several anthologies, like \"Creative Nonfiction: A Reader\" (2003, 2005), \"The Children's Hour\" (2007, 2008), \"Sleepless in Manila: Funny Essays, Etc. on Insomnia by Insomniacs\" (2003), \"My Fair Maladies: Funny Essays and Poems on Various Ailments and Afflictions\" (2005), and \"Tales of Fantasy and Enchantment\" (2008).\n\nShe has encouraged many aspiring writers' efforts by editing their works: Shaking the Family Tree (1998) and Why I Travel and Other Essays by Fourteen Women (2000) with Erlinda Panlilio. Hidalgo found the idea of writing short and simple initiation stories appealing. It reflects in her collection of short stories: Ballad of a Lost Season and Other Stories (1987), Tales for a Rainy Night (1993), Where Only the Moon Rages: Nine Tales (1994), Catch a Falling Star (1999) and the most recent one Sky Blue After The Rain: Selected Stories and Tales (2005).\n\nHidalgo's critical essays, which reflect her interest in fictional writing by Filipino women, serves a much-needed contribution to a developing body of feminist scholarship in the country today.\n\nNovel: Recuerdo\nRecuerdo is an epistolary novel which consists of messages sent through email. The messages are written by Amanda, a middle-aged widow, to her daughter Marisa, a university student. Amanda lives in Bangkok while Marisa is situated in Manila. Through these messages, Amanda manages to sort out her life and helps Marisa understand their family's past. Amanda often tells her own mother's (Isabel) stories in many of these letters.\n\nThis way of storytelling resulted to a \"Dynasty in Cyberspace\" against a backdrop that juxtaposes two entirely different cultures: the first being superstitious while the other sophisticated. The story aims in this way to provide readers a history with which to possibly relate to ---- as it discusses the complexity of life in a world where families share so much heritage and stories often unknown and untold.\n\nHidalgo espouses a particularly pragmatic stance on this particular novel. It is not rooted in realism nor does it have any attempt on realism ---- it is a romantic novel. Fellow writer Ophelia Dimalanta supports Hidalgo as she says in her review of \"Recuerdo\", that readers might have the tendency of commenting on \"the contravening of some degree of verisimilitude in the narrating of the stories rendered through letters which come regularly and with such contrived continuity and incessantness.\" Clearly, Dimalanta's response is a way of reinforcing Hidalgo's claim of \"Recuerdo\" being a romantic novel.\n\nNovel: A Book of Dreams\nA novel all about dreams and their respective dreamers.

People's Artist of the USSR (1979) and Hero of Socialist Labour (1985).\n\nBiography\nPavel Kadochnikov was born in Petrograd in 1915. In 1927, he entered a children's artistic studio, dreaming to become a professional artist, but, because of the severe illness of his father, Pavel, as the elder in the family, was forced to become the apprentice to a metal craftsman. However, he continued to study in the studio. In 1929, he entered the actor's department of theatrical school of TYuZ. In 1935, he graduated from Leningrad Theatrical Institute and until 1944 was an actor in Leningrad's New TYuZ.\n\nHe began to act in the cinema in 1935. His first role was Mikhas in the film Maturity. Kadochnikov was not pleased the way he looked on the screen in his early roles, and he decided to never play in the cinema again. He did not stand by this decision. In 1937, he accepted Sergei Yutkevich's invitation and appeared in a minor role in the film The Man with the Gun. In many plays he performed several roles; in one of them he performed at once eight roles. In 1940, he played the roles of worker Lenka Sukhov and writer Maxim Gorky in the film Yakov Sverdlov directed by Sergei Yutkevich. In Ivan the Terrible by Sergei Eisenstein he not only conducted the tragic line of the pretender Vladimir of Staritsa, but also played two small roles (of Chaldean and Yevstafy).\n\nHis actor's range can be seen in his lyric roles (Anton Ivanovich is Angry, The Tamer of Tigers) and in the role of Major Fedotov in the Secret Agent by Boris Barnet. The role of Major Fedotov was a cult character of Soviet cinema which mixed the pathetics, manly charm and irony. For the roles he took in the patriotic movies he won the Stalin Prize (in 1948 for the Secret Agent, in 1949 for the role of Aleksey Maresyev in the Tale of a True Man, in 1951 for the role of Kovshov in the film Far from Moscow). Time and again actor appeared in the role of Maxim Gorky. From the 1960s onwards, he began to move away from patriotic roles.\n\nIn 1965 Kadochnikov directed his first film Musicians of One Regiment together with Gennadi Kazansky. This film is about the Civil War. It showed his interest in folklore heroes. In 1968 he filmed the fairy tale of Alexander Ostrovsky, titled The Snow Maiden (he also played the role of Berendey). In 1970-1980s, he did roles from the classical repertoire: Triletsky in the An Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano, Prince Kuchumov in Easy Money, and the picturesque figures of \"Russian old men\" (eternal grandfather in Siberiade and uncle Roman in The Seagulls Did Not Fly Here). In Lenin in Paris he plays Paul Lafargue. In later years he played in the character roles (Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Last Visit); staged films I Shall Never Forget (about the fate of Soviet soldier and his wife, separated by war) and Silver Strings (about the Russian virtuoso balalaika-player Vasily Andreyev).\n\nHis granddaughter is Danish-born actress, singer, songwriter and model Nina Bergman.\n\nFilmography\n\nAs actor\n\n Yakov Sverdlov (1940) as Maxim Gorky\n Anton Ivanovich Is Angry (1941) as Aleksey Petrovich Mukhin\n Fortress on the Volga (1942, part 1, 2) as Rudnev\n Ivan the Terrible (1944) as Vladimir Andreyevich Staritsky\n Hello Moscow!

This interpretation of the agreement would mean less power than the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) had anticipated for its leader, Raila Odinga, who was expected to become Prime Minister under the deal; the ODM angrily rejected Muthaura's interpretation.\n\nMuthaura has been named as an instigator of post-election violence in 2007 – 2008 and was named among six suspects to be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court. He was accused of leading secret meetings in Kibaki's office, where revenge attacks against supporters of Kibaki's opposition were planned. The ICC prosecutor claimed he authorised the use of excessive force against protesters by the police. He was taped by two people posing as students, who claimed he had admitted involvement in post-election violence.

Operating during the Second World War, the three boats of the class comprised ,  and . All the submarines were named after rivers in the United Kingdom. One was lost during the war and the rest taken out of service following it.\n\nDesign\nThe River class was the last attempt by the Admiralty to produce \"fleet submarines\", submarines fast enough to operate as part of a fleet, which at the time meant being able to manage somewhere around  while surfaced. The previous attempts had been the steam powered K-class submarines and the large  gunned M-class submarines. The M class were K-class hulls re-engined with diesels and modified to take a single  naval gun directly forward of the conning tower.\n\nA design was drawn up in the late 1920s and three vessels were built by Vickers in Barrow: Thames in 1932, and Severn and Clyde in 1935. The latter two were a little larger than Thames. Initially 20 were planned, but changes in thinking and cost-cuts limited the building to just the three.\n\nThe design compromised on diving depth to keep weight down and speed up. They had a safe diving depth of some  compared to the  before them which had managed . They were powered by two diesel engines delivering . Two Ricardo engines drove generators that supercharged the diesels up to . This gave them a surface speed of . A rather unfortunate fault with the River-class was a tendency for engine trouble after several long journeys. Another alarming fault, although this was confined to Clyde was the hydroplanes failing, causing the submarine to bottom. This would put a great stress on the hull of the submarine, as it was of riveted construction, rather than the welded construction of other British submarines.\n\nOperational history\nDuring the Second World War, they initially operated in the North Sea and Mediterranean, then moved to the Far East in the latter stages.\n\nClyde and Severn set sail from Gibraltar heading to take up station in Freetown on 31 August 1939, just four days before the outbreak of hostilities. On their arrival, they joined South Atlantic Command and were tasked with convoy defence duties. They arrived on September 7, with Clyde departing on her first war patrol the following day.\n\nThames was lost off Norway on 23 September 1940 during an operation to sink the German Battlecruiser Gneisenau. It failed to do this, but sank the escorting torpedo boat Luchs. The wreck of the Thames is yet to be found. When it is discovered, it is highly likely that it is to be left alone, because like all ships lost in wartime, it is considered to be a war grave.\n\nClyde was used on six occasions to deliver supplies to the besieged island of Malta in September 1941. Severn was used as part of the escort for Convoy SL16F in January 1940, along with the Armed Merchant Cruiser HMS Cheshire and the destroyers HMS Hardy and HMS Hostile. Convoy duty was not something that was alien to Severn and Clyde, as they would carry out this duty on a regular basis due to their long range. Clyde and Severn would both go through an extensive refit in the USA\n\nSevern had the most colourful service out of all three. It would be used in the aftermath of the Battle of the River Plate to hunt for German Surface Raiders and their support ships. April 5, 1940 would see Severn join the northbound convoy FN139. It would also be put on standby for potential involvement in the hunt for the Bismarck, but the Bismarck was sunk before the Severn was called into action. It would be used for part of Operation Hawthorn during June - July 1943. Severn and Clyde , whether it was by choice or accident, would often be stationed together. Severn and Clyde were in service in the Far East (operating out of Trincomalee) when they were taken out of service - Severn in December 1944 and Clyde in July 1945. Both ships were believed to have been scrapped by the end of 1946.\n\nBoats\n\n  - accounted for 1 enemy vessel\n  - accounted for 4 enemy vessels\n  - accounted for 6 enemy vessels\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922–1946\n D.K.

He was a founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change and at the time of his death was the Vice-President of the faction of the Movement for Democratic Change led by Arthur Mutambara. A former president of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, he was first elected to the House of Assembly in the 2000 parliamentary election. He was a member of the Senate and a Minister of State in the Office of Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara at the time of his death in 2010.\n\nEarly life\n\nSibanda was born in Filabusi, Matabeleland South. He went to school at Thekwane High School near Bulawayo in Matabeleland. He was classmates with Paul Tangi Mhova Mkondo and he was taught by Canaan Banana and Edson Zvobgo. He then worked on the Rhodesia railways (National Railways of Zimbabwe after 1980) and was a trade unionist before going into politics as Welfare Secretary of ZAPU (being jailed by the Rhodesian government from 1976 to 1979. After independence in 1980 he continued his work as a train driver at the NRZ. During his time at the NRZ he was active in the trade union and became the ZCTU president. At the same time he was promoted to Running Shed Foreman at the NRZ by the time he won the 2000 parliamentary elections as an MP for Nkulumane constituency.\n\nIn 1984 Sibanda was elected President of five amalgamated railway trades unions. He studied and obtained a Diploma in Industrial Labour Relations, and was the first Vice-President of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions in 1988 before serving as President from 1989. He was a leading member of the initiative for the ZCTU to establish a political party in 2000, being unanimously elected as Vice-President at the inaugural congress.\n\nMDC activity\nSibanda was elected to the House of Assembly from Nkulumane in the 2000 election, defeating ZANU-PF candidate Dumiso Dabengwa.\n\nIn 2005, Sibanda was the leader of a faction within the MDC which advocated that the party should participate in elections to the Senate of Zimbabwe, which it had opposed. When the MDC National Council voted to support participation, MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai suspended Sibanda and his supporters, such as Welshman Ncube, pending a Congress in February 2006. They accused Tsvangirai of being dictatorial and said that they had actually suspended him.\n\nThe MDC split in October 2005, a result of escalating internal tensions which saw Tsvangirai differ sharply with some of his senior colleagues on various policy issues, including election participation.\n\nSibanda was elected to the Senate in the March 2008 parliamentary election. He stood as a candidate for the post of President of the Senate on 25 August 2008, and he was backed by both MDC factions, but was defeated by ZANU-PF candidate Edna Madzongwe, receiving 28 votes against 58 votes for Madzongwe.\n\nDeath\nSibanda died in 2010 after a battle with cancer and was the first member of the opposition to be declared a national hero by both MDC parties, but their plea for Gibson Sibanda to be buried at the Heroes Acre was denied by President Robert Mugabe.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBiography on Zimbabwe Parliament Website\n\n1944 births\n2010 deaths\nMembers of the Senate of Zimbabwe\nMembers of the National Assembly of Zimbabwe\nMovement for Democratic Change – Mutambara politicians\nDeaths from cancer\nPeople from Matabeleland South Province\nNorthern Ndebele people\nZimbabwean trade unionists\n20th-century Zimbabwean politicians\n21st-century Zimbabwean politicians"}

{"id": "4104491", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slater%20Mill", "title": "Slater Mill", "text": "The Slater Mill is a historic water-powered textile mill complex on the banks of the Blackstone River in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, modeled after cotton spinning mills first established in England. It is the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in America to utilize the Arkwright system of cotton spinning as developed by Richard Arkwright.\n\nThe mill's founder Samuel Slater apprenticed as a young man with industrialist Jedediah Strutt in Belper, England. Shortly after emigrating to the United States, Slater was hired by Moses Brown of Providence, Rhode Island to produce a working set of machines necessary to spin cotton yarn using water power. Construction of the machines was completed in 1793, as well as a dam, waterway, waterwheel, and mill. Manufacturing was based on Arkwright's cotton spinning system, which included carding, drawing, and spinning machines. Slater initially hired children and families to work in his mill, establishing a pattern that was replicated throughout the Blackstone Valley and known as the \"Rhode Island System\". It was later eclipsed by Francis Cabot Lowell's Waltham System. The mill and surrounding area were the site of early labor resistance, including the first factory strike in the United States, which was led by young women workers in 1824. \n\nSlater Mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966, the first property to be listed on the register. In December 2014, the mill was added to the newly formed Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.\n\nArchitectural history\n\nThe original portion of the Slater Mill built in 1793 was six bays long and two stories tall. Several additions were made beginning in 1801, and a second added in 1835. Between 1869 and 1872, a large addition was made to the north end of the mill. Cotton spinning continued until 1895, after which the mill was used for various industrial purposes until 1923. The building had suffered numerous fires in the past, and two fires occurred in 1912 which precipitated awareness of the building and the need for its preservation.\n\nFrom mill to museum\nIn 1921, the non-profit Old Slater Mill Association was founded with the purpose of saving the historic Mill. Efforts to restore the mill began in 1923; modern additions to the structure were removed, restoring the mill to its 1835 appearance. In 1955, it opened as a museum. Restoration of the nearby Wilkinson Mill (built 1810–1811) was completed in 1978 as part of the Slater Mill site.\n\nThe Slater Mill site now serves as a museum, educational center, and music venue, which \"celebrates innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit by engaging audiences in relevant cultural, historic, and artistic endeavors\". It includes five acres of land on both sides of the Blackstone River, a dam on the river, two historic mills (the Slater Mill and Wilkinson Mill), and the Sylvanus Brown House (built in 1758 but moved to the site in the 1960s).\n\nThe Slater Mill and other key buildings that are part of the Old Slater Mill Historic District were acquired by the National Park Service in 2021.\n\nSee also\n\nHannah Slater\nSamuel Slater\nDavid Wilkinson\nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor\nDerwent Valley Mills\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Pawtucket, Rhode Island\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Rhode Island\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nProvidence Journal video of Slater Mill Historic Site\nProvidence Journal video of the Blackstone River\nSite about Slater and his mill\nPawtucket Arts Festival\n\n1793 establishments in Rhode Island\nBuildings and structures in Pawtucket, Rhode Island\nCotton mills in the United States\nHistoric American Buildings Survey in Rhode Island\nHistoric American Engineering Record in Rhode Island\nHistory of the textile industry\nIndustrial archaeological sites in the United States\nIndustrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island\nIndustrial buildings completed in 1793\nIndustrial Revolution\nIndustry museums in Rhode Island\nMill museums in the United States\nMuseums established in 1955\nMuseums in Providence County, Rhode Island\nNational Historic Landmarks in Rhode Island\nNational Register of Historic Places in Pawtucket, Rhode Island\nTextile machinery manufacturers\nTextile museums in Rhode Island\nTourist attractions in Pawtucket, Rhode Island\n1955 establishments in Rhode Island\nBlackstone River Valley National Historical Park"}
{"id": "4104496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy%27s%20Boots", "title": "Billy's Boots", "text": "Billy's Boots was a popular British comic strip by writer Fred Baker and artist John Gillatt, later continued by Mike Western. The original Billy's Boots was an earlier humorous series, written and drawn by Frank Purcell, which appeared in Tiger from December 23rd 1961 until July 13th 1963, with a similar premise to this later series. The later more serious Billy appeared in the first issue of Scorcher in 1970, and later moved to Tiger when the two comics merged in 1974. In 1985, Tiger in turn merged with Eagle and the strip moved again. Just a year later, Billy's adventures relocated once more, this time to Roy of the Rovers. New adventures were included in the weekly comic until May 1990 (later followed by reprints), before he switched to Best of Roy of the Rovers Monthly. The strip also appeared in annuals, including annuals for comics which had themselves ceased publication. The strip is still fondly remembered by fans of the \"golden age\" of British boys' comics. In Finland and Sweden, Billy's Boots was published in Buster magazine. In the UK, stories based on Billy's earliest adventures appeared in Total Football magazine until it closed in 2001, and Billy's story was also reprinted for a few months in the defunct Striker comic.\n\nStory overview\n\nThe series concerned Billy Dane, a schoolboy and aspiring footballer, who was an extremely poor player until he discovered a pair of old style, ankle high, football boots while cleaning his grandmother's loft. The boots, which his grandfather had bought as a souvenir, had belonged, decades before, to a famous professional striker called Charles \"Dead Shot\" Keen. In a manner which was never explained in the story, the boots possess special abilities which turn Billy into a fantastic football player when he wore them. In addition to giving Billy the physical skill to score great goals, the boots also granted him the intuition to be in the right place at the time on the pitch, leading him to feel that they have a \"mind of their own\".\n\nEach week, the strip was introduced with the words, \"Billy Dane found an ancient pair of football boots that used to belong to old-time soccer star, \"Dead-Shot\" Keen. In some strange way, the boots enabled Billy to play in the same style as Dead Shot...\"\n\nHowever, despite the boots' obvious importance to him, he would repeatedly lose them or have them stolen.\n\nThe boots fell apart after a few matches due to their age and could not be repaired. Fearing that he would lose his new-found ability and knowing that \"Dead Shot\" Keen had played for the local club, Amhurst Albion, Billy went to their ground to see if any of Keen's other boots remained there. Having secretly entered the stadium, he found the boot room and discovered another pair of Keen's old boots which, much repaired, he used for the remainder of the story.\n\nThe boots endowed Billy with sufficient ability to make regular appearances in schoolboy representative matches, appearing for Southern Schools against their Western, Northern and Eastern counterparts, and the full England Schoolboys team, with whom he travelled on tours to France and Germany.\n\nIn 1971, while playing for England in one such tour match in France, the boots split and Billy took them to a local shoe repairer's shop. When he went to collect them, the elderly owner told Billy that he recognised the boots as a pair he had made as a special order for Keen many years earlier. Billy asked him to make an identical pair, as a contingency against future damage or loss of the original boots. When Billy wore the new boots in his school's next match, they did not enable Billy to play in Keen's style, and he missed a penalty, so he had to revert to the original pair at half time with the consequent restoration of his abilities.\n\nBilly was often able to anticipate future events in his own life by reading Keen's book The Life of Dead Shot Keen. Billy's life often mirrored Keen's, such as the time when he came on as a substitute in a school match with his team losing 0-7, and scored 8 goals himself to win the match, or when he accidentally got into trouble by being selected for both sides in a schools' cup final. He had previously read about Keen's similar experiences while turning out for his teams. He was thus able to foresee events and work out solutions to problems.\n\nIn February 1971 Billy sat his 11+. Despite his gran forbidding him to play football so he could concentrate on his schoolwork, he failed to qualify for the Grammar School, but achieved a good enough grade to attend the local Secondary School, Kenwood Technical.\n\nBilly lived with his grandmother, but the fate of his parents was only addressed very briefly early on when a teacher offered him a lift to a match if his dad couldn't take him. Billy replied, \"M-My dad's n-not alive, sir\". In 1973 Billy and his grandmother moved to the village of Groundwood to live with his grandmother's elderly sister Kate, who owned a large house there.\n\nBy the early 1980s, Billy was playing as centre forward for Groundwood School, alongside pals such as Jimmy Dawson, Reg Wood, Marvin Soames and Harvey Crisp. The strip regularly involved mishaps involving his boots, which were periodically lost, stolen or damaged, resulting in Billy underperforming and thus being dropped from the school team. In several instances, he turned out for opposing sides such as \"Merlin\" or \"Brand X\", scoring against the school first team, thus embarrassing the sports teacher, Mr Harris.\n\nDuring the strip's run in Eagle, the football element of the story was downplayed somewhat, focusing instead on Billy's exploits whilst on the run from a council home where he had been placed when his grandmother (with whom he lived) had been taken ill. There would often be no football action for several weeks, which was odd given that the central premise of the strip was football-based. When the strip moved to Roy of the Rovers, football once again became the central element in the strip.

Its population is 10,657 (2022). The mayor is Nami Çiftçi (MHP).\n\nHistory\n\nToponymy \nThe current name Gürün is most probably a corruption of the ancient name Tegarama, a city in Anatolia during the Bronze Age. In Armenian, the town is known as Gurin or Gyurin (). In Kurdish the locality is known as Girîn.\n\nAncient history \nThe city was inhabited during the Old Assyrian Kingdom and Hittite Empire. Ancient rock caves dating to 2000 BC are located in the district. The caves would have been in use, possibly as a kind of apartment complex, during the Hittite period. The caves were also \"used as a cold storage area, woodshed and animal feed storage area by local people until a short time ago\", and are now open to visitors. Nami Çiftçi, the town's mayor, told Daily Sabah that they \"don't have a precise date determined by expert engineers or by people who are well-versed in this field, so I invite our historians to Gürün. Come, bring your knowledge and your tools, study these caves so that we can have the data regarding their age, and we can announce it to the world\".\n\nModern history \nDuring the Armenian Genocide, a sizable portion of the city's Armenian population was deported and killed. According to the memoir Goodbye, Antoura, during the pre-genocide years the Armenian population had achieved a level of stability in Gürün, with at least one Armenian family owning large swathes of land and orchards. In 1915, the Ottoman government appropriated these lands, and the Armenian population was deported southward and westward into the Syrian desert, eventually reaching the cities of Homs and Hama. \n\nA student association of Armenians from Gürün was founded in Boston in 1899, which later became the Compatriotic Union of Gurin. The union's initial purpose was to assist survivors of the genocide and their families, and it established chapters across the world. The compatriotic union published two periodicals, one from 1930 to 1933 in New York and another from 1976 to 1981 in New Jersey, as well as a book titled Badmakirk' Gurini (\"History Book of Gurin\", 1974, Beirut). The union cooperated with Armenians from Gürün in Yerevan to found the village of Nor Kyurin in Soviet Armenia. The organization was dissolved in the late 20th century, as the last Armenians born in Gürün died of old age.\n\nIn September 2018, it was announced that a dilapidated Armenian church in Gürün would be renovated.\n\nDemographics\nIn his Seyahatname, Evliya Çelebi claimed that the town's population then was wholly made up of Turkomans. In 1914, there were 13,874 Armenians living in the kaza of Gürün, which contained five villages that were exclusively Armenian and a few scattered settlements. Gürün, the kaza's seat, had 12,168 residents, 8,406 of whom were Armenian.\n\nNotable people \n Antranig Dzarugian (1913–1989), Armenian writer, poet, educator and journalist\n Haroutiun Galentz (1910–1967), Armenian painter\n Abdüllatif Şener (born 1954), Turkish politician\n Mustafa Karasu (born 1950), a deputy chairman of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)\n Vahe Vahian (1909–1998), Armenian poet, writer, editor, pedagogue and orator\n İsmet Yılmaz (born 1961), Turkish politician\n Cem Yılmaz  (born 1973), Turkish comedian\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n World Surface - Gürün, Turkey\n Luc Vartan Baronian - The Former Armenian Community of Gurin\n\nFurther reading\n Panian, Karnig.

{"id": "4104602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1795%E2%80%931820%20in%20Western%20fashion", "title": "1795–1820 in Western fashion", "text": "Fashion in the period 1795–1820 in European and European-influenced countries saw the final triumph of undress or informal styles over the brocades, lace, periwigs and powder of the earlier 18th century. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, no one wanted to appear to be a member of the French aristocracy, and people began using clothing more as a form of individual expression of the true self than as a pure indication of social status. As a result, the shifts that occurred in fashion at the turn of the 19th century granted the opportunity to present new public identities that also provided insights into their private selves. Katherine Aaslestad indicates how \"fashion, embodying new social values, emerged as a key site of confrontation between tradition and change.\"\n\nFor women's dress, the day-to-day outfit of the skirt and jacket style were practical and tactful, recalling the working-class woman. Women's fashions followed classical ideals, and stiffly boned stays were abandoned in favor of softer, less boned corsets. This natural figure was emphasized by being able to see the body beneath the clothing. Visible breasts were part of this classical look, and some characterized the breasts in fashion as solely aesthetic and sexual.\n\nThis era of British history is known as the Regency period, marked by the regency between the reigns of George III and George IV. But the broadest definition of the period, characterized by trends in fashion, architecture, culture, and politics, begins with the French Revolution of 1789 and ends with Queen Victoria's 1837 accession. The names of popular people who lived in this time are still famous: Napoleon and Josephine, Juliette Récamier, Jane Austen, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, Beau Brummell, Lady Emma Hamilton, Queen Louise of Prussia and her husband and many more. Beau Brummell introduced trousers, perfect tailoring, and unadorned, immaculate linen as the ideals of men's fashion.\n\nIn Germany, republican city-states relinquished their traditional, modest, and practical garments and started to embrace the French and English fashion trends of short-sleeved chemise dresses and Spencer jackets. American fashion trends emulated French dress, but in a toned-down manner, with shawls and tunics to cope with the sheerness of the chemise. Spanish majos, however, rebelled against foppish French Enlightenment ideals by reclaiming and elaborating upon traditional Spanish dress.\n\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, a major shift in fashion was taking place that extended beyond changes in mere style to changes in philosophical and social ideals. Prior to this time, the style and traditions of the Ancien Régime prevented the conceptualization of \"the self\". Instead, one's identity was considered malleable; subject to change depending on what clothes one was wearing. However, by the 1780s, the new, \"natural\" style allowed one's inner self to transcend their clothes.\n\nDuring the 1790s, there was a new concept of the internal and external self. Before this time, there had only been one self, which was expressed through clothing. When going to a masquerade ball, people wore specific clothing, so they could not show their individuality through their clothing. Incorporated in this new \"natural\" style was the importance of ease and comfort of one's dress. Not only was there a new emphasis on hygiene, but also clothing became much lighter and more able to be changed and washed frequently. Even upper-class women began wearing cropped dresses as opposed to dresses with long trains or hoops that restricted them from leaving their homes. The subsequent near stasis of the silhouette inspired volumes of new trims and details on heavily trimmed skirts back into fashion. In the Regency years, complicated historic and orientalist elements provided lavish stylistic displays as such details were a vigorous vehicle for conspicuous consumption given their labor-intensive fabrications, and therefore a potent signifier of hierarchy for the upper classes who wore the styles. This kind of statement was particularly noticeable in profuse trimmings, especially on skirts where unrestrained details were common, along with cut edge details and edge trims.\n\nWomen's fashion was also influenced by male fashion, such as tailored waistcoats and jackets to emphasize women's mobility. This new movement toward practicality of dress showed that dress became less of a way to solely categorize between classes or genders; dress was meant to suit one's personal daily routine. It was also during this time period that the fashion magazine and journal industry began to take off. They were most often monthly (often competing) periodicals that allowed men and women to keep up with the ever-changing styles.\n\nInfluence of the Industrial Revolution \n\nIn the late 18th century, clothes were mostly sold by individual shopkeepers who were often the artisans who made the goods. Customers usually lived in the same neighborhood as the shops and the shops would gain popularity by their customers' word-of–mouth recommendation, with the exception of warehouses (i.e., any retail on wholesale), where goods being sold were not necessarily made in the shop. However, things started to change during the transition to the 19th century. People sought efficiency and variety; under the influence of the Industrial Revolution, improved transportation and introduction of machines in manufacturing allowed fashion to develop at an even faster pace.\n\nThe first sewing machine emerged in 1790, and later, Josef Madersperger began developing his first sewing machine in 1807, presenting his first working machine in 1814. The introduction of the sewing machine sped up garment production. However, it had no widespread social impact until the 1840s, and clothing was entirely made by hand in the period to 1820. Meanwhile, advanced spinning, weaving and cotton-printing techniques developed in the 18th century had already brought cheaper, widely available washable fabrics. These durable and affordable fabrics became popular among the larger population. These techniques were further developed by the introduction of machines. Before, accessories like embroidery and lace were manufactured on a small and limited scale by skilled craftsmen and sold in their own shops; in 1804, a machine for embroidering was constructed by John Duncan, and people started producing these essential accessories in factories and dispatching the products to shops throughout the country. These technical developments in clothing production allowed a greater variety of styles; rapid changes in fashion also became possible.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution bridged Europe and America with regards to travel. When Louis Simond first arrived in America, he was struck by the mobility of the population and frequency of people made trips to the capital, writing \"you meet nowhere with those persons who never were out of their native place, and whose habits are wholly local — nobody above poverty\nwho has not visited London once in his life; and most of those who can, visit once a year.' New canals and railways not only transported people, but created national and even broader markets by transporting goods manufactured in factories at great distances. The rise of industry throughout the Western world increased garment production and people were encouraged to travel more widely and purchase more goods than ever before.\n\nCommunication was also improved in this era. New ideas about fashion were conveyed by little dolls dressed in the latest style, newspapers, and illustrated magazines; for example, La Belle Assemblée, founded by John Bell, was a British women's magazine published from 1806 to 1837.  It was known for its fashion plates of contemporary fashions, demonstrating ways for women to dress and create ensembles.\n\nChanges in fashion\n1790s:\nWomen: \"age of undress\"; dressing like statues coming to life; Greek fashion started to inspire the current fashion, and fillet-Greek classical hairstyles and high waisted clothing with a more triangular hem started to find its way; pastel fabrics; natural makeup; bare arms; blonde wigs; accessorized with: hats, Draped turban, gloves, jewelry, small handbags – reticules, shawls, handkerchiefs; parasols; fans; Maja: layered skirt\nMen: trousers with perfect tailoring; linen; coats cutaway in the front with long tails; cloaks; hats; the Dandy; Majo: short jacket\n\n1800s:\nWomen: short hair; white hats; trim, feathers, lace; Egyptian and Eastern influences in jewelry and apparel; shawls; hooded-overcoats; hair: masses of curls, sometimes pulled back into a bun\nMen: linen shirts w. high collars; tall hats; hair: short and wigless, à la Titus or Bedford Crop, but often with some long locks left coming down\n\n1810s:\nWomen: soft, subtle, sheer classical drapes; raised back waist of high-waisted dresses; short-fitted single-breasted jackets; morning dress; walking dress; evening dress; riding habits; bare bosoms and arms; hair: parted in the center, tight ringlets over the ears\nMen: fitted, single-breasted tailcoats; cravats wrapped up to the chin; sideburns and \"Brutus style\" natural hair; tight breeches; silk stockings; accessorized with: gold watches, cane, hats outside.\n\n1820s:\nWomen: dress waistlines began to drop; elaborate hem and neckline decoration; cone-shaped skirts; sleeves pinched\nMen: overcoats/greatcoats w. fur or velvet collars; the Garrick coat; Wellington boots; jockey boots\n\nWomen's fashion\n\nOverview\nIn this period, fashionable women's clothing styles were based on a high, under the bust waistline, only called the Empire silhouette in the 20th century — dresses were closely fitted to the torso just under the bust, falling loosely below. In different contexts, such styles are now commonly called \"Directoire style\" (referring to the Directory government of France during the second half of the 1790s), \"Empire style\" (referring to Napoleon's 1804–1814/1815 empire, and often also to his 1800–1804 \"consulate\"), or \"Regency\" (loosely used to refer to various periods between the 18th century and the Victorian). Empire silhouette and Directoire style were not used at the time these styles were worn.\n\nThese 1795–1820 fashions were quite different from the styles prevalent during most of the 18th century and the rest of the 19th century when women's clothes were generally tight against the torso from the natural waist upwards, and heavily full-skirted below (often inflated by means of hoop skirts, crinolines, panniers, bustles, etc.). Women's fashion around this time started to follow classical ideals, inspired by the ancient Greek and Roman style with its gracious, loosely falling dresses that were gathered or just accentuated over the natural waist under the bust. For women, heavily boned stays  gave way to a celebration of the natural form. Bodices were short with waistlines falling just below the bust. Fashion fabrics such as cotton muslin were light to the point of being sheer, however, printed heavier cottons, wools and other textiles were also popular.\n\nGowns\n\nInspired by neoclassical tastes, 'undress' was the style of the day, casual and informal. It was the type of gown a woman wore from morning until noon or later depending on her social engagements of the day. The short-waisted dresses sported soft, loose skirts and were often made of white, almost transparent muslin, which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues. Since the fabric clung to the body, revealing what was underneath, it made nudity à la grecque a centerpiece of public spectacle. Satin was sometimes worn for evening wear. 'Half Dress' is thought of as how one would dress when going out during the day or meeting with guests.' Full Dress' was what a lady wore to formal events, day or night. 'Evening Dress' was only appropriate at evening affairs. Thus during the 1795–1820 period, it was often possible for middle- and upper-class women to wear clothes that were not very confining or cumbersome, and still be considered decently and fashionably dressed.\n\nAmong middle- and upper-class women there was a basic distinction between morning dress (worn at home in the afternoons as well as mornings) and evening attire — generally, both men and women changed clothes in preparation for the evening meal and possible entertainments to follow. There were also further gradations such as afternoon dress, walking dress, riding habits, traveling dress, dinner dress, etc.\n\nIn the Mirror of Graces; or the English Lady's Costume, published in London in 1811, the author (\"a Lady of Distinction\") advised:\n\n Mourning dresses were worn to show the mourning of a loved one. They were high-necked and long-sleeved, covering throat and wrists, generally plain and black, and devoid of decoration.\n Gowns (now restricted to formal occasions) were often extravagantly trimmed and decorated with lace, ribbons, and netting. They were cut low and sported short sleeves, baring bosoms. Bared arms were covered by long white gloves. Our Lady of Distinction, however, cautions young women from displaying their bosoms beyond the boundaries of decency, saying, \"The bosom and shoulders of a very young and fair girl may be displayed without exciting much displeasure or disgust.\"\n\nA Lady of Distinction also advised young ladies to wear softer shades of color, such as pinks, periwinkle blue, or lilacs. The mature matron could wear fuller colors, such as purple, black, crimson, deep blue, or yellow.\n\nMany women of this era remarked upon how being fully dressed meant the bosom and shoulders were bare, and yet being under-dressed would mean one's neckline went right up to one's chin.\n\nSilhouette \nDue to the importance of showing social status, the fashion industry was very much influenced by society during the Regency era. One's position was determined by the person's wealth, etiquette, family status, intelligence, and beauty. Women financially and socially relied on their husbands. The only socially-acceptable activities in which women could participate centered around social gatherings and fashion, the most important component of which was attending evening parties. These parties helped to build relationships and connection with others. As etiquette dictated different standards of attire for different events, afternoon dress, evening dress, evening full dress, ball dress, and different types of dresses were popular.\n\nWomen's fashion in the Regency era started to change drastically. It popularized the empire silhouette, which featured a fitted bodice and high waist. This \"new natural style\" emphasized the beauty of the body's natural lines. Clothing became lighter and easier to care for than in the past. Women often wore several layers of clothing, typically undergarments, gowns, and outerwear. The chemise, the standard undergarment of the era, prevented the thin, gauzy dresses from being fully transparent. Outerwear, such as the spencer and the pelisse, were popular.\n\nThe empire silhouette was created in the late 18th century to about the early 19th century and referred to the period of the First French Empire. This adoption had been linked with France's neoclassical taste for Greek principles. In fact, however, its genealogy is much more complex. It was first worn by the French queen, whose reference was Caribbean, not Greek. The style was often worn in white to denote as high social status. Josephine Bonaparte was one of the figureheads for the Empire waistline, with her elaborated and decorated Empire line dresses. Regency women followed the Empire style along with the same trend of raised waistlines as French styles, even when their countries were at war. Starting from the 1780s and early 1790s, women's silhouette became slimmer and the waistlines crept up. After 1795, waistlines rose dramatically and the skirt circumference was further reduced. A few years later, England and France started to show the focus of the high waist style and this led to the creation of Empire style.\n\nThe style began as part of Neoclassical fashion, reviving styles from Greco-Roman art which showed women wearing loose-fitting rectangular tunics known as peplos which were belted under the bust, providing support for women and a cool, comfortable outfit especially in a warm climate. The empire silhouette was defined by the waistline, which was positioned directly under the bust. The Empire silhouette was the key style in women's clothing during the Regency era. The dresses were usually light, long, and fit loosely, they were usually in white and often sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice which strongly emphasized thin hem and tied around the body. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather and was apparently lain around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favored. The dresses had a fitted bodice and it gave a high-waist appearance.\n\nThe style had waxed and waned in fashion for hundreds of years. The shape of the dresses also helped to lengthen the body's appearance. The clothing can also be draped to maximize the bust. Lightweight fabrics were typically used to create a flowing effect. Also, ribbon, sash, and other decorative features were used to highlight the waistline. The empire gowns were often with a low neckline and short sleeves and women usually wore them as for formal occasions. On the other hand, day dresses had a higher neckline and long sleeves. The chemisette was a staple for fashionable ladies. Although there were now differences between dresses and gowns, the high waistline was not changed.\n\nHairstyles and headgear\n\nDuring this period, the classical influence extended to hairstyles. Often masses of curls were worn over the forehead and ears, with the longer back hair drawn up into loose buns or Psyche knots influenced by Greek and Roman styles. By the later 1810s, front hair was parted in the center and worn in tight ringlets over the ears. Adventurous women like Lady Caroline Lamb wore short cropped hairstyles \"à la Titus\", the Journal de Paris reporting in 1802 that \"more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig à la Titus\", a layered cut usually with some tresses hanging down.\n\nIn the Mirror of Graces, a Lady of Distinction writes,\n\nConservative married women continued to wear linen mob caps, which now had wider brims at the sides to cover the ears. Fashionable women wore similar caps for morning (at home undress) wear.\n\nFor the first time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or bonnet, previously something often associated with prostitutes. However, most women continued to wear something on their head outdoors, though they were beginning to cease to do so indoors during the day (as well as for evening wear). The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary coif, Chinese hat, Oriental-inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons. In fact, ladies of the day embellished their hats frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.\n\nUndergarments\n\nFashionable women of the Regency era wore several layers of undergarments. The first was the chemise, or shift, a thin garment with tight, short sleeves (and a low neckline if worn under evening wear), made of white cotton and finished with a plain hem that was shorter than the dress. These shifts were meant to protect the outer-clothes from perspiration and were washed more frequently than outer clothes. In fact, washerwomen of the time used coarse soap when scrubbing these garments, then plunged them in boiling water, hence the absence of color, lace, or other embellishments, which would have faded or damaged the fabric under such rough treatment. Chemises and shifts also prevented the transparent muslin or silk dresses from being too revealing.\n\nThe next layer was a pair of stays or corset (more lightly boned). While high-waisted classical fashions required no corset for the slight of figure, most ordinary women still wore some kind of bust support, although the aim was to look as if they were not. The disappearance of the corset or stays has been much exaggerated by writers on the Regency period. There were some experiments to produce garments which would serve the same functions as a modern brassiere. (In the Mirror of Graces, a \"divorce\" was described as an undergarment that served to separate a woman's breasts. Made of steel or iron that was covered by a type of padding, and shaped like a triangle, this device was placed in the center of the chest.) \"Short stays\" (corsets extending only a short distance below the breasts) were often worn over the shift or chemise (not directly next to the skin), and \"long stays\" (corsets extending down towards the natural waist) were worn by women trying to appear slimmer than they were or who needed more support. The English wore these more than the French, but even such long stays were not primarily intended to constrict the waist, in the manner of Victorian corsets.\n\nThe final layer was the petticoat, which was the name for any skirt worn under the gown and could be a skirt with a bodice, a skirt attached over the torso by tapes, or a separate skirt. These petticoats were often worn between the underwear and the outer dress and were considered part of the outer clothing, not underwear. The lower edge of the petticoat was intended to be seen since women would often lift their outer dresses to spare the relatively delicate material of the outer dress from mud or damp (so exposing only the coarser and cheaper fabric of the petticoat to risk). Often exposed to view, petticoats were decorated at the hem with rows of tucks or lace, or ruffles.\n\n\"Drawers\" (large, flowy 'shorts' with buttons at the crotch) were only occasionally worn at this time. Women had no underwear under their dresses.\n\nStockings (hosiery), made of silk or knitted cotton, were held up by garters below the knee until suspenders were introduced in the late 19th century and were often of a white or pale flesh color.\n\nOuterwear and shoes\n\nDuring this time period, women's clothing was much thinner than in the eighteenth century so warmer outerwear became important in fashion, especially in colder climates. Coat-like garments such as pelisses and redingotes were popular, as were shawls, mantles, mantelets, capes, and cloaks. The mantelet was a short cape that was eventually lengthened and made into a shawl. The redingote, another popular example, was a full-length garment resembling a man's riding coat (hence the name) in style, that could be made of different fabrics and patterns. Throughout the period, the Indian shawl was the favored wrap, as houses and the typical English country house were generally draughty, and the sheer muslin and light silk dresses popular during this time provided less protection. Shawls were made of soft cashmere or silk or even muslin for summer. Paisley patterns were extremely popular at the time.\n\nShort (high-waisted) jackets called spencers were worn outdoors, along with long-hooded cloaks, Turkish wraps, mantles, capes, Roman tunics, chemisettes, and overcoats called pelisses (which were often sleeveless and reached down as far as the ankles). These outer garments were often made of double sarsnet, fine Merino cloth, or velvets, and trimmed with furs, such as swan's down, fox, chinchilla, or sable. On May 6, 1801, Jane Austen wrote her sister Cassandra, \"Black gauze cloaks are worn as much as anything.\"\n\nThin, flat fabric (silk or velvet), or leather slippers were generally worn (as opposed to the high-heeled shoes of much of the 18th century).\n\nMetal pattens were strapped on shoes to protect them from rain or mud, raising the feet an inch or so off the ground.\n\nAccessories\n\nGloves were always worn by women outside the house. When worn inside, as when making a social call, or on formal occasions, such as a ball, they were removed when dining. About the length of the glove, A Lady of Distinction writes:\n\nLonger gloves were worn rather loosely during this period, crumpling below the elbow. As described in the passage above, \"garters\" could fasten longer gloves.\n\nReticules held personal items, such as vinaigrettes. The form-fitting dresses or frocks of the day had no pockets, thus these small drawstring handbags were essential. These handbags were often called buskins or balantines. They were rectangular in shape and was worn suspended by a woven band from a belt placed around the figure above the waist.\n\nParasols (as shown in the illustration) protected a lady's skin from the sun and were considered an important fashion accessory. Slender and light in weight, they came in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes.\n\nFashionable ladies (and gentlemen) used fans to cool themselves and to enhance gestures and body language. Made of paper or silk on sticks of ivory and wood, and printed with oriental motifs or popular scenes of the era, these ubiquitous accessories featured a variety of shapes and styles, such as pleated or rigid. An information sheet from the Cheltenham Museum describes fans and their use in body language and communication (click and scroll to page 4).\n\nDirectoire (1795–1799)\n\nBy the mid-1790s, neoclassical clothing had come into fashion in France. Several influences had combined to bring about this simplification in women's clothing: aspects of Englishwomen's practical country outdoor-wear leaked up into French high fashion, and there was a reaction in revolutionary France against the stiffly boned corsets and brightly colored satins and other heavy fabrics that were in style in the Ancien Régime (see 1750–1795 in fashion). But ultimately, Neo-classicism was adopted for its association with classical republican ideas [with reference to Greece, rather than republican Rome, which was now considered politically dangerous]. This renewed fascination of the classical past was encouraged by the recent discoveries of Pompeii and Herculaneum, and would likely have not been possible outside such a specific geographic and historical setting that allowed the idea of the past made present to become paramount.\n\nAlong with the influences of the Pompeii and Herculaneum excavations, several other factors came together to popularize neoclassical dress. Starting in the early 1790s, Emma Hamilton began her performances of attitudes, something that was considered by contemporaries as entirely new. These attitudes were based loosely on the ancient practice of pantomime, though Emma's performances lacked masks and musical accompaniment. Her performances created a fusion between art and nature; art came alive and her body became a type of art. As an aid to her performances of tragic mythological and historical figures, Emma wore the clothing á la grecque that would become popular in mainstream France in the coming years. A simple light-colored chemise made from thin, flowing material was worn and gathered with a narrow ribbon under the breasts. Simple cashmere shawls were used as headdresses or to give more fullness to the drapery of the chemise. They also helped to prevent broken lines in the performance so that the outstretched arms were always connected with the body, escalating the effect of fluid movement, and oftentimes, a cape or a cloak was worn to emphasize the lines of the body in certain poses. This highlighted the continuity of surface of line and form in the body of the performer to emphasize the unity, simplicity, and continuously flowing movement from one part of the body to the next. The hair was worn in a natural, loose, and flowing fashion. All of these properties blended together to allow an extensive play of light and shadow to reveal and accent certain parts of the body during the performance while covering others. Emma was highly capable in her attitudes, and the influence of her dress spread from Naples to Paris as wealthy Parisians took the Grand Tour.\n\nThere is also some evidence that the white muslin shift dress became popular after Thermidor through the influence of prison dress. Revolutionary women such as Madame Tallien portrayed themselves in this way because it was the only clothing they possessed during their time in prison. The chemise á la grecque also represented the struggle for representation of the self and the stripping down of past cultural values. Also, a simplification of the attire worn by preteen girls in the 1780s (who were no longer required to wear miniature versions of adult stays and panniers) probably paved the way for the simplification of the attire worn by teenage girls and adult women in the 1790s. Waistlines became somewhat high by 1795, but skirts were still rather full, and neoclassical influences were not yet dominant.\n\nIt was during the second half of the 1790s that fashionable women in France began to adopt a thoroughgoing Classical style, based on an idealized version of ancient Greek and Roman dress (or what was thought at the time to be ancient Greek and Roman dress), with narrow clinging skirts. Some of the extreme Parisian versions of the neoclassical style (such as narrow straps which bared the shoulders, and diaphanous dresses without sufficient stays, petticoats, or shifts worn beneath) were not widely adopted elsewhere, but many features of the late-1790s neoclassical style were broadly influential, surviving in successively modified forms in European fashions over the next two decades.\n\nWith this Classical style came the willingness to expose the breast. With the new iconography of the Revolution as well as a change in emphasis on maternal breast-feeding, the chemise dress became a sign of the new egalitarian society. The style was simple and appropriate for the comfort of a pregnant or nursing woman as the breasts were emphasized and their availability was heightened. Maternity became fashionable and it was not uncommon for women to walk around with their breasts exposed. Some women took the \"fashionable maternity\" a step further and wore a \"six-month pad\" under their dress to appear pregnant.\n\nWhite was considered the most suitable color for neoclassical clothing (accessories were often in contrasting colors). Short trains trailing behind were common in dresses of the late 1790s.\n\nDirectoire gallery\n\nThis portrait of the Frankland sisters by John Hoppner gives an idea of the styles of 1795.\n\"Ruth entreating Naomi and Orpah to return to the land of Moab\" by William Blake. Blake is not a typical neo-classicist, but this shows a somewhat similar idealization of antiquity (as well as predicting the future high fashions of the late 1790s). The particular image was composed in 1795 and is currently held by the Fitzwilliam Museum.\nLeipzig fashion plate showing woman and girl wearing elegantly simple high-waisted styles, which are not strongly neoclassical, however.\nPortrait of Gabrielle Josephine du Pont.\n1798 picture, showing a lady who seems none too warmly attired for a balloon journey in her low-cut thin-looking Directoire dress.\nFashion plate of white Directoire dress worn with contrasting red shawl with a Greek key border.\nA 1798 sketch of a day outfit with short \"spencer\" jacket (less neoclassical, though still following the empire silhouette).\nMarie-Denise Villers wears an almost transparent white dress.\nGertrud Hage wears a white transparent dress over a white petticoat.\nRiding habits of 1799.

Dresses remained narrow in the front, but fullness at the raised back waist allowed room to walk. Colors other than white came into style, the fad for diaphanous outer fabrics faded (except in certain formal contexts), and some elements of obviously visible ornamentation came back into use in the design of the dress (as opposed to the elegant simplicity or subtle white-on-white embroidery of the dress of ca. 1800).\n\nEmpire gallery\n\nDolley Madison wears a short sleeved, light-pink dress with a high waistline.

This decline was especially evident in France due to the Emperor Napoleon's suppression of trade in the fabrics used in neoclassical dress. While waistlines were still high, they were beginning to drop slightly. Larger and more abundant decoration, especially near the hem and neckline foreshadowed greater extravagance in the coming years. More petticoats were being worn, and a stiffer, more cone-shaped skirt became popular. Stiffness could be supplemented by layers of ruffles and tucks on a hem, as well as corded or flounced petticoats. Sleeves began to be pulled, tied, and pinched in ways that were more influenced by romantic and gothic styles than neoclassical.

Instead, cut and tailoring became much more important as an indicator of quality. This transformation can be attributed in part to an increased interest in antiquity stemming from the discovery of classical engravings, including the Elgin Marbles. The figures depicted in classical art were viewed as an exemplar of the ideal natural form, and an embodiment of Neoclassical ideas. The style in London for men became more and more refined and this was due to the influence of two things: the dandy and the romantic movement. The dandy (a man who placed high importance on personal aesthetics and hobbies but wanted to seem totally nonchalant about it) arguably emerged as early as the 1790s. Dark colors were all but mandatory. (Dark doesn't necessarily mean dreary though; many items, particularly vests and coats were cut from rich, vivid fabrics.) Blue tailcoats with gold buttons were everywhere. White muslin shirts (sometimes with ruffles on the neck/sleeves) were extremely popular. Breeches were officially on their way out, with pants/trousers taking their place. Fabrics in general were becoming more practical silk and more wool, cotton, and buckskin. Therefore, in the 18th century, the dress was simplified and greater emphasis was put on tailoring to enhance the natural form of the body.\n\nThis was also the period of the rise of hair wax for styling men's hair, as well as mutton chops as a style of facial hair.\n\nBreeches became longer—tightly fitted leather riding breeches reached almost to the boot tops—and were replaced by pantaloons or trousers for fashionable streetwear. The French Revolution is largely responsible for altering the standard male dress. During the revolution, clothing symbolized the division between the upper classes and the working-class revolutionaries. French rebels earned the nickname sans-culottes, or \"the people without breeches,\" because of the loose floppy trousers they popularized.\n\nCoats were cutaway in front with long skirts or tails behind, and had tall standing collars. Lapels were not as large as they had been in years before and often featured an M-shaped notch unique to the period.\n\nShirts were made of linen, had attached collars, and were worn with stocks or wrapped in a cravat tied in various fashions. Pleated frills at the cuffs and the front opening went out of fashion by the end of the period.\n\nWaistcoats were high-waisted, and squared off at the bottom, but came in a broad variety of styles. They were often double-breasted, with wide lapels and stand collars. Around 1805 large lapels that overlapped those of the jacket began to fall out of fashion, as did the 18th-century tradition of wearing the coat unbuttoned, and gradually waistcoats became less visible. Shortly before this time waistcoats were commonly vertically striped but by 1810 plain white waistcoats were increasingly fashionable, as did horizontally striped waistcoats. High-collared waistcoats were fashionable until 1815, then collars were gradually lowered as the shawl collar came into use toward the end of this period.\n\nOvercoats or greatcoats were fashionable, often with contrasting collars of fur or velvet. The garrick, sometimes called a coachman's coat, was a particularly popular style, and had between three and five short caplets attached to the collar.\n\nBoots, typically Hessian boots with heart-shaped tops and tassels were a mainstay in men's footwear. After the Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, Wellington boots, as they were known, became the rage; tops were knee-high in front and cut lower in back. The jockey boot, with a turned-down cuff of lighter colored leather, had previously been popular but continued to be worn for riding. Court shoes with elevated heels became popular with the introduction of trousers.\n\nThe rise of the dandy\nThe clothes-obsessed dandy first appeared in the 1790s, both in London and Paris. In the slang of the time, a dandy was differentiated from a fop in that the dandy's dress was more refined and sober. The dandy prided himself in \"natural excellence\" and tailoring allowed for exaggeration of the natural figure beneath fashionable outerwear. \n \nIn High Society: A Social History of the Regency Period, 1788–1830, Venetia Murray writes:\n\nBeau Brummell set the fashion for dandyism in British society from the mid-1790s, which was characterized by immaculate personal cleanliness, immaculate linen shirts with high collars, perfectly tied cravats, and exquisitely tailored plain dark coats (contrasting in many respects with the \"maccaroni\" of the earlier 18th century).\n\nBrummell abandoned his wig and cut his hair short in a Roman fashion dubbed à la Brutus, echoing the fashion for all things classical seen in women's wear of this period. He also led the move from breeches to snugly tailored pantaloons or trousers, often light-colored for day and dark for the evening, based on working-class clothing adopted by all classes in France in the wake of the Revolution. In fact, Brummel's reputation for taste and refinement was such that, fifty years after his death, Max Beerbohm, wrote:\n\nNot every male aspiring to attain Brummel's sense of elegance and style succeeded, however, and these dandies were subject to caricature and ridicule. Venetia Murray quotes an excerpt from Diary of an Exquisite, from The Hermit in London, 1819:\n\nHairstyles and headgear\n\nThe French Revolution (1789-1799) in France and the Pitt's hair powder tax in 1795 in Britain effectively ended the fashion for both wigs and powder in these countries and younger men of fashion in both countries began to wear their own unpowdered hair without a queue in short curls, often with long sideburns. The new styles like the Brutus (\"à la Titus\") and the Bedford Crop became fashionable and subsequently spread also in other European and European-influenced countries including the United States. \n\nMany notable men during this period, especially younger ones, followed this new fashion trend of short unpowdered hairstyles, e.g. Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821), initially wearing long hair tied in a queue, changed his hairstyle and cut his hair short while in Egypt in 1798. Likewise the future U.S. President John Quincy Adams (1767-1848) who had worn a powdered wig and long hair tied in a queue in his youth, abandoned this fashion during this period while serving as the U.S. Minister to Russia (1809-1814) and later became the first president to adopt a short haircut instead of long hair tied in a queue. Older men, military officers, and those in conservative professions such as lawyers, judges, physicians, and servants retained their wigs and powder. Formal court dress of European monarchies also still required a powdered wig or long powdered hair tied in a queue until the accession of Napoleon to the throne as emperor (1804-1814).\n\nTricorne and bicorne hats were still worn, but the most fashionable hat was tall and slightly conical; this would soon, however, be displaced by the top hat and reign as the only hat for formal occasions for the next century.\n\nStyle gallery 1795–1809\n\nPortrait of boxer \"Jem\" Belcher wearing a patterned cravat and a double-breasted brown coat with a dark (fur or velvet?) collar, c. 1800.\nWatercolor of Beau Brummell by Richard Dighton.\nIn this self-portrait of 1805, Washington Allston wears a tan cravat with his high white collar and dark coat.

He wears a white waistcoat, shirt, and cravat, and light-colored pantaloons, 1819.\n\nChildren's fashion\nBoth boys and girls wore dresses until they were about four or five years old, when boys were \"breeched\", or put into trousers.\n\nRevival of Directoire/Empire/Regency fashions\nDuring the first half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less negative view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable to be reminded that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or take seriously) the struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.\n\nLater in the Victorian period, the Regency seemed to retreat to an unthreateningly remote historical distance, and Kate Greenaway and the Artistic Dress movement selectively revived elements of early 19th century fashions. During the late Victorian and Edwardian periods, many genre paintings, sentimental valentines, etc. contained loose depictions of 1795–1820 styles (then considered to be quaint relics of a bygone era). In the late 1960s / early 1970s, there was a limited fashion revival of the Empire silhouette.\n\nIn recent years, 1795–1820 fashions are most strongly associated with Jane Austen's writings, due to the various movie adaptations of her novels. There are also some Regency fashion urban myths, such as that women dampened their gowns to make them appear even more diaphanous (something which was certainly not practiced by the vast majority of women of the period).\n\nAn 1857 cartoon making fun of the contemporary distaste for early 19th century clothes.\n\"Before Waterloo\" by Henry Nelson O'Neil (1868), a mid-Victorian painting which deliberately does not show accurate women's styles of 1815.\n\"Two Strings to her Bow\" by John Pettie (1882), a later Victorian genre painting which uses the Regency period for nostalgia value.\nMay Day by Kate Greenaway.\n\nSee also\nAlmack's\nBeau Brummel\nCorset controversy\nDandy\nHistory of fashion\nLady Caroline Lamb\nRegency dance\nSeason (society)\nWhite's\n\nFootnotes\n\nFurther reading\nA Lady of Distinction: The Mirror of Graces, R.L.

{"id": "4104613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattress", "title": "Pattress", "text": "A pattress or pattress box or fitting box (in the United States and Canada, electrical wall switch box, electrical wall outlet box, electrical ceiling box, switch box, outlet box, electrical box, etc.) is the container for the space behind electrical fittings such as power outlet sockets, light switches, or fixed light fixtures. Pattresses may be designed for either surface mounting (with cabling running along the wall surface) or for embedding in the wall or skirting board. Some electricians use the term \"pattress box\" to describe a surface-mounted box, although simply the term \"pattress\" suffices.  The term \"flush box\" is used for a mounting box that goes inside the wall, although some use the term \"wall box\". Boxes for installation within timber/plasterboard walls are usually called \"cavity boxes\" or \"plasterboard boxes\". A ceiling-mounted pattress (most often used for light fixtures) is referred to as a \"ceiling pattress\" or \"ceiling box\". British English speakers also tend to say \"pattress box\" instead of just \"pattress\". Pattress is alternatively spelt \"patress\" and Wiktionary lists both spellings. The word \"pattress\", despite being attested from the late 19th century, is still rarely found in dictionaries. It is etymologically derived from pateras (Latin for bowls, saucers). The term is not used by electricians in the United States.\n\nPattresses\nPattresses contain devices for input (switches) and output (sockets and fixtures), with transfer managed by junction boxes. A pattress may be made of metal or plastic. In the United Kingdom, surface-mounted boxes in particular are often made from urea-formaldehyde resin or alternatively PVC and usually white. Wall boxes are commonly made of thin galvanised metal. A pattress box is made to standard dimensions and may contain embedded bushings (in standard positions) for the attachment of wiring devices (switches and sockets). Internal pattress boxes themselves do not include the corresponding faceplates, since the devices to be contained in the box specify the required faceplate. External pattress boxes may offer include corresponding faceplates, limiting the devices to be contained in the box.\n\nAlthough cables may be joined inside pattress boxes, due simply to their presence at convenient points in the wiring, their main purpose is to accommodate switches and sockets. They allow switches and sockets to be recessed into the wall for a better appearance. Enclosures primarily for joining wires are called junction boxes.\n\nNew work boxes\nNew work boxes are designed to be installed in a new installation. They are typically designed with nail or screw holes to attach directly to wall studs.\n\nOld work boxes\nOld work boxes are designed to attach to already-installed wall material (usually drywall). The boxes will almost always have two or more parsellas (from Latin: \"small wing or part). The parsellas flip out when the box screws are screwed, securing the box to the wall with the help of the four or more tabs on the front of the box.\n\nAlternative systems \nIn some countries, for instance in Germany, wall boxes for electrical fittings generally are not actual rectangular boxes at all but standard-sized round recessed containers. This has the advantage that the corresponding round holes can be simply drilled out with a hole saw rather than needing the cutting-out of a rectangular cavity to accommodate the wall box. Even with those round-hole systems, the faceplates that cover them are mostly rectangular however.\n\nImage gallery\n\nSee also\n\n Wall anchor plates are also known as pattress plates.\n Junction box, an enclosure housing electrical connections\n Electrical wiring in the United Kingdom\n Electrical wiring in North America\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n DIY Wiki Pattress page – more information on (British) pattresses and terminology\n\nCables\nElectrical wiring"}

He resided in Suffah of the mosque with other poor Muslims, who were called the \"guests of Islam\" and received charity from Muhammad.\n\nMuhammad arrived in Madina on Friday, 12th of Rabiul Awwal, 1AH. The first task upon his arrival was the construction of Muhammad’s mosque- at the site of the camel’s kneeling. The site belonged to two orphan boys- it was previously a graveyard of the polytheists. The Muslims began the construction of the Mosque (Masjidun Nabi). The mosque contained Muhammad's house. It also had a place for the Muslims who had neither family nor home (As-Sufa). Rabi’ah Ibn Ka’b Al Aslami was amongst the companions who lived in As-Sufa. \n\nRabi’ah Ibn Ka’b Al Aslami was a young, poor companion who lived in Suffa (part of the Masjid in Madina reserved for the poor homeless companions). He devoted himself to the service of Muhammad. He used to pour the water for Muhammad's wudu and do other services. He was so eager to serve Muhammad that he would sleep by the front door of his house so if Muhammad called him, he could rush to his service immediately. Once Muhammad called him and Rabi’ah replied with “Labaik Ya Rasool Allah wa Sa’daik”. Muhammad wished to reward and repay Rabi’ah for his services and asked him what he would like. Rabi’ah asked for some time to think over what he wanted. As he was poor, he thought of asking for wealth but then changed his mind. When Muhammad asked him what he wanted the second time, Rabi’ah said “Murafaqatuka fil Jannah Ya Rasool Allah” (I want your companionship in Paradise of Messenger of Allah). Muhammad asked him if he wanted anything else but Rabi’ah said no, that is all he wished for so Muhammad told him to help himself by increasing in prostration. Rabi’ah was always seen in prostration after that. \n\nMuhammad arranged his marriage to a good family and gave him land next to Abu Bakr’s land. Once, Rabi’ah and Abu Bakr got into an argument over a palm tree in their lands. Abu Bakr, in the heat of the argument, swore at Rabi’ah and felt immediate regret. He told Rabi’ah to say the swear word back to him as an act of retaliation but Rabi’ah refused. Abu Bakr demanded Rabi’ah swears at him with the same word but Rabi’ah still refused so Abu Bakr got angry and said he would go and complain to Muhammad. Rabi’ah’s people from Banu Aslam came to Rabi’ah’s defence and were shocked by Abu Bakr’s actions that he swears and then he goes to complain to Muhammad. Rabi’ah told them to go away and that if Abu Bakr sees them, he might get angry and as a result, Muhammad would get angry and therefore Allah would get angry and thus Rabi’ah would be destroyed. Rabi’ah followed Abu Bakr and arrived at Muhammad’s location. Muhammad asked Rabi’ah what the matter was. Rabi’ah said that Abu Bakr swore at him and wanted him to swear back to make it even but he refused. Muhammad said he did well and guided him to say to Abu Bakr “Ghafar Allahu Lak” (May Allah forgive you) instead. Abu Bakr began to cry. Muhammad ruled the palm tree belonged to Rabi’ah Ibn Ka’b. \n\nCompanions of the Prophet"}

{"id": "4104633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vihren", "title": "Vihren", "text": "Vihren ( ) is the highest peak of Bulgaria's Pirin Mountains. Reaching , it is Bulgaria's second and the Balkans' third highest, after Musala and Mount Olympus. Although due to the karst topography Vihren is deprived of lakes and streams, a number of Pirin's lakes are located around the peak, as is Europe's southernmost glacial mass, the Snezhnika glacieret. Until 1942 Vihren was known as Eltepe (peak of storms); it was also called Buren (stormy) and Malnienosets (lightning-bringer). The UNESCO World Heritage Site Pirin National Park was originally known as the Vihren National Park. Vihren is included in the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria under No. 2.\n\nGeography \n\nVihren is situated in the northern subdivision of Pirin on the mountain's main ridge between the summits of Kutelo (2,908 m) to the north-west and Hvoynati Vrah (2,635 m) to the south-east. It is connected with these two peaks via the saddles of Premkata (2,610 m) to the north and Kabata (2,535 m) to the south. The summit is located between the valleys of the rivers Vlahina reka of the Struma drainage to the west and Banderitsa of the Mesta drainage to the east.\n\nSeen from the town of Bansko, situated at the foothills of Pirin to the north-east of Vihren, the peak looks like a truncated pyramid, and from the south — like а tetrahedral pyramid. The summit is built up marbles and has a karst topography which determines the lack of streams and lakes around Vihren. The closest lakes are the Vlahini Lakes to the south-west. To the north are situated the deep and waterless cirques Golemiya Kazan and Malkiya Kazan, known as the Kazanite (the cauldrons). Below the 450 m-high walls of Vihren facing Golemiya Kazan there is a small glacier called Snezhnika, which is Europe's southernmost glacial mass. Its size in summer is 80x90 m.\n\nThe average annual minimal temperature varies between –25° and –21°С, while the maximal temperatures are between 15° and 23°С. The mean annual precipitation is 1150 mm; the snow cover reaches depth of 3 m. There is a meteorological station at 1,950 m.\n\nWildlife \n\nThe wildlife is alpine. The flora of Vihren's slopes consists of herbaceous plants and lichens. Vihren is home to a number of habitats, including alpine and sub-alpine open calcareous grasslands that at inclination of 30–45° at altitude over 2,500 m on the marble bedrock forms phytocenosis dominated by Sesleria korabensis, and alpine and sub-alpine closed calcareous grasslands on very rocky bedrock. With less abundance is the relict plant Carex rupestris; some plant communities have an abundance of Carex kitaibeliana and Sesleria coerulans. There are also Alyssum cuneifolium, Bellardiochloa variegata, Bromus lacmonicus, Cerastium lanatum, Koeleria eriostachya, Onobrychis pindicola, Scutellaria alpina, Sesleria coerulans, etc. Rare or endemic herbaceous plants that grow on the slopes of Vihren are edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum), Pirin poppy (Papaver degenii), Oxytropis urumovii, Alyssum pirinicum, Timmia norvegica, Thymus perinicus, etc.\n\nThe fauna includes various bird species, small mammals and abundant populations of chamois.\n\nTourism \n\nVihren is among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria under No. 2 and stamps to verify the visit can be found in the Museum of Nikola Vaptsarov in Bansko and in Vihren refuge. The summit is part of the initiative of the Bulgarian Tourist Union \"Conqueror of the Top Ten Mountain Peaks\" to promote mountaineering.\n\nVihren was first climbed in winter on 9 January 1925 by T.Atanasov, D.Stoykov, V.Baynov and N.Bozhinov. The classical route to climb the peak is from the Vihren refuge (1,950 m) to the south via the Kabata saddle; this route takes three to four hours in summer and is steep reaching denivelation of almost 1,000 m in а short time. Other routes include those from the Banderitsa refuge (1,810 m) or across the knife-edge crest Koncheto from the north. From the Kazanite cirques in the north there is a 400 m-high steep wall which has several tracks from alpine climbing. This wall was first climbed in 1934 by the German alpinists W.Mosel and F.Auer; in winter it was first ascended in 1949 by Al.Belkovski and Vl.Lobodin.\n\nFrom the top there is a view to almost the whole of northern Pirin, as well as to the mountain ranges of Rila, Rhodope, Maleshevo, Ograzhden, Belasica and Slavyanka.\n\nHonour \nVihren Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Vihren.\n\nSee also\n\nPirin\nKutelo\nPirin National Park\nList of mountains in Bulgaria\nGeography of Bulgaria\nList of mountains of the Balkans\nSouthernmost glacial mass in Europe\nList of European ultra-prominent peaks\nList of the highest European ultra-prominent peaks\nMost isolated major summits of Europe\nList of mountain ranges\n\nReferences\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nMountains of Pirin\nLandforms of Blagoevgrad Province\nTwo-thousanders of Bulgaria"}

This page explains the principal systems that were used.\n\n For information about individual classes and locomotives, see: Locomotives of the Southern Railway\n\nNumbering\n\nPost-grouping numbering\nWhen the SR was created in 1923, it immediately set about finding a solution to the problem that many of its inherited locomotives carried the same numbers. The first solution, was to prefix all locomotive numbers with a letter derived from the first letter of the main locomotive works on each section of the SR. New locomotives were then given a prefixed number in the appropriate series for the area in which they worked. Later, the letter prefix was dropped and numbers were increased by a certain number of thousands, as follows:\n\n Ex-South Eastern and Chatham Railway: 'A' (for Ashford), later 1000 added\n Ex-London, Brighton and South Coast Railway: 'B' (for Brighton), later 2000 added\n Ex-London and South Western Railway: 'E' (for Eastleigh), later reverted to original numbers\n\nThe LSWR had renumbered its older locomotives into a 'duplicate list' series (for locomotives that were no longer in capital stock, but which were not yet life-expired) by adding '0' to the front of their original number (e.g. 0298). When the prefix letters were dropped by the SR, the surviving locomotives in this list had the '0' replaced with a '3' (e.g. 0298 became 3298).\n\nAn exception to this general arrangement was the numbering of locomotives on the Isle of Wight. Inherited locomotives and those transferred to the island by the SR were renumbered into a single list commencing at 1 and prefixed by the letter 'W' (for Wight).\n\nFrom 1942, the SR adopted a numbering system for new-build locomotives (both steam and electric types) based on their wheel arrangement according to the UIC classification scheme, e.g., C1-40 (for the SR Class Q1 of forty 0-6-0 locomotives), etc. If the UIC classification was applied entirely correctly it would result in confusion on locomotives with trailing axles, since these are represented by a number. Therefore the SR put the unpowered axle counts first, then the driven axles, then the locomotive's unique number; for instance the  SR-built Merchant Navy class was numbered 21C1-20 (two leading axles, one trailing axle, three driven axles, twenty locomotives). This system did not clearly distinguish between different classes of locomotives with the same wheel arrangement, although different blocks of numbers could be assigned - the subsequent Light Pacific classes had their numbers start at 21C101 and SR construction finished at 21C170.  This approach was not retrospectively applied to older locomotives.\n\nClassification\n\nConstituent companies\n\nLondon & South Western Railway\nFrom 1 January 1879 the principal LSWR works at Nine Elms (and, subsequently, Eastleigh) used an order number series that ran from A1 to Y1, then A2 to Y2, A3 to Y3 and so on (the letter I, J, Q, U, W and Z were omitted). The system was brought to the LSWR by William Adams from the Stratford Works of the Great Eastern Railway, where an almost identical system was in use from 1856 until after Grouping. This series was used for a myriad of items, including locomotives, but it was these numbers that were used to refer to locomotive classes. The highest-numbered locomotive class was 'H16'. The first three orders ('A1', 'B1', and 'C1') were for components: cylinders, tender wheels, and copper fireboxes respectively. The system was inconsistently applied with regard to the LSWR A12 class, for which the first batch was allocated the work number 'A12' in 1887, the second in 1888 was 'E1' and the third the following year was 'M2'. Even if 'A12' was a typographical error for 'A2', it should still have come after 'E1'. \n\nWhere more than one order number had been used for a given class, the first order number allocated was used to refer to the whole class: For instance, the 105 examples of the M7 Class were built over 15 years. The first order was for 25 locomotives and was works order number M7. The next order for 10 locomotives was order number V7 and construction continued across a further 13 batches until A15, all designated as M7s after the original order. Where locomotives were purchased from outside manufacturers, they were referred to by the number applied to the first class member. Self-evidently this meant there was no continuity in the LSWR locomotive classification system; save that if the letters be ignored, higher figures generally meant a more modern design.\n\nSouthern Railway\nPerhaps because the focus of the SR was on electrification, no standard classification of steam locomotives was developed. Instead, the classes allocated by its pre-Grouping constituents were perpetuated and new locomotive types allocated classes accordingly.\n\nWhere SR-design classes were named, then the class was often referred to by the initials of the naming theme, e.g. 'BB' for Battle of Britain class, 'LN' for Lord Nelson class, 'MN' for Merchant Navy class, and 'WC' for 'West Country' class. This did not apply to the 'Schools' class however, which was SR Class V.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSouthern Railway (UK)\nLocomotive classification systems"}

Its area is 1,009 km2, and its population is 30,521 (2022). As of 2023 the mayor is Osman İnan of the  AKP.\n\nHistory\n\nByzantine period\nNothing is known about this city during antiquity. Chariopolis is first mentioned with the presence of Theophylact, Bishop of Chariopolis (ἐπίσκοπος Χαριουπόλεως), at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and of Bishop Kosmas at the Fourth Council of Constantinople in 879. Nevertheless, it first appears in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople only in the early 10th century, as a suffragan the metropolitan see of Heraclea. Byzantine emperor and founder of the Macedonian dynasty, Basil I, was born to a peasant family in Chariopolis, possibly in 811.\n\nIn the 11th century, a bishop Michael is known through his seal; from the decoration it appears that he may have previously been a member of the clergy of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. The town is mentioned in the later 11th century as the site of military operations against invading nomadic tribes: the general Nikephoros Bryennios campaigned against the Pechenegs in 1051; in 1087 the town itself was sacked by a host of Pechenegs, Cumans, and Magyars;  and in 1090 the Pechenegs defeated a Byzantine force in its vicinity.\n\nOn 15/16 April 1205 Geoffrey of Villehardouin spent the night there, after the disastrous Battle of Adrianople. In the aftermath of the battle, Chariopolis and other nearby towns were conquered by the Bulgarians under Tsar Kaloyan; a large part of the population was forcibly deported and resettled along the Danube.\n\nIn 1305 or 1306, an unnamed bishop of Chariopolis attended a synod called by Patriarch Athanasius I of Constantinople to condemn John Drimys. A priest named Garianos settled in the town shortly after, fleeing from the Bogomils in northern Thrace. In 1316 he was himself accused of Bogomilism, but was acquitted by a synod under Patriarch John XIII of Constantinople. In 1322, Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos led his army to the town, where he dismissed up to a thousand of his men. In 1344, Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos briefly took up residence in the town. In 1347, the subordination of the bishopric of Chariopolis to Heraclea was formally renewed by imperial prostagma. In December 1349, Kantakouzenos awarded a metochion in the town to the Vatopedi Monastery on Mount Athos. In 1351, the local bishop, whose name is not recorded, participated in a synod against Barlaam of Calabria under Patriarch Callistus I of Constantinople.\n\nOttoman period\nIn the later 1350s, the Ottoman expansion into Thrace began, under the prince Süleyman Pasha. After Kantakouzenos' abdication in 1354, Süleyman conquered many cities \"up to Chariopolis\", establishing the first Ottoman province on European soil. If Chariopolis was not conquered in this first wave, then it definitely fell to Süleyman between 1359 and 1362. As a result of the Ottoman conquest, by the end of the 14th century, the bishopric became a titular see, and vanishes completely in the 15th century. The Catholic Church still lists Chariopolis as a titular see, with eight incumbents between 1713 and 1970.\n\nThe traveller Evliya Çelebi visited the town in the mid-17th century, describing it as prosperous, a \"little Edirne\", with much water and beautiful gardens. According to Evliya it was a favoured residence of Ottoman aristocrats. He also reports that the town was a centre of extensive animal husbandry, with large flocks, including camels. \n\nA Greek community, 3,476 strong in 1922, survived in the town until the Greco-Turkish population exchange.\n\nModern period\nToday Hayrabolu is a small market town serving the countryside around it.\n\nMonuments\nNo Byzantine-era structures survive, but in the early 20th century a local church, dedicated to St. Basil, may have been built on the site of a Byzantine predecessor, and a Byzantine capital was incorporated into the Local Pasha Mosque. At the entrance to the settlement is a 16th-century Ottoman bridge.\n\nComposition\nThere are 52 neighbourhoods in Hayrabolu District:\n\n Ataköy\n Avluobası\n Aydınevler\n Aydınlar\n Bayramşah\n Büyükkarakarlı\n Buzağcı\n Cambazdere\n Canhıdır\n Çeneköy\n Çerkezmüsellim\n Çıkrıkçı\n Dambaslar\n Danişment\n Delibedir\n Emiryakup\n Fahrioğlu\n Hacılı\n Hasköy\n Hedeyli\n Hisar\n İlyas\n İsmailli\n Kabahöyük\n Kadriye\n Kahya\n Kandamış\n Karababa\n Karabürçek\n Karakavak\n Karayahşi\n Kemaller\n Kılıçlar\n Küçükkarakarlı\n Kurtdere\n Kutlugün\n Lahana\n Muzruplu\n Öreyköy\n Övenler\n Parmaksız\n Şalgamlı\n Soylu\n Subaşı\n Susuzmüsellim\n Tatarlı\n Temrezli\n Tuğcalı\n Umurbey\n Umurcu\n Yörgüç\n Yörükler\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n District municipality's official website\n\n \nPopulated places in Tekirdağ Province\nPopulated places of the Byzantine Empire\nDistricts of Tekirdağ Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nPomak communities in Turkey"}

{"id": "4104668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghain%20Aboth%20Synagogue", "title": "Maghain Aboth Synagogue", "text": "The Maghain Aboth Synagogue (, translit: Ma'gen Ahvot, \"Guardian of Patriarchs\" or \"Shield of our Fathers\") is a synagogue in Singapore. It is located at 24/26 Waterloo Street in Rochor, within the Central Area at Singapore's central business district. Constructed in 1878, it is the oldest and largest Jewish synagogue in Southeast Asia and the second largest in Asia itself, outside of Israel.\n\nManaged by the Jewish Welfare Board, it remains to be the main place of worship for the Jewish community in Singapore. It was designated as a national monument of Singapore in 1998. Today, the synagogue and its surroundings has served as the unofficial centre of Jewish activity  in Singapore, with several Jewish buildings standing within its vicinity, including a kosher supermarket and a museum.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly years\nAs early as 1831, Singapore's earliest Jewish settlers were Mizrahi/Sephardic merchants from mainly modern-day Iraq and Iran who came to trade.\n\nIn 1870, one of the Synagogue's new trustees, Joseph Joshua, negotiated to buy a plot of land owned by Raffles Institution at Bras Basah for $4,000 in order to build a new synagogue. However, not enough funds were raised to build the new synagogue within the 3-years period agreement.\n\nConstruction\nConstruction of Maghain Aboth began after the land was acquired and was completed in 1878. In 1893, a U-shaped balcony was added to form the second-storey of the building with the purpose of accommodating the female members of the community.\n\nLater in 1924 to 1925, extensions were made to the building and a more solid and permanent gallery was built. The synagogue started to hold a congregation of approximately 40 and served the local Jewish community for 30 years before it was sold. The building was later demolished after World War II. However, parts of the original building remains in use in the present.\n\nJapanese occupation\nDuring the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, the synagogue was a significant gathering place for the local Jews to exchange news and collect funds to help those in need. In the past, oil lamps were used during services and they still remain in the present day, hanging from steel rods in loving memory of those who have passed on. The Maghain Aboth Synagogue was gazetted as a national monument later on 27 February 1998.\n\nContemporary era\nIn 2007, a seven-storey building called the Jacob Ballas Centre was added to the compound next to the Maghain Aboth Synagogue. It was named after the late Jacob Ballas who was seen as a pillar of the Jewish community in Singapore. The centre provides facilities to meet the needs of the Jewish community such as offices and homes for the Rabbis and the Yeshivah boys, a women's mikvah, a slaughter room for kosher chickens, a kosher restaurant, a kosher shop and a social hall for events and functions including Shabbat and festival meals. Descendants of most of the earliest Jewish settlers in the country are today Singaporean citizens.\n\nIn March 2021, the Internal Security Department reported that it had detained a 20-year old national serviceman, Amirull Ali, in February under the Internal Security Act for plotting to attack three Jewish worshippers at the Maghain Aboth Synagogue. Ali was motivated by sympathy towards the Palestinians and believed that these three men had served in the Israel Defense Forces and committed atrocities against the Palestinians. He also reportedly planned to travel to Gaza to join Hamas' military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.\n\nThe Jews of Singapore Museum\nOn 2 December 2021, The Jews of Singapore Museum opened its doors beside the synagogue at the Jacob Ballas Centre, which traces the history of the Jews in Singapore and the contributions notable Jews have made to Singaporean society.\n\nArchitecture\n\nAs Jewish men and women worship separately in an Orthodox synagogue, the synagogue's original single-storey building could only accommodate men.\n\nThe U-shaped second-storey balcony was originally made up wooden slats of makeshift nature which the women were able to see through very clearly. Therefore, the original simple design was deemed inadequate and thus, later constructed to be a solid gallery which was added to the main building which remains in use today.\n\nThe synagogue is a symmetrical building which has adopted a neo-classical style and colonial architecture. The design of the building was influenced by the Late Renaissance architectural style in Britain. The building has a repetitive sequence of Palladian arcades and pedestals and within the building, the hall has traditional Roman columns and rusticated walls which is bare of any decoration or image. Along the corners and sides of the building are pilasters topped with decorative capitals. The synagogue's doorways are also adorned with arches with classical keystone architecture. A covered porch fronts the building with steps leading up to the vestibule originally designed for horse carriages.\n\nMost of the windows are of a similar rectangular design and are timber-louvred. The windows are an important feature of a synagogue because based on the Talmud, Jewish synagogues are required to have windows. Despite the deliberate simple design of the synagogue, the building still remains to be elegant due to the combination of its timber-louvred windows, marble floors and red carpets with teak and rattan pews.\n\nThe prayer hall is facing west towards Jerusalem and the bimah, an elevated platform in the centre, faces the alcove known as the 'hekhal', which is used to store the Torah scrolls, that is at the West wall of the hall. The parochet which is an embroidered fringed curtain that is rich in details is used to cover the Torah ark. In front of it hangs the sanctuary lamp which signifies the eternal flame that burned in the former Temple of Jerusalem.\n\nSee also\n History of the Jews in Singapore\n Chesed-El Synagogue\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n Lee Geok Boi (2002), The Religious Monuments of Singapore, Landmark Books, \n Maghain Aboth Synagogue – National Heritage Board\n\nExternal links\nThe Virtual Jewish History Tour Singapore\nThe Jewish Community of Singapore \n\nHasidic Judaism in Asia\nSynagogues in Singapore\nLandmarks in Singapore\nNational monuments of Singapore\nSynagogues completed in 1878\nRochor\nIranian-Jewish diaspora\nIraqi-Jewish diaspora in Asia\nNeoclassical synagogues\n19th-century architecture in Singapore"}

{"id": "4104684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C4%B1n%C4%B1s", "title": "Hınıs", "text": "Hınıs (; ) is a municipality and district of Erzurum Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,367 km2, and its population is 24,680 (2022). Historical monuments in the town include the castle and the Ulu Cami Mosque, said to be built in 1734 by Alaeddin, the bey of Muş. The town is populated by Kurds.\n\nThe district, which is 150 km away from the city of Muş, is very close to Hamurpert Lake, which has an important place in history. Hınıs district is surrounded by the Ak Dağ mountains from the north, Bingöl Mountains from the west and south, and Akdoğan mountains from the south to the east. Hınıs district is neighbors with Tekman and Karayazı districts to the north, Karaçoban district to the east, and Varto, Bulanık and Malazgirt districts of Muş to the south. In addition, the Varto city is only 40 km from Hınıs. Hınıs is a plain district and Hınıs plain is one of the most fertile plains of the region. Therefore, agriculture and animal husbandry are the main sources of income in the district. It has the same characteristics as Erzurum in terms of climate and nature. Winters are cold and snowy, and summers are generally cool. In general, it can be said that it is 5-6 degrees warmer than Erzurum.\n\nGeography\n\nThe Hınıs plain is an upland plain centered on a tributary of the Murat River. A range of hills on the south separates the Hınıs plain from the Murat River. Kocasu Creek is the biggest water source of Hınıs. It passes through the district center and pours into the Murat river in Bulanık district. On the southwest, the Hınıs plain is separated from the Varto plain by a series of hills and steep valleys. To the north is a range of pyramid-shaped hills called the Ak Dağ, or White Mountains, which are in turn connected to the Bingöl Mountains further west by a plateau called the Menge Dağ. The Menge Dağ forms the northwestern border of the Hınıs plain; from its foothills, Süphan mountain is visible over the hills to the southeast. The Hınıs plain consists of two distinct, gently undulating bands that are occasionally broken up by low-lying hills. The valley has fertile soil and has historically formed a breeding ground for sheep and horses.\n\nThe town of Hınıs itself lies near the upper end of the valley, on a volcanic table raised above the surrounding plain. At this end, more than 20 smaller streams join together into the plain's main river.\n\nHistory\nThe Hınıs plain formed the main part of the early medieval Armenian canton of Varazhnunik. During this period (roughly the 4th through 7th centuries), Hınıs was probably a fortified market town. Later, after the Arab conquest of Armenia, the region became divided into several small principalities. Hınıs was \"almost certainly\" the capital of one of these principalities, which was called Sermatz in Greek sources. Sermatz seems to have covered the old district of Varazhnunik as well as the Varto plain to the southwest. Its rulers were probably vassals of the Kaysite emirs of Malazgirt.\n\nDuring the Kara Koyunlu period, Hınıs was the capital of a small Kurdish emirate which was a vassal of the emirate of Bitlis, which was in turn a vassal of the Kara Koyunlu themselves. The emirate of Hınıs was mainly based on the Hınıs plain but also extended south of the Murat river to include Lake Nazik and the area around Bulanık. Later, under the Ottoman Empire, Hınıs formed a sanjak of Erzurum Eyalet.\n\nMonuments\n\nCastle\nHınıs's old castle crowns a small rocky promontory jutting out above a depression in the middle of the plateau. The castle rock is only accessible on one side, by an elevated \"neck\" connecting it to the rest of the plateau. This \"neck\" was the starting point for the walls that historically surrounded the town. Only a couple of towers of the castle remain intact today.\n\nMosque\nThe Ulu Cami is beneath the castle rock and outside the town. It dates to 1734 and is traditionally attributed to Ala ed-Din, the bey of Muş who also fortified Mercimekkale on the Muş plain. The mosque is roughly cube-shaped, with one relatively small pyramidal cap crowning the roof, surrounded by 8 smaller domes. The mosque has one, black-and-white striped minaret, on the northwest corner.\n\nComposition\nThere are 98 neighbourhoods in Hınıs District:\n\n Acarköy\n Akbayır\n Akçamelik\n Akgelin\n Akgöze\n Akören\n Alaca\n Alagöz\n Alikırı\n Alınteri\n Altınpınar\n Arpadere\n Aşağı Kayabaşı\n Avcılar\n Bahçe\n Başköy\n Bayırköy\n Bellitaş\n Beyyurdu\n Burhanköy\n Çakmak\n Çamurlu\n Çatak\n Çilligöl\n Dağçayırı\n Demirci\n Derince\n Dervişali\n Dibekli\n Dikili\n Divanhüseyin\n Elbeyli\n Elmadalı\n Erduran\n Erence\n Esenli\n Göller\n Güllüçimen\n Gülüstan\n Gürçayır\n Güzeldere\n Halilçavuş\n Hayran\n Ilıcaköy\n İsmail\n Kalecik\n Karaağaç\n Karabudak\n Karakula\n Karamolla\n Kazancı\n Ketenci\n Kısık\n Kızılahmet\n Kızmusa\n Kolhisar\n Kongur\n Köprübaşı\n Meydanköy\n Mezraa\n Mollacelil\n Mollakulaç\n Mutluca\n Ortaköy\n Ovaçevirme\n Ovakozlu\n Parmaksız\n Pınarbaşı\n Pınarköy\n Şahabettinköy\n Şahverdi\n Şalgamköy\n Saltepe\n Sanayi\n Sarılı\n Sıldız\n Söğütlü\n Sultanlı\n Suvaran\n Tanır\n Tapuköy\n Taşbulak\n Tellitepe\n Tipideresi\n Toprakkale\n Toraman\n Uluçayır\n Ünlüce\n Uyanık\n Yamanlar\n Yaylakonak\n Yelpiz\n Yenikent\n Yeniköy\n Yeşilbahçe\n Yeşilyazı\n Yolüstü\n Yukarı Kayabaşı\n\nReferences\n\n \nPopulated places in Erzurum Province\nKurdish settlements in Turkey\nDistricts of Erzurum Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey"}

The churches are often cited as \"twin\", due to their similar external appearance: they have indeed some differences, in both plan and exterior details.\n\nLooking from the square, the two churches define the so-called \"trident\" of streets departing from Piazza del Popolo: starting from the left, Via del Babuino, Via del Corso and Via di Ripetta. The first two are separated by Santa Maria in Montesanto, the latter by Santa Maria dei Miracoli.\n\nThe origin of the two churches traces back to the 17th-century restoration of what was the main entrance to the Middle Ages and Renaissance Rome, from the Via Flaminia (known as Via Lata and Via del Corso in its urban trait). Pope Alexander VII commissioned the monumental design of the entrance of Via del Corso to architect Carlo Rainaldi. This included two churches with central plans, but the different shapes of the two areas available forced deep modifications to the projects.\n\nBoth were financed by cardinal Girolamo Gastaldi, whose crest is present in the two churches.\n\nSanta Maria dei Miracoli\n\nSanta Maria dei Miracoli was begun in 1675 and finished in 1681. With a circular plan, it has an elegant 18th-century bell tower by Girolamo Theodoli and an octagonal cupola. The interior has a rich stucco decoration by Antonio Raggi, Bernini's pupil. The monuments for Cardinals Benedetto and Gastaldi were designed by Carlo Fontana, who also provided design for the cupola and the lamp. The busts in bronze were completed by Girolamo Lucenti.\n\nAt the high altar is the miraculous image of the Virgin which has given the church its name. The first chapel on the right-hand side has an altar dedicated to Our Lady of Bétharram, named after a shrine near Lourdes. The Society of Priests of the Sacred Heart was founded at Bétharram. There is a reproduction of Renoir's Madonna at Bétharram.\n\nSanta Maria in Montesanto\n\nSanta Maria in Montesanto, erected over a church with the same name that lay at the beginning of Via del Babuino, was occupied by Carmelite friars. The name Montesanto (Holy Mountain) referred to Mount Carmel in Israel. The construction of the present church was begun on July 15, 1662, under the patronage of Cardinal Girolamo Gastaldi, and finished in 1675, with other additions by 1679. Originally designed by Carlo Rainaldi, the plans were revised by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, and ultimately completed by Carlo Fontana. A belfry was added in the 18th century. The statues of saints on the exterior have been attributed to Bernini's design. The interior has an elliptical plan, with a dodecagonal cupola. In 1825, the church was made a minor basilica.\n\nOn August 10, 1904, Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, the future Pope John XXIII, was ordained to the priesthood by Patriarch Giuseppe Ceppetelli in this church.\nIn 1953, Monsignor Ennio Francia established the tradition of the Mass of the Artists. On the last Sunday of October till June 29, a mass is held every Sunday with a reading by an artist, and animated by music. At the end of the mass, a prayer for \nthe artists is read. For these reasons the Montesanto church is also called the Church of the Artists.\n\nInterior decoration\nThe first chapel to the left is the cappella di Santa Lucia (Saint Lucy). The second chapel is dedicated to Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzi, designed by Carlo Rainaldi to honor the Carmelite nun canonized by Pope Clemente XI in 1669. The ceiling and the altarpiece of the Miracle of the saint (c. 1685) was painted by Ludovico Gimignani.\n\nThe third chapel is the cappella Montioni. The Monitoni family commissioned the design by Tommaso Mattei, pupil of Carlo Fontana. The altarpiece of the Madonna with Child and Saints Francis and Jacob (c. 1687) was completed by Carlo Maratta. The Assumption fresco was painted by Giuseppe Chiari. Upon the altar is a modern statue of the Angel for the artists by  Guelfo (1937–1997). At one time, the sacristy held frescoes by Baciccia.\n\nThe presbytery is stuccoed with angels by Filippo Carcani and houses the miraculous 15th-century altarpiece of Virgin of Montesanto, which tradition holds was painted by an 11-year-old girl. The sacristy has a frescoed vault with angels and the instruments of passion, the altarpiece of the Deposition (c. 1600) is attributed to Biagio Puccini.\n\nSee also\n Roman Catholic Marian churches\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Federico Gizzi, Le chiese barocche di Roma, 1998, Newton Compton, Rome.\n Basilica di Santa Maria in Montesanto.

It was a member organization of the consortium of public-law broadcasting organizations in Germany, ARD.\n\nORB merged with the Berlin public broadcaster Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) on 1 May 2003 to form Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB). Signals began as members of Deutscher Fernsehfunk.\n\nHistory\nFollowing German reunification, ARD expanded its membership to include public broadcasters in the territory of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Four public-broadcasting organizations replaced those of the former GDR: the already existing Hamburg-based Norddeutscher Rundfunk in the north; the already existing West Berlin-based SFB, now covering all of the city; the new Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk for the states of Thuringia, Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt; and the new Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg.\n\nCreated on 12 October 1991, ORB joined ARD on 27 November and formally took over from the former Rundfunk der DDR on 1 January 1992.\n\nORB had originally planned to call itself Ostdeutscher Rundfunk (ODR - East German Broadcasting) on the pattern of the already existing Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR - North German Broadcasting), Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR - South German Broadcasting), and Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR - West German Broadcasting). However, faced with the criticism that the designation ODR could be taken as implying that the new organization covered the whole of the former \"East Germany\", a more specific name was chosen in the autumn of 1991.\n\nORB television was broadcast from the former studios of the official GDR film company, Deutsche Film AG, whilst the radio services originated in the Funkhaus Nalepastraße, the former headquarters of the GDR's broadcasting service.\n\nIn 1995 the Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg in coalition with the Sender Freies Berlin started their Internet radio streaming service Info-Radio on Demand.\n\nServices\n\nRadio\nOn commencing broadcasting on 1 January 1992, ORB had three radio stations. \nAntenne Brandenburg – begun by the former GDR in May 1990.

The third network mostly carried ARD programming for cost reasons. ORB broadcast news programmes at 19:00 and 20:45. However, the main evening news in the GDR had long been at 19:30, and this was the preferred time for most viewers. On 1 May 1992, the schedules were radically altered to account for the habits of the viewers, with the main local news being moved to 19:30 - a position it keeps on RBB's successor service.

Its area is 449 km2, and its population is 34,074 (2022).\n\nHonaz is about 20 km (12 mi) east of the city of Denizli on the slopes of the mountain of the same name – Mount Honaz (Honaz Dağı). The mountain is the highest peak in Turkey's Aegean Region (2517 m). Just north of Honaz is Honaz Stream (Honaz Çayı), known in ancient times as the Lycus.\n\nHistory\n\nIn antiquity it was known as Colossae. At 500 BC Colossae was founded by the Phrygians, and then passed into the hands of the Ancient Greeks. Herodotus and Xenophon both record the passage of Greek and Persian armies though here during the Persian Wars, at that time it was a large Phrygian city. A few ruins of the ancient city remain. Like many other ancient cities of the region, Colossae was destroyed by earthquakes, with little surviving.\n\nIn the Byzantine period its name was Chonai. The city and a bishopric of Chonai was established at the location of the present Honaz township by the Byzantines during the Arab invasions of the 7th century. Being further up the mountain the location was easier to defend. Following centuries of Byzantine rule the town was first captured by the Seljuk Turks in 1070, but was then reconquered during the Komnenian period. During the reign of Manuel I Komnenos it prospered as a frontier town, a trading and pilgrimage venue for both Christians and Muslims. The forces of Louis VII of France, en route to the Holy Land as part of the Second Crusade, were attacked here by the Turks in the battle of Mount Cadmus of 1148. The Byzantine chronicler Niketas Choniates (c. 1155-1215/1216) was a native of the city. Chonai was plundered twice by local independent warlords backed by the Turks (by Theodoros Mankaphas in late 1180s and by Pseudo-Alexios in 1192). It finally fell to the Seljuks soon afterwards. Kaykhusraw I promised to return it to the Byzantines, but in view of the collapse of imperial power caused by the Fourth Crusade and the Latin conquest of Constantinople he decided rather to assign it to his father-in-law, the Byzantine renegade Manuel Maurozomes. The latter held it as an autonomous lordship together with Laodikeia, near present-day Denizli, from 1205 until his death ca. 1230. Theodore I Laskaris came to accept it in a 1206 agreement with Kaykhusraw I.\n\nThere is a Seljuk fortress in Honaz, and the Murat Mosque which dates back to the reign of Ottoman Sultan Murat II (imperabat 1404–1451).\n\nIn the 20th century, Honaz was one of the places where the Vallahades or Valaades (ethnic Greek Muslims from southwest Greek Macedonia) were forced to resettle during the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey of 1922–23.\n\nComposition\nThere are 22 neighbourhoods in Honaz District:\n\n Afşinbey\n Akbaş\n Aşağıdağdere\n Aydınlar\n Cumhuriyet\n Dereçiftlik\n Emirazizli\n Gürleyik\n Haydar\n Hisar\n Hürriyet\n Kaklık\n Karaçay\n Karateke\n Kızılyer\n Kocabaş\n Menteşe\n Ovacık\n Sapaca\n Yeni\n Yokuşbaşı\n Yukarıdağdere\n\nHonaz today\nToday the economy of Honaz is centred on growing cherries, 80% of the crop being exported from Turkey,  generating up to 35 million dollars of income per annum. There is an annual cherry festival in the town. Tomatoes and other fruits and vegetables are grown too including a local variety of oleaster.\n\nHonaz is also the homeland of a number of well-known pehlivans (oil wrestlers) including the 3-time national champion Hüseyin Çokal.\n\nIn the nearby depending township of Kaklık, there is a large cave called \"Kaklık Cave\" or \"Kaklık Mağarası\"  which attracts visitors from all over the country. A spring that spurts out on the surface only to flow back underground shortly afterwards through the cave in cascading layers of limestone and travertine caused Kaklık to appear very much like a subterranean Pamukkale.\n\nReferences\n\n Klaus Belke, Norbert Mersich, Phrygien und Pisidien, Tabula Imperii Byzantini VII, Wien 1990, s. 309–311.\n O City of Byzantium, Annals of Niketas Choniates, ed.

It is located on the eastern Turkish Black Sea coast about  from the city of Artvin and 18 kilometres from the border with Georgia. It is the seat of Hopa District. Its population is 23,846 (2021).\n\nGeography\nHopa is on the Black Sea Coast  from Artvin and  from the Sarp border crossing (into Sarpi) on the Georgian border. The land climbs sharply from 10m above sea level in the coastal areas up into the Sultan Selim Mountains, the hillsides are well watered and green with alder, chestnuts, hornbeams and other deciduous trees. The highest point is Mt Yavuz Sultan Selim at 1513m. The climate is mild and wet, although only July and August are warm enough to be called summer. There is annual snowfall in winter.\n\nThe town consists of 7 quarters: Bucak, Merkez Kuledibi, Ortahopa, Sundura, Yukarı Kuledibi, Cumhuriyet and Sugören.\n\nHistory\nThe area was part of the kingdom of Colchis but was always vulnerable to invasions, first the Scythians from across the Caucasus, then the Muslim armies led by Habib, son of Caliph Uthman who controlled the area from 853 AD to 1023 when it was conquered by the Byzantines from the Sac Emirate allied to the Abbasids. The Seljuk Turks led by Alp Arslan conquered the area in 1064. With the collapse of the Seljuks, the Artvin area came under the control of the Ildeniz, one of the Anatolian Turkish beyliks\n\nOttoman Sultan Selim I brought it into the Ottoman Empire during his campaign against the Crimea that took place in 1490–1512. Lala Mustafa Pasha made it part of the Childir Eyalet formed in 1578. The area was captured by Russia following the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) and many people of Hopa moved westwards away from the Russian-controlled zone. Hopa was returned as part of the Treaty of Brest Litovsk in 1918 and formally joined Turkey on 14 March 1921. The Sarp border gate was opened on 31 August 1988 with the \"International Road Transport Agreement\"  between Soviet Union and Turkey and gave a big boost to Hopa in trade and tourism.\n\nThere is currently a high rate of cancer in Hopa, attributed to fall-out from the Chernobyl disaster, across the Black Sea from here. Between 2001 and 2004, cancer cases sharply increased in the Black Sea region, especially in Hopa, with 47.9% of all deaths during this time being due to cancer.\n\nEconomy\nThe economy is based on trade, fishing and agriculture, mostly tea, nuts (especially Hazelnuts) and kiwifruit. There are two tea factories, the Black Sea Copper Works, a Thermal Power Plant, the Hopa port and the Hopa Vocational School. It has direct bus connections to Trabzon, Rize, Artvin, Ardahan, Kars, Erzurum and Sarp which go on to Georgia. The Sarp border gate was opened on 31 August 1988 with the \"International Road Transport Agreement\"  between Soviet Union and Turkey and gave a big boost to Hopa in trade and tourism.

{"id": "4104735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic%20adaptation", "title": "Climatic adaptation", "text": "Climatic adaptation refers to adaptations of an organism that are triggered due to the patterns of variation of abiotic factors that determine a specific climate. Annual means, seasonal variation and daily patterns of abiotic factors are properties of a climate where organisms can be adapted to. Changes in behavior, physical structure, internal mechanisms and metabolism are forms of adaptation that is caused by climate properties. Organisms of the same species that occur in different climates can be compared to determine which adaptations are due to climate and which are influenced majorly by other factors. Climatic adaptations limits to adaptations that have been established, characterizing species that live within the specific climate. It is different from climate change adaptations which refers to the ability to adapt to gradual changes of a climate. Once a climate has changed, the climate change adaptation that led to the survival of the specific organisms as a species can be seen as a climatic adaptation. Climatic adaptation is constrained by the genetic variability of the species in question.\n\nClimate patterns\nThe patterns of variation of abiotic factors determine a climate and thus climatic adaptation. There are many different climates around the world, each with its unique patterns. Because of this, the manner of climatic adaptation shows large differences between the climates. A subarctic climate, for instance, shows daylight time and temperature fluctuations as most important factors, while in rainforest climate, the most important factor is characterized by the stable high precipitation rate and high average temperature that doesn't fluctuate a lot. Humid continental climate is marked by seasonal temperature variances which commonly lead to seasonal climate adaptations. Because the variance of these abiotic factors differ depending on the type of climate, differences in the manner of climatic adaptation are expected.\n\nResearch\nResearch on climatic adaptations are mostly aimed on species living in different climates to understand which of these species would have a higher chance to survive climate change, based on their current climatic adaptations. Climates with larger abiotic fluctuations tend to have species with a higher fluctuation tolerance, hence being able to adapt better to climate change. Other research questions involve the clarification of distinct differences between relatable species such as average size and behavioral patterns.\n\nMeasuring Climatic Adaptation\nGenerally, the experimental measure of climate adaptation is conducted by exposing an experimental population to different environmental stimuli.  Successful studies outside of a laboratory setting take place in locations with a variable annual climate.  Areas where annual temperature and weather extremes vary greatly can give insight into the climate adaptability of organisms that live there. Tropical or arctic microclimates, for example, would be ideal settings for experimentation, as annual temperature and weather can vary greatly.  Additionally, laboratory settings could work with certain creatures that have defense mechanisms for certain environmental changes, such as Drosophila'''s chill-coma adaptation.\n\nThe population's performance or behavior can then be plotted against the ecological-climatic factor being tested.  High changes in individual behavior in response to a change in environment point to the conclusion that the population has high climate adaptability.  Adaptation lag can occur when local populations perform significantly better than populations from other environments; however, this lag can be compensated for if the species in question has very high genetic diversity.\n\nExamples\nMany species have varying levels of climatic adaptation.  Differing average annual temperatures can have varying effects on a population's average body temperature, metabolic rate, or body size.  But the actual effect of climatic adaptation depends greatly on the species in question and often the amount of genetic variability within that species.\n\n The bodies of some animals, such as woodrats, are inversely correlated with the mean annual temperature of their environment.  This is an applied example of Bergmann's rule\n Drosophila species occur in both tropical climates, where the temperature is warm, and temperate climates, where the temperature is colder. When both groups of species are brought to a cold induced comatose state, the species of the tropical climates either way don't survive or recover significantly slower from the cold induced comatose state when brought back to room temperature compared to the species of the temperate Drosophila. The ability to recover fast from a cold induced comatose state indicates a climatic adaptation that can be referred to as chill-coma tolerance.\n Many arctic birds and mammals can change their heat dissipation and metabolic rate in response to changes in temperature, as different populations of the same species display different averages depending on their current climate.\n In arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus),'' starvation experiments indicate that the body mass in the arctic fox is regulated according to a seasonally changing set point and not by the availability of food. The basic metabolic rate varies seasonally being lower in winter than summer. The fur thickness can increase 140% from summer to winter.\n\nSee also\n\n Adaptation to global warming, ways social and biological systems can respond to climate change to reduce their vulnerability to its effects\n Climate change (general concept)\n Global warming (recent warming)\n Evolution\n Evolutionary biology\n Melanism, in relation to “industrial melanism”\n\nReferences\n\nEvolution by phenotype"}

He was a member of the Riksråd and served as commander of Bergenhus Fortress.\n\nBackground\nOlav was one of the members of the Skanke family who went on to serve as knights of first the Norwegian and later the Dano-Norwegian kings. He is first mentioned in written sources in 1424, as a royal official in the city of Trondheim. Later on Olav became a wealthy landowner in both Norway and Denmark and was made a knight in 1430, together with his brother Peder. The king who declared the brothers to be knights was Eric of Pomerania. Olav was also a member of the Norwegian Riksråd. \n\nSome time after 1430 Olav married Elisabeth Eskildsdatter from Scania, a lady of high nobility who had the right to use in her coat-of-arms the Royal Lion of Denmark. The marriage of Olav and Elisabeth was one of equal partners, this as Elisabeth personally owned large properties in Eastern Denmark (Scania) and was of strong will and determination. Elisabeth's position in the marriage would be clearly portrayed in the pivotal role she was to play in many of the dramatic events that took place in the latter stages of Olav's life. \n\n \nKing Christopher wanted to improve his relations with the common people of his realm, having come to power following rebellions against his predecessor, Eric, who had allowed foreign officials and bishops to exploit the peoples he ruled over. One of the main efforts of king Christopher to mend these relations was to appoint a commission to process the complaints of the citizens of Norway. The chairman of this commission was Olav Nilsson Skanke. Olav was also appointed chief official of Bergen, the main trading centre and harbour of Norway at the time. \n\nPerhaps chief among the foreign influences that were detested by the Norwegian people at the time was the Hanseatic League. The League operated outside Norwegian law and conducted themselves with indecency and violence. At the time, Olav was in command of Bergenhus Fortress. The citizens of Bergen complained to Olav, but the knight was not able to get support from either the king or the king's government. Acting alone, and with harsh means, Olav punished those among the Hanseatic League who had committed crimes against the city's citizens, thus earning the hatred of the League.\nOlav carried out attacks against both English and Hanseatic shipping. He had several captains under his command, who from the 1440s attacked ships off Western Norway. .\n\nKalmar Union conflicts\nAfter the death of king Christopher in 1448 the Kalmar Union experienced a period of crisis, due to the late king having had no direct heir with Sweden choosing Charles VIII as king while Denmark supported Christian I. Charles VIII was the first, in November 1449 to proclaim himself king of Norway, as Charles I of Norway, but only a few months later, in early 1450, he was deposed by the Dane Christian I who took over the Norwegian throne. At this point war within the union seemed certain, and in response the Swedish national council asked king Charles to withdraw his claim to the Norwegian throne.\n\nCharles would however have nothing of the sort and in 1452 sent his knight Ørian Karlson Skanke from Jemtland to conquer Trondheim, the ancient centre of Norway's kings. Control of this vital city would have greatly strengthened Charles' claim to the throne. The answer from the Danish side came quickly with knight Ørian's own relatives, Olav Nilsson Skanke and his brother Peder, marching up from the south and pushing Ørian out of Trondheim. The same thing happened all over again in 1453 with Ørian seizing Trondheim and Olav and Peder driving him out once more. This second battle finally concluded the conflict over succession and ended the battles between knights of the Skanke family.\n\nDismissal by the King\n\nKnight Olav served King Christian as a privateer during the king's wars against the Hansa. After Christian made peace with the trading alliance, Olav continued to attack Hanseatic ships against the wishes of the king.\nOlav Nilsson Skanke had previously earned the hatred of the Hanseatic League through his conduct as chief official in Bergen. As early as in 1446 the League issued official complaints against Olav at a Bergen town council meeting, and after numerous complaints King Christian I of Denmark yielded to the pressure and in 1453 dismissed Olav. Magnus Green (d. ca. 1473) was made the royal official of Bergen. This dismissal greatly shook Olav who felt unjustly treated after his long and loyal service to the king of the Kalmar Union and to the people of Norway. The knight refused to take this blow lying down and soon mobilized his personal resources and those of his family to regain his former position.\n\nWar on the Hanseatic League\nAfter his dismissal Olav left Bergen and went to his manorial home at Talgø Island in Ryfylke. Here he began to set the wheels in motion towards his response to the Hansa's role in his dismissal. Olav soon equipped several  ships and started again to wage a naval war on the League by attacking and seizing its ships in the North Sea. Operating from a base on the east coast of Scotland, Olav captured a large percentage of the Hanseatic vessels heading for Bergen. Both Olav's wife Elisabeth and his two sons were each commanding ships in the fleet harrying the Hansa vessels. Elisabeth was especially successful and rapidly became renowned all over Northern Europe for her wisdom and bravery.\n\nOlav Nilsson takes Älvsborg\n\nSoon the campaign against the League became so successful that Olav expanded it to the coast of Sweden, attacking the Swedes at every weak point he could find. In one of his attacks Olav managed to capture the Swedish fortress of Älvsborg in 1455 and garrison it with his own loyal men. This fortress was of vital importance to the Swedes due to its strategic location commanding the shipping routes between Denmark and Norway. In addition to occupying this favorable blocking position Ãlvsborg was also the major Swedish strongpoint in the small strip of land the Swedes had controlled since the mid-13th century, separating the Danish province of Halland from the Norwegian Bohuslen. The small coastal area of the province Västergötland was up until the 1658 Treaty of Roskilde Sweden's only access to the Skagerrak and the North Sea. \n\nAt the time the relationship between Denmark and Sweden was very tense, and it was in this atmosphere that Olav offered to hand over the fortress to the Danes. Olav made it clear that he would only surrender the fortress into Danish hands if he was reinstituted to his former position in Bergen. If these conditions were not met he would hand Älvsborg back to the Swedes. In effect, Olav committed an act of extortion against the Danish Crown. As Ãlvsborg was of to great importance in the rivalry between Sweden and Denmark,  the Danish King Christian I had no choice but to agree to the vigilante knight's demands.\n\nReturn to Bergen and death\nFollowing Olav's success in forcing the Danish Crown into restoring him to his former position in Bergen he and his family returned to the city in a triumphant manner. Olav was again given command of the Bergenhus Fortress.\nShortly after Olav's return to Bergen,  Hanseatic merchants attacked him at Munkeliv Abbey. In the attack which destroyed the abbey, Olav was killed  together with Leif Thor Olafsson, Bishop of Bergen and about 60 other Norwegians. Olav's son was one of those who died with him.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n \n \n\n1455 deaths\nYear of birth unknown\nNorwegian military personnel killed in action\nNorwegian pirates\nPrivateers\n15th-century Norwegian nobility\nArtists from Bergen"}

He was married to Fannie E. Abbott. He became a wealthy businessman in the American Mid-West. He was well versed in arts and science. After Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity, Abbott attempted to explain it in a newspaper article.\n\nAs a magician, he performed for invited guests in his private theater he built at his home from 1907 until he died. There he demonstrated his Talking Teakettle (around 1907, decades before miniature radio electronics came into use) and Talking Vase (in 1909). Abbott built his work of magic and deception on the devious principles he learned from spirit mediums. Many of the greats in magic– Kellar, Thurston, Horace Goldin, Theo Bamberg, Ching Ling Foo, Blackstone and Houdini among others–made pilgrimages to Omaha Field Club neighborhood \"Mystery House\" to be dumbfounded and to learn.\n\nAbbott was a friend of the magician Harry Houdini. His most well known work was Behind the Scenes with the Mediums published in 1907, which went through several editions.\n\nIn 1934, Abbott died of diabetes in Omaha. His burial was at Westlawn-Hillcrest Memorial Park, Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nAbbott wrote a second full-length book, describing not only the séances given in his home but many magical feats which had astounded top professional performers; he died before it could be published, and for a long time the manuscript could not be found. When the Abbott home was sold in 1936, the manuscript was thought to be lost. It was discovered by Walter Graham and published as David P.

{"id": "4104773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0dil", "title": "İdil", "text": "İdil (, or Beth Zabday, , ) is a city and seat of the İdil District of the Şırnak Province in Turkey. It is located in the historical region of Tur Abdin.\n\nIn the city, there is a Syriac Orthodox Church of the Mother of God (, ).\n\nThe town had a population of 30,271 in 2021 and is composed of Kurds of the Domanan, Dorikan, Harunan, Meman and Omerkan tribes. There is moreover a small Assyrian minority.\n\nNeighborhoods \nThe town is divided into the six neighborhoods of Aşağı, Atakent, Turgut Özal, Yeni and Yukarı.\n\nHistory\nAzakh (today called İdil) is identified as the town of Ashikhu, or Asiḫu, which is earliest attested in an administrative note from the governor's archive at Tell Halaf, during the reign of Adad-nirari III, King of Assyria, in the late 9th and early 8th century BC. Azakh was later conflated with the neighbouring city of Bezabde, and led to its alternative Syriac name Beth Zabday.\n\nOttoman Empire \nMohammed Paşa, Emir of Rowanduz, took advantage of the disruption caused to the Ottoman Empire by the Egyptian invasion of Syria in 1831–1832 to expand his realm, and besieged Azakh in 1834. The emir surrendered, however, upon the arrival of a large Ottoman army under the leadership of Reşid Mehmed Pasha. The village was attacked again later by Bedir Khan Beg, Emir of Bohtan, in 1847, resulting in the death of Cyril George, Syriac Orthodox Archbishop of Azakh, a priest, and eight congregants.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the village had a population of 1000, and was inhabited by Arabic-speaking Syriac Orthodox and Syriac Catholic Assyrians, some of whom emigrated to Brazil in 1914. Amidst the Assyrian genocide, in July 1915, refugees from the villages of Esfes, Kefshenne, Kufakh, Babqqa, and Khaddel fled to Azakh. The village was subsequently attacked by Kurdish tribesmen from mid-August until their withdrawal on 9 September. An expeditionary force of approximately 8000 Ottoman soldiers and Kurdish auxiliaries, led jointly by Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter and Ömer Naci, was diverted from its original task to conduct anti-Russian operations in Iran to besiege Azakh, and arrived in late October. Scheubner-Richter refused to involve Germans in the siege, and the first attack began on 7 November. After subsequent attacks, and an Assyrian counter-attack on 14 November, the Turkish army retreated on 21 November.\n\nRepublic of Turkey \nThe village became the seat of a bucak (subdistrict) of Cizre in 1924. In the following year, a number of villagers emigrated to Brazil, at which time 100 Assyrians were deported from Azakh. In the aftermath of the failure of the Kurdish Sheikh Said rebellion, the Turkish government enacted oppressive measures, thus in 1926 the inhabitants of Azakh were accused of complicity in the rebellion, and of possession of arms received from the British government. The Turkish authorities alleged that the village's men had served in the British Iraq Levies on the basis of the discovery of British rifles and permits to carry arms in English and Arabic in Azakh. The population was thus disarmed after the arrival of 1500 Turkish soldiers, and 257 or 357 men from Azakh and neighbouring villages, including notables and three priests, were accused of treason, arrested, and imprisoned at Cizre. The Assyrians of Azakh were deemed unsuitable for Turkification by the Turkish government, and as a result aimed to exterminate those who had survived the genocide, whereby those who had been arrested were beaten and denied food whilst imprisoned. They were later transferred to Midyat, where most were released in August 1926, whilst notables remained imprisoned, who were transferred to Harpoot until eventually released after five more months.\n\nAssyrians from Azakh emigrated to Ain Diwar and Al-Malikiyah in northeastern Syria in the early 1930s after the construction of French military bases. The village was elevated to district in 1937, upon which it was officially renamed İdil. The village was inhabited by 3500 Assyrians in 1964. As a result of the Cypriot crisis of 1963-1964, Assyrians of İdil were the victim of anti-Christian riots. The village was exclusively populated by Christian Assyrians until the mid-1970s; this was in part due to the prohibition of sale of property to Muslim Kurds by Mayor Şükrü Tutuş. Efforts to encroach on the Assyrian population resulted in the construction of social housing for Kurds in the village, who consequently amounted to 10% of the population, and the election of Abdurrahman Abay, chief of the Kurdish Kecan tribe, as mayor in 1979 with the aid of the Turkish authorities, including the military commander, judge, and district governor. Abay alleged that he received congratulations via telegram from Anwar Sadat, President of Egypt, for the \"Muslim conquest of Idil\". This led the Assyrian population to decline in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nAfter their forced eviction by the Turkish army on 20 November 1993, a number of Assyrian refugees from Hassana fled to İdil. On 9 January 1994, Melke Tok, priest of Miden, was abducted whilst en route from İdil to Bsorino. The priest was later released after negotiations, and attested that, whilst in captivity, he was buried alive and pressured into converting to Islam. The murder of former mayor Şükrü Tutuş on 17 June 1994 led the remaining Christian population of several hundred people to seek asylum in Western Europe, and was followed by the Kurdish repopulation of the village. Assyrians later returned, but by 2015 only 50 Assyrians inhabited the city.\n\nThe eruption of violence in early 2016 led all but two Assyrians to flee İdil, as well as an estimated three thousand people, and a curfew was imposed on 16 February. The Turkish army began operations in the city on 18 February and claimed to have killed at least 47 PKK militants by 25 February. The curfew was partially lifted on 31 March and the refugees returned to İdil, including at least four Assyrian families. In late July 2019, Assyrian properties in the district were struck by suspected arson attacks. As of September 2020, only 23 Assyrians inhabit İdil.\n\nGovernment\n\nMayors\n\nMayor Mehmet Muhdi Arslan and deputy mayor Nevin Girasun were suspended on 20 September 2016 following their arrest in August on suspicion of aiding and abetting the PKK, and Kaymakam (district governor) Ersin Tepeli was appointed as trustee on the following day.\n\nNotable people\nJacques Behnan Hindo (b. 1941), Syriac Catholic Archbishop of Al-Hasakah-Nisibis.\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nTur Abdin\nPopulated places in İdil District\nAssyrian communities in Turkey\nKurdish settlements in Mardin Province\nPlaces of the Assyrian genocide\nPopulated places in ancient Upper Mesopotamia\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey"}

{"id": "4104791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor%20Pasmore", "title": "Victor Pasmore", "text": "Edwin John Victor Pasmore, CH, CBE (3 December 190823 January 1998) was a British artist. He pioneered the development of abstract art in Britain in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nEarly life\nPasmore was born in Chelsham, Surrey, on 3 December 1908. He studied at Summer Fields School in Oxford and Harrow in west London, but with the death of his father in 1927 he was forced to take an administrative job at the London County Council. He studied painting part-time at the Central School of Art and was associated with the formation of the Euston Road School. After experimenting with abstraction, Pasmore worked for a time in a lyrical figurative style, painting views of the River Thames from Hammersmith much in the style of Turner and Whistler.\n\nIn the Second World War, Pasmore was a conscientious objector. Having been refused recognition by his Local Tribunal, he was called up for military service in 1942.  He refused orders and was court martialled and sentenced to 123 days imprisonment. The sentence qualified him to go to the Appellate Tribunal in Edinburgh, which allowed him unconditional exemption from military service.\n\nArtistic career\n\nThe figurative years: 1927–1947 \nOne of the first exhibitions in which his works feature was held at the Zwemmer gallery, London 1934. His works were influenced by Monet and Cézanne.\n\nThe break into abstraction (1948–1954) \nHis break into abstract art was inspired by the artists Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee. Their writings feature nature and the creation of a dynamic harmony in art which stood for the future harmony of society.\n\nBeginning in 1947, he developed a purely abstract style under the influence of Ben Nicholson and other artists associated with Circle, becoming a pioneering figure of the revival of interest in Constructivism in Britain following the War. Pasmore's abstract work, often in collage and construction of reliefs, pioneered the use of new materials and was sometimes on a large architectural scale. Herbert Read described Pasmore's new style as \"The most revolutionary event in post-war British art\".\n\nIn 1950, he was commissioned to design an abstract mural for a bus depot in Kingston upon Thames and the following year Pasmore contributed a mural to the Festival of Britain that promoted a number of the British Constructivists.\n\nPasmore was a supporter of fellow artist Richard Hamilton, giving him a teaching job in Newcastle and contributing a constructivist structure to the exhibition \"This Is Tomorrow\" in collaboration with Ernő Goldfinger and Helen Phillips. Pasmore was commissioned to make a mural for the new Newcastle Civic Centre. His interest in the synthesis of art and architecture was given free hand when he was appointed Consulting Director of Architectural Design for Peterlee development corporation in 1955. Pasmore's choices in this area proved controversial; the centerpiece of the town design became an abstract public art structure of his design, the Apollo Pavilion. The structure became the focus for local criticism over the failures of the Development Corporation but Pasmore remained a defender of his work, returning to the town to face critics of the Pavilion at a public meeting in 1982. After many years of neglect the work was restored in 2009 with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.\n\nPasmore represented Britain at the 1961 Venice Biennale, was participating artist at the Documenta II 1959 in Kassel and was a trustee of the Tate Gallery, donating a number of works to the collection.  He gave a lecture on J.M.W. Turner as 'first of the moderns' to the Turner Society, of which he was elected a vice president in 1975.\n\nTeaching: 1937–1961 \nPasmore was a leading figure in the promotion of abstract art and reform of the fine art education system. From 1943–1949, he taught at Camberwell School of Art where one of his students was Terry Frost whom he advised not to bother with the School's formal teaching and to instead study the works in the National Gallery.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1954 Pasmore taught at the Central School of Art.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1961 he was Master of Painting in the Fine Art Department Durham University, Kings College Newcastle upon Tyne, (now Newcastle University). There he developed a radical art and design course inspired by the 'basic course' of the Bauhaus that became the model for higher arts education across the UK. He was succeeded by Richard Hamilton.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1940, he married the artist Wendy Blood. They had two children, a son and a daughter. He moved to Malta in 1966. He died in Gudja, Malta, on 23 January 1998, aged 89.\n\nLegacy \nOn 3 November 2014, the Central Bank of Malta, in collaboration with the Victor Pasmore Foundation, inaugurated the Victor Pasmore Gallery in the Central Bank's premises at the Polverista Gallery. This gallery houses a permanent exhibition of works discovered in Pasmore's home in Gudja, Malta and also in his residence in Blackheath, London. The exhibition consists primarily of paintings and constructions created while the artist lived in Malta.\n\nSee also \n\n Abstract painting - 1998 painting by Pasmore\n\nReferences\n\nSources\nThe Times, 1 September 1942.\n\nFurther reading\n Grieve, Alastair, Constructed Abstract Art in England: A Neglected Avant-Garde, Yale University Press, 2005. \n Grieve, Alastair (editor), Victor Pasmore: Towards a New Reality, Tate Publishing, 2010. \n Bowness, Alan and Lambertini, Luigi, Victor Pasmore: With a Catalogue Raisonne of Paintings, Constructions and Graphics, 1926-79, Thames & Hudson, 1980.\n\nExternal links \n \n Central Bank of Malta\n Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti\n\n1908 births\n1998 deaths\nAbstract painters\nPeople from Tandridge (district)\nPeople educated at Harrow School\nPeople educated at Summer Fields School\n20th-century English painters\nEnglish male painters\nArchitects from Surrey\nBritish conscientious objectors\nAcademics of Durham University\nAlumni of the Central School of Art and Design\nAcademics of Camberwell College of Arts\n20th-century English architects\nMembers of the Order of the Companions of Honour\nCommanders of the Order of the British Empire\nRoyal Academicians\n20th-century English male artists"}

{"id": "4104802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Masque%20of%20Blackness", "title": "The Masque of Blackness", "text": "The Masque of Blackness was an early Jacobean era masque, first performed at the Stuart Court in the Banqueting Hall of Whitehall Palace on Twelfth Night, 6 January 1605. It was written by Ben Jonson at the request of Anne of Denmark, the queen consort of King James I, who wished the masquers to be disguised as Africans. Anne was one of the performers in the masque along with her court ladies, all of whom appeared in blackface makeup. In a ceremony earlier on the day, Prince Charles, Anne's second son (who was still in Scotland at Dunfermline Palace) was given the title of Duke of York.\n\nPlot and themes\nThe plot of the masque follows the ladies arriving at the royal court to be \"cleansed\" of their blackness by King James; a stage direction that was impossible to fulfill on stage. They had been instructed by a riddle to seek the land \"Britannia\". The theme of the masque was a commentary on the Jacobean debate on the Union and the disparate identities of the people of Britain. The Masque of Beauty was written as a sequel to The Masque of Blackness, and originally intended for the following holiday season. It was displaced by Hymenaei, the masque for the wedding of the Earl of Essex and Frances Howard. Beauty was finally performed in 1608.\n\nDesign\nThe sets, costumes, and stage effects were designed by Inigo Jones; Blackness was the first of many masques for the Stuart Court on which Jonson and Jones would collaborate. The music for Blackness was composed by Alfonso Ferrabosco.\n\nJones designed a raised and mobile stage for the masque, forty feet square and four feet off the floor; this was employed for many subsequent masques. The stage contained inner space for the machines that produced stage effects and the technicians who operated them. The King was often stilling on a stool, resembling the sun. Blackness introduced effects that Jones would repeat with variation throughout his career as a stage designer: it opened with a tempestuous seascape, simulated by flowing and billowing cloths.\n\nThe opening stormy sea was populated with six blue-haired merman-like tritons. The gods Oceanus (\"blue\") and Niger (black) entered, mounted upon giant seahorses. The twelve daughters of Niger, played by the Queen and her ladies in waiting, entered in the company of a dozen nymphs of Oceanus as torchbearers; the ladies of the Court were dressed in tones of silver and azure to contrast with the blackness of the makeup, with pearls and feathers in their hair, while the torchbearers, in green doublets with gold puffed sleeves, had their faces, hands, and hair dyed blue. The ladies rode in a great hollow seashell, which seemed to float upon and move with the waves, and was accompanied by six large sea monsters carrying more torchbearers. (With Blackness as with many subsequent masques designed by Jones, one of the aspects of the show most commented upon by witnesses was the dazzling intensity of light involved...which inevitably says something about the normal conditions of life in the Jacobean era.)\n\nPlot summary\nThe text begins with Niger talking to his father Oceanus. Oceanus asks him why he has left his usual eastward course and flowed westward, into the Atlantic. Niger tells him that he has come to request help. Niger's daughters are upset because they thought themselves to be the most beautiful goddesses in the world, only to discover that paleness is thought more attractive  - and so no longer feel beautiful. The moon goddess, Aethiopia, tells the daughters that, if they can find a country whose name ends in \"tannia\", they will be beautiful once more.\n\nThe daughters try desperately to find the country whose name ends in \"tannia\", travelling as far as Mauritania (North Africa), Lusitania (Portugal), and Aquitania (France) in their quest. Despondent at their lack of success they pray once more to Aethiopia, who tells them that the country is Britannia and that they should seek out its sun-like king, who has the power to bleach their black complexions white. Aethiopia further advises the daughters that once a month for the next year, they should bathe in sea-dew and, thus prepared, at the same time next year, they should appear before the king again, whereupon his light will make them beautiful and white.\n\nCast\nThe principal cast of the masque:\n\nQueen Anne................Euphoris\nCountess of Bedford........Aglaia\nLady Herbert...............Diaphane\nCountess of Derby.....Eucampse\nLady Rich........................Ocyte\nCountess of Suffolk.......Kathare\n\nLady Bevill.........................Notis\nLady Effingham...........Psychrote\nLady Elizabeth Howard....Glycyte\nLady Susan Vere.............Malacia\nLady Mary Wroth...............Baryte\nLady Walsingham.........Periphere\n\nA newsletter from court described the cast of the \"Queen's mask\" in December 1604, noting that three women were excused because of illness, the Countess of Nottingham, the Countess of Richmond who had measles, and the Countess of Northumberland. Lady Hatton was not invited to perform and left court. \"Lady Herbert\" was Anne Herbert, a daughter of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke and Mary Sidney.\n\nResponses\nThe masque was controversial in its day, in part for the production's use of body paint instead of masks to simulate dark skin. One observer, Sir Dudley Carleton expressed his displeasure with the play as such:\n\nInstead of Vizzards, their Faces, and Arms up to the Elbows, were painted black, which was a Disguise sufficient, for they were hard to be known; ... and you cannot imagine a more ugly Sight, than a Troop of lean-cheek'd Moors.\n\nCarleton also made a topical joke, comparing the huge sea-monsters that flanked the shell that housed the nymphs with an unusual sighting of a seal in the Thames at Isleworth, \"it came in company with the Sea-fish that drew in our Lady-Moors, and carried a Waiting Gentlewoman and some baggage!\".\n\nAnother writer described the masque dancers' appearance and the expense; \"the Queen and some dozen ladies all paynted like Blackamores, face and neck bare, and for the rest strangely attired in Barbaresque mantells to the halfe legge, having buskins all to be sett with jewells, ... it took the King betweene 4 or £5,000 to execute to Queen's fancy\".\n\nA poem, perhaps by John Donne or Henry Goodere, was addressed to one of the masquers, possibly Lucy, Countess of Bedford. It begins, \"Why chose shee black; was it that in whitenes, She did Leda equall\".\n\nThe make-up used could not be quickly removed, so a metamorphosis from black to white was not staged. Anne of Denmark's apothecary John Wolfgang Rumler is known to have devised a more easily removeable blackface make-up for a masque in 1621, The Gypsies Metamorphosed.\n\nThe masque was expensive, costing £3000. It caused consternation among some English observers due to the perceived impropriety of the performance. Controversy also stemmed from the predominant role of female actresses playing what were considered traditionally male roles.\n\nThe texts of The Masque of Blackness and The Masque of Beauty were published together in quarto form in 1608, by the bookseller Thomas Thorpe; they were reprinted in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616.\n\nModern criticism\nThe representation of African people in court masques had precedents both in England and Scotland. Anne of Denmark had African servants. There was a masque involving blackface at the coronation of Christian IV of Denmark in 1596, witnessed by Anne of Denmark's brother, the Duke of Holstein and perhaps, by Inigo Jones.\n\nKim F. Hall draws attention to The Masque of Blackness and the documented reactions of its audience, in the context of the \"growth of actual contact with Africans, Native Americans, and other ethnically different foreigners\" and a \"collision of the dark lady tradition with the actual African difference encountered in the quest for empire\". A \"pride in the revival of ancient Britain is continually yoked to the glorification of whiteness\". For Bernadette Andrea the masque reveals \"complicity with an emerging institutional racism as England's increasing investment in the transatlantic slave trade underwrote its imperialist expansion in to the Americas\".\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Gurr, Andrew.

{"id": "4104815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne%27s%20thread%20%28logic%29", "title": "Ariadne's thread (logic)", "text": "Ariadne's thread, named for the legend of Ariadne, is solving a problem which has multiple apparent ways to proceed—such as a physical maze, a logic puzzle, or an ethical dilemma—through an exhaustive application of logic to all available routes. It is the particular method used that is able to follow completely through to trace steps or take point by point a series of found truths in a contingent, ordered search that reaches an end position. This process can take the form of a mental record, a physical marking, or even a philosophical debate; it is the process itself that assumes the name.\n\nImplementation\nThe key element to applying Ariadne's thread to a problem is the creation and maintenance of a record—physical or otherwise—of the problem's available and exhausted options at all times. This record is referred to as the \"thread\", regardless of its actual medium. The purpose the record serves is to permit backtracking—that is, reversing earlier decisions and trying alternatives. Given the record, applying the algorithm is straightforward:\n\n At any moment that there is a choice to be made, make one arbitrarily from those not already marked as failures, and follow it logically as far as possible.\n If a contradiction results, back up to the last decision made, mark it as a failure, and try another decision at the same point. If no other options exist there, back up to the last place in the record that does have options, mark the failure at that level, and proceed onward.\n\nThis algorithm will terminate upon either finding a solution or marking all initial choices as failures; in the latter case, there is no solution. If a thorough examination is desired even though a solution has been found, one can revert to the previous decision, mark the success, and continue on as if a solution were never found; the algorithm will exhaust all decisions and find all solutions.\n\nDistinction from trial and error\nThe terms \"Ariadne's thread\" and \"trial and error\" are often used interchangeably, which is not necessarily correct. They have two distinctive differences:\n\n \"Trial and error\" implies that each \"trial\" yields some particular value to be studied and improved upon, removing \"errors\" from each iteration to enhance the quality of future trials. Ariadne's thread has no such mechanism, and hence all decisions made are arbitrary. For example, the scientific method is trial and error; puzzle-solving is Ariadne's thread.\n Trial-and-error approaches are rarely concerned with how many solutions may exist to a problem, and indeed often assume only one correct solution exists. Ariadne's thread makes no such assumption, and is capable of locating all possible solutions to a purely logical problem.\n\nIn short, trial and error approaches a desired solution; Ariadne's thread blindly exhausts the search space completely, finding any and all solutions. Each has its appropriate distinct uses. They can be employed in tandem—for example, although the editing of a Wikipedia article is arguably a trial-and-error process (given how in theory it approaches an ideal state), article histories provide the record for which Ariadne's thread may be applied, reverting detrimental edits and restoring the article back to the most recent error-free version, from which other options may be attempted.\n\nApplications\nObviously, Ariadne's thread may be applied to the solving of mazes in the same manner as the legend; an actual thread can be used as the record, or chalk or a similar marker can be applied to label passages. If the maze is on paper, the thread may well be a pencil.\n\nLogic problems of all natures may be resolved via Ariadne's thread, the maze being but an example. At present, it is most prominently applied to Sudoku puzzles, used to attempt values for as-yet-unsolved cells. The medium of the thread for puzzle-solving can vary widely, from a pencil to numbered chits to a computer program, but all accomplish the same task. Note that as the compilation of Ariadne's thread is an inductive process, and due to its exhaustiveness leaves no room for actual study, it is largely frowned upon as a solving method, to be employed only as a last resort when deductive methods fail.\n\nArtificial intelligence is heavily dependent upon Ariadne's thread when it comes to game-playing, most notably in programs which play chess; the possible moves are the decisions, game-winning states the solutions, and game-losing states failures. Due to the massive depth of many games, most algorithms cannot afford to apply Ariadne's thread entirely on every move due to time constraints, and therefore work in tandem with a heuristic that evaluates game states and limits a breadth-first search only to those that are most likely to be beneficial, a trial-and-error process.\n\nEven circumstances where the concept of \"solution\" is not so well defined have had Ariadne's thread applied to them, such as navigating the World Wide Web, making sense of patent law, and in philosophy; \"Ariadne's Thread\" is a popular name for websites of many purposes, but primarily for those that feature philosophical or ethical debate.\n\nSee also\nBrute-force search\nDepth-first search\nLabyrinth\nDeductive reasoning\nComputer chess\nJ.

Gurgi is the hero Taran's faithful companion, appearing in all five books.\n\nProfile \n\nHe is described as being a cross between man and beast, having long arms, covered with fur and leaves, and ever hungry but really \"just a sort of a, kind of a thing\". His demeanor is extremely loyal and caring, almost to a fault. His manner of speech is filled with rhymed pairs of words (\"crunchings and munchings\", \"smackings and whackings\", \"sneakings and peekings\", etc.), and redundant phrases (\"see with lookings!\"); he refers to himself in the third person. Gurgi is humble and loyal toward his human companions, at first submitting even to Taran as a \"noble lord\".\n\nAppearances\n\nGurgi is one of the few characters to appear in all five books of the series, the others being Taran, Fflewddur, Dallben and Coll.\n\nIn The Book of Three, Taran first meets Gurgi in his quest to locate Hen-Wen, the oracular pig. At first, Taran is disdainful of Gurgi, believing him to be more of a nuisance than anything else. By the end of the book, he learns the value of true companionship.\n\nIn The Black Cauldron, Gurgi, along with Princess Eilonwy, sneakily follows the Companions to the Black Gate of Annuvin. Gurgi would accompany the Companions to the Marshes of Morva and eventually be the one to find the Black Cauldron.\n\nIn The Castle of Llyr, Gurgi accompanies Taran in escorting the Princess Eilonwy to the Isle of Mona and faces all sorts of dangers when she is kidnapped by a foe long thought dead.\n\nIn Taran Wanderer, Gurgi loyally follows Taran on what might be the most important quest of his life, the search for his true identity (who his parents were, etc.), and proves to be a true friend.\n\nIn The High King, Gurgi's bravery is proven from beginning to end and when all is said and done, he must make the hardest choice of all.\n\nOrigins \n\nAccording to a 1999 publisher's note, quoting Alexander on The Chronicles, \"'The people in it were born, like most children, at unlikely and inconvenient times.. Gurgi, for example, appeared in the predawn hours. ... Suddenly there he was, with his groanings and moanings, looking like a disordered owl's nest.\"\n\nAccording to Alexander, nearly all of the proper names in Prydain are from Welsh myth or history, perhaps all except Eilonwy and Taran. There are several characters named Gurgi in Welsh legend, the most important of whom was Peredur's brother.\n\nDisney \n\nIn Disney's animated version of The Black Cauldron, Gurgi is portrayed as a small anthropomorphic dog-like creature. The voice was provided by actor/impressionist John Byner.\n\nThere used to be a restaurant in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom named after Gurgi, Gurgi's Munchies and Crunchies, which closed in 1993. To this date it has been one of only two vendor/attraction with a Black Cauldron theme at any Disney theme park. The other was an attraction; \"Cinderella Castle Mystery Tour\" at Tokyo Disneyland, which has also since closed in 2006.\n\nThe Disney version of Gurgi also appears in the world-building video game Disney Magic Kingdoms as a playable character to unlock for a limited time.\n\nAdditional information \n\nThe cover on one edition of The Black Cauldron shows Gurgi looking like a raggedy humanoid with bushy hair and thin limbs, almost like a starving vagrant. Another has him illustrated similar to a Chimpanzee.\nGurgi possesses a magical wallet, a gift from Prince Gwydion, which provides an indefinite supply of nourishing, though somewhat tasteless and dry food.\nWhile his mount has no name per se, he is often seen riding a shaggy pony.\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n\nFictional humanoids\nLiterary characters introduced in 1964\nThe Chronicles of Prydain characters\nFictional illeists"}

At Calvet he worked under the chemical engineer Jean Ribéreau-Gayon, and they developed methods of analysing the wines that were to be purchased. In 1946, Peynaud completed his Doctorate at the University of Bordeaux and joined its faculty as a lecturer. Ribéreau-Gayon at this time was also teaching at the University, and the two shifted their previous focus of problems faced by Calvet to the problems faced by the winemakers themselves.\n\nWhile at the University of Bordeaux, where he became a professor of oenology, Peynaud worked at providing scientific explanations for many problems encountered in the process of winemaking. He convinced the wineries to begin picking of grapes at vineyards up to two weeks later than usual, and to complete the picking as quickly as possible. The practice of also picking underripe or rotten grapes was abandoned, so that the selected fruit arriving at the winery was of the best possible quality.\n\nPeynaud introduced crushing and fermenting fruit in separate batches based on vine age, vineyard location, or any other factor that resulted in fruit of differing qualities in order to control tannin extraction. He then applied the cool fermentations used in Champagne to still white Bordeaux in order to control fermentation temperatures.\n\nBecause he proposed methods that ran counter to many traditions, in the 1950s and 1960s, skeptics would use the term \"Peynaudization\" of Bordeaux, but as his advice usually produced superior wines, criticism came to an end.\n\nPeynaud considered the control of malolactic fermentation to be one of his most important contributions to winemaking. It was commonly believed that malolactic fermentation was a sickness. He helped the wineries realize that they needed to encourage and control malolactic fermentation. He also stated, \"Using only the very best grapes is a new phenomenon,\" considering this \"the crowning achievement of [his] work.\"\n\nPeynaud was the Decanter Man of the Year in 1990.

{"id": "4104862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemileia%20vastatrix", "title": "Hemileia vastatrix", "text": "Hemileia vastatrix is a multicellular basidiomycete fungus of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales) that causes coffee leaf rust (CLR), a disease affecting the coffee plant. Coffee serves as the obligate host of coffee rust, that is, the rust must have access to and come into physical contact with coffee (Coffea sp.) in order to survive.\n\nCLR is one of the most economically important diseases of coffee, worldwide. Previous epidemics have destroyed coffee production of entire countries. In more recent history, an epidemic in Central America in 2012 reduced the region's coffee output by 16%.\n\nThe primary pathological mechanism of the fungus is a reduction in the plant's ability to derive energy through photosynthesis by covering the leaves with fungus spores and/or causing leaves to drop from the plant. The reduction in photosynthetic ability (plant's metabolism) results in a reduction in quantity and quality of flower and fruit production, which ultimately reduces the beverage quality.\n\nAppearance\n\nThe mycelium with uredinia looks yellow-orange and powdery, and appears on the underside of leaves as points ~0.1 mm in diameter. Young lesions appear as chlorotic or pale yellow spots some millimetres in diameter, the older being a few centimetres in diameter. Hyphae are club-shaped with tips bearing numerous pedicels on which clusters of urediniospores are produced.\n\nTelia are pale yellowish teliospores often produced in uredinia; teliospores more or less spherical to limoniform, 26–40 × 20–30 µm in diameter, wall hyaline to yellowish, smooth, 1 µm thick, thicker at the apex, pedicel hyaline.\n\nUrediniospores are more or less reniform, 26–40 × 18-28 µm, with hyaline to pale yellowish wall, 1–2 µm thick, strongly warted on the convex side, smooth on the straight or concave side, warts frequently longer (3–7 µm) on spore edges.\n\nThere have been no known reports of a host capable of supporting an aecial stage of the fungus.\n\nLife cycle\nHemileias life cycle begins with the germination of uredospores through germ pores in the spore. It mainly attacks the leaves and is only rarely found on young stems and fruit. Appressoria are produced, which in turn produce vesicles, from which entry into the substomatal cavity is gained. Within 24–48 hours, infection is completed. After successful infection, the leaf blade is colonized and sporulation will occur through the stomata. One lesion produces 4–6 spore crops over a 3–5 month period releasing 300–400,000 spores.\n\nThere is currently no known alternate host nor reported cases of infection by basidiospores of H. vastatrix, yet the fungus is able to overcome resistance by plants and scientists do not know exactly how. The predominant hypothesis is that H. vastatrix is heteroecious, completing its life cycle on an alternate host plant which has not yet been found. An alternative hypothesis is that H. vastatrix actually represents an early-diverging autoecious rust, in which the teliospores are non-functional and vestigial, and the sexual life cycle is completed by the urediniospores. Hidden meiosis and sexual reproduction (cryptosexuality) have been found within the generally asexual urediniospores. This finding may explain why new physiological races have arisen so often and so quickly in H. vastatrix.\n\nControl\n\nRecent studies and research papers have shown that CLR is under-researched compared to pathogens of other cash crops and that there are many factors that can influence the incidence and severity of the disease. Therefore, an integrated approach that includes genetic, chemical, and cultural controls is the best course of action.\n\nResistant cultivars\nThe most effective and durable strategy against CLR is the use of resistant cultivars. This has a number of benefits beyond disease control and can include the reduction in use of agrochemicals as control. A reduction in chemical application also has positive economic effects for farmers by reducing the cost of production. However, in lieu of deploying new, resistant plant stock, or in the interim between initiation of a renewal program and complete renewal, other methods of control are available.\n\nProfessional research and breeding programs such as CIRAD are developing F1 hybrid coffee trees such as Starmaya that have broad genetic resistance to CLR as well as good yield and cup quality, with research showing that F1 hybrids have higher yields and cup quality than conventional Coffea arabica cultivars. Research is also being done on how to democratize the use of F1 hybrids by smallholder coffee farmers who too often can not afford to utilize F1 hybrids. For example, Starmaya is the first F1 hybrid coffee tree that can be propagated in a seed garden rather than the more complicated and expensive process of somatic embryogenesis.\n\nChemicals\n\nThere are social, environmental, and economic concerns associated with any chemical control of plant diseases and some of these have a more direct and immediate impact than others on a farmer's decision to use chemicals. The use of chemicals must first and foremost make economic sense, and the cost of their use can be as much as 50% of the total cost of production. For smallholder farmers, this can be cost-prohibitive. Copper-based fungicides, such as Bordeaux mixture, have proven to be effective and economical, and work best when applied at inoculum levels below 10%.\n\nTypically copper-based mixtures are used as preventative measures and systemic fungicides are used as curative measures.\n\nBy reducing disease incidence, chemical control can help mitigate the reduction in fruit quality and quantity that is caused by the disease.\n\nCultural\n\nThe extended presence of water on the leaves allows H vastatrix to infect the plant more easily and therefore cultural methods can be directed at reducing the time and the amount of water that remains on leaves. Cultural methods such as pruning branches to allow more air circulation and light penetration can help dry the moisture on the leaves. Increasing spacing between rows and preventing weed growth also allows for more air circulation and light penetration.\n\nPlant nutrition\n\nThe correct amount of plant nutrients can also play a role in host resistance. Adequate nutrition allows the plant's natural, biochemical defenses to perform at optimal levels. For example, nitrogen and potassium are two critical, macronutrients that assist a coffee tree to resist infection. Nitrogen is a critical component of chlorophyll, which is central to photosynthesis. Potassium helps to increase the thickness of a leaf's epidermis, which acts as a barrier to pathogen attack. It also aids in recovery of tissues after an attack by H. vastatrix.\n\nPruning\n\nExperiments have shown that removal of infected leaves can possibly reduce the final amount of the disease by a significant amount.\n\nFruit thinning\n\nFruit thinning combined with chemical application (cyproconazole and epoxiconazole for example) can increase effective control.\n\nShade\n\nThere is a complex interaction between shade, meteorological effects such as rainfall or dry periods, and aerial dispersal of rust. Researchers have found that shade may suppress spore dispersal under dry conditions but assist spore dispersal during wet conditions. The researchers acknowledge the need for further research on the topic.\n\nEcology\nHemileia vastatrix is an obligate parasite that lives mainly on the plants of genus Coffea but is also capable of invading Arabidopsis thaliana but does not develop haustoria.\n\nThe rust needs suitable temperatures to develop (between 16 °C and 28 °C). High altitude plantations are generally colder, so inoculum will not develop as easily as in plantations located in warmer regions. The presence of free water is required for infection to be completed. Loss of moisture after germination starts inhibits the whole infection process.\n\nSporulation is most influenced by temperature, humidity, and host resistance. The colonization process is not dependent on leaf wetness but is influenced greatly by temperature and by plant resistance. The main effect of temperature is to determine the length of time for the colonization process (incubation period).\n\nHemileia vastatrix has two fungal parasites, Verticillium haemiliae and Verticillium psalliotae.\n\nThe fungus is of East African origin, but is currently endemic to all producing regions. Coffee originates in high altitude regions of Ethiopia, Sudan, and Kenya, and the rust pathogen is believed to have originated in the same mountains. The earliest reports of the disease hail from the 1860s. It was reported first by a British explorer from regions of Kenya around Lake Victoria in 1861, from where it is believed to have spread to Asia and the Americas.\n\nRust was first reported in the major coffee growing regions of Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) in 1867. The causal fungus was first fully described by the English mycologist Michael Joseph Berkeley and his collaborator Christopher Edmund Broome after an analysis of specimens of a \"coffee leaf disease\" collected by George H.K. Thwaites in Ceylon. Berkeley and Broome named the fungus Hemileia vastatrix, \"Hemileia\" referring to the half smooth characteristic of the spores and \"vastatrix\" for the devastating nature of the disease.\n\nIt is unknown exactly how the rust reached Ceylon from Ethiopia. Over the years that followed, the disease was recorded in India in 1870, Sumatra in 1876, Java in 1878, and the Philippines in 1889. During 1913 it crossed the African continent from Kenya to the Congo, where it was found in 1918, before spreading to West Africa, the Ivory Coast (1954), Liberia (1955), Nigeria (1962–63) and Angola (1966).\n\nUredospores are disseminated across long distances mainly by wind and can end up thousands of miles from where they were produced. Over short distances, uredospores are disseminated by both wind and rain splash. Other agents, such as animals, mainly insects and contaminated equipment, occasionally have been shown to be involved with dissemination.\n\nPathogenesis\nHemileia vastatrix affects the plant by covering part of the leaf surface area or inducing defoliation, both resulting in a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis. Because berry yield is generally linked to the amount of foliage, a reduction in photosynthesis and more importantly, defoliation can affect yield. Continuous colonization of the pathogen depletes the plants resources for surviving until the plant no longer has enough energy to grow or survive.\n\nCoffee plants bred for resistance succeed because of cytological and biochemical resistance mechanisms. Such mechanisms involve transmitting signals to the infection site to stop cell function. The plants’ cell degradation response frequently occurs after the formation of the first haustorium and results in rapid hypersensitive cell death. Because Hemileia vastatrix is an obligate parasite, it can no longer survive when surrounded by dead cells. This can be recognized by the presence of browning cells in local regions on a leaf.\n\nEnvironment\nTemperature and moisture specifically play the largest role in infection rate of the coffee plant. Humidity is not enough to allow infection to occur. There must be a presence of water on the leaf for the urediospores to infect, although dry urediospores can survive up to six weeks without water. Dispersal happens primarily by wind, rain, or a combination of both. Transmission over large distances is likely the result of human intervention by spores clinging to clothes, tools, or equipment. Dispersal by insects is unlikely and therefore insignificant. Spore germination only happens when the temperature is , and peaks at ; furthermore. Appressorium formation is highest at  and has a linear decline in production until , when there is little to no production.  Although temperature and moisture are key factors for infection, dispersal, and colonization, plant resistance is also important in determining whether Hemileia vastatrix will survive.\n\nHistory\n\nThe disease coffee leaf rust (CLR) was first described and named by Berkley and Broom in the November 1869 edition of the Gardeners Chronicle.  They used specimens sent from Sri Lanka, where the disease was already causing enormous damage to productivity.  Many coffee estates in Sri Lanka were forced to collapse or convert their crops to alternatives not affected by CLR, such as tea. The planters nicknamed the disease \"Devastating Emily\" and it affected Asian coffee production for over twenty years.  By 1890, the coffee industry in Sri Lanka was nearly destroyed, although coffee estates still exist in some areas. Historians suggest that the devastated coffee production in Sri Lanka is one of the reasons why Britons have come to prefer tea, as Sri Lanka switched to tea production as a consequence of the disease.\n\nBy the 1920s CLR was widely found across much of Africa and Asia, as well as Indonesia and Fiji. It reached Brazil in 1970 and from there it rapidly spread at a rate enabling it to infect all coffee areas in the country by 1975. From Brazil, the disease spread to most coffee-growing areas in Central and South America by 1981, hitting Costa Rica and Colombia in 1983.\n\nAs of 1990, coffee rust has become endemic in all major coffee-producing countries.\n\n2012 coffee leaf rust epidemic\n\nIn 2012, there was a major increase in coffee rust across ten Latin American and Caribbean countries. The disease became an epidemic and the resulting crop losses led to a fall in supply, outstripping demand. Coffee prices rose as a result, although other factors such as growing demand for gourmet beans in China, Brazil, and India also contributed.\n\nUSAID estimates that between 2012 and 2014, CLR caused $1 billion in damage and affected over 2 million people in Latin America.\n\nThe reasons for the epidemic remain unclear but an emergency rust summit meeting in Guatemala in April 2013 compiled a long list of shortcomings. These included a lack of resources to control the rust, the dismissal of early warning signs, ineffective fungicide application techniques, lack of training, poor infrastructure and conflicting advice. In a keynote talk at the \"Let's Talk Roya\" meeting (El Salvador, November 4, 2013), Dr Peter Baker, a senior scientist at CAB International, raised several key points regarding the epidemic including the proportional lack of investment in research and development in such a high value industry and the lack of investment in new varieties in key coffee producing countries such as Colombia.\n\nTypical coffee cultivars maintained by farmers before the epidemic included Caturra, Bourbon, Mundo Novo, and Typica, all of which are susceptible to H. vastatrix. Also before the epidemic of 2012, 82% of farms were certified organic, which limits the agrochemicals farmers can use. However, there are a number of fungicides that can be used in certified organic systems, such as copper-based Bordeaux mix as well as commercial mixtures.\n\nHonduras\n\nDuring this period, Honduras experienced a significant epidemic of CLR. 80,000 hectares of coffee farms were infected and The Honduran National Institute of Coffee (IHCAFE) estimates that 30,000 farmers lost over half of their coffee production capacity and a third of those—10,000 farmers—suffered a complete loss of coffee production capacity. Roughly 84% of coffee producers in Honduras are smallholders and are therefore more vulnerable to loss of production than estate farmers.\n\nFurther\nCoffee crops in Guatemala have been ruined by coffee rust, and a state of emergency has been declared in February 2013.\n\nCLR has been a problem in Mexico.\n\nCLR disease is a big problem in coffee plantations in Peru, declared in sanitary emergency by government (Decreto Supremo N° 082-2013-PCM).\n\nIn late October 2020, USDA ARS detected rust on Maui. Immediately the Hawaii Department of Agriculture began inspections around the state, not just on Maui itself. They initially found plants they suspect to also be infected in Hilo on the big island, however these plants tested negative to CLR, though it was detected on plants in the Kailua-Kona region of the island. In January, 2021, additional infections have been found on the islands of Oahu and Lanai, and plant quarantines have gone into effect as of March 2021 for interisland transport of coffee plants or parts between the four islands that CLR has been found on.\n\nEconomic impact\nCoffee leaf rust (CLR) has direct and indirect economic impacts on coffee production.  Direct impacts include decreased quantity and quality of yield produced by the diseased plant and the cost of inputs meant specifically to control the disease. Indirect impacts include increased costs to combat and control the disease.  Methods of combating and controlling the disease include fungicide application and stumping diseased plants and replacing them with resistant breeds. Both methods include significant labor and material costs and in the case of stumping, include a years-long decline in production (coffee seedlings are not fully productive for three to five years after planting).\n\nDue to the complexity of accurately accounting for losses attributed to CLR, there are few records quantifying yield losses.  Estimates of yield loss vary by country and can range anywhere between 15 and 80%.  Worldwide loss is estimated at 15%.\n\nSome early data from Ceylon documenting the losses in the late 19th century indicate coffee production was reduced by 75%. As farmers shifted from coffee to other crops not affected by CLR, land used for growing coffee was reduced by 80%, from 68,787 to 14,170 ha.\n\nIn addition to the costs mentioned above, additional costs include research and development costs in producing resistant cultivars.  These costs are normally borne by the industry, local and national governments and international aid agencies.\n\nColombia's National Federation of Coffee Growers (Fedecafe) set up a research lab specifically designed to find ways to stop the disease, as the country is a leading exporter of the Coffea arabica bean that is particularly prone to the disease.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nHemileia vastatrix description at Plantvillage.com\nCoffee Research Institute: Coffee rust\nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln: Coffee rust\nThe University of Hawaii page on Hemileia vastatrix \nU.S.Dept.Agriculture page on Coffee Leaf Rust \n\nTeliomycotina\nCoffee diseases\nFungi of Africa\nFungi of Asia\nFungi of South America\nFungi of Colombia\nFungi described in 1869\nTaxa named by Miles Joseph Berkeley\nTaxa named by Christopher Edmund Broome"}

It is the seat of İskilip District. Its population is 17,612 (2022). The mayor is Ali Sülük.\n\nEtymology\nFormer names included Iskila (the name given to the area in Hittite times), Asklepios / Aesculapius (in ancient Greek), Blocium / Bloacium, İmad, Iskelib / İskelib (the ancient name returning into use in the Seljuk Turkish era), and Direklibel.\n\nGeography\nİskilip lies on a well-watered plain, several miles off the road between Çankırı and Amasya among wooded hills, at the foot of a limestone rock crowned by the ruins of an ancient fortress now filled with houses. Near the town are saline springs, from which salt has been extracted. The climate is dry. The highest point is  Mount Teke (1700m). The local economy depends on agriculture, especially grains and pulses, and forestry. Iskilip lies on the North Anatolian Fault.\n\nBy one calculation, the geographic center of all land area on Earth surface, is a mile or so to the northeast of Iskilip district, not far from Başmakçı, making it the centre of the world.\n\nHistory\nPeople have been attracted to the saline springs of İskilip since the earliest times, and the town stands on a route through the mountains to the Black Sea coast. Therefore, this is one of the longest-settled areas of Anatolia; copper was smelted here in ancient times, when the plain was settled by the Hittite and Hatti civilizations (from 3000 BC). Rock carvings on the hill of Yivlik are said to date to the Hittite period. The area which consists of İskilip and Tosya district of Kastamonu Province was known as Tarittara or Turmitta during the Hittite era.\n\nThe Hattic city was then possessed by Paphlagonian kings (from 900-700 BC), was mentioned in the Iliad, and was visited by Herodotus.  Then came the Galatians and the kings of Pontus, but these were soon displaced by a much stronger civilization. For the ancient Romans, who paid their soldiers in salt, the area had great importance. The Romans and, subsequently, the Byzantines settled here for a thousand years, making İskilip one of their key strongholds on the Kızılırmak. Byzantine rule of Anatolia ended in 1071 following the Byzantines' defeat by the Seljuk Turks at the battle of Malazgirt, and İskilip was soon settled (1074) by the Danishmend Turks, who brought Islam to the region. Centuries of fighting ensued between further Turkish clans and, from the 13th century, waves of Mongol and Tatar invaders.\n\nIn 1390, with the aid of Mongolian armies, the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I moved against the Turkish lords who, by now, were in control of this corner of Anatolia. After severe fighting in which an Ottoman prince was killed and the castles of Ankara, Kalecik, and others were besieged, Bayezid (the Thunderbolt) prevailed and the area was brought under Ottoman control. But the castle of İskilip had been seriously damaged, and most of the population dispersed during the fighting, never to return, perhaps wisely, as the area, in 1402, was the scene of even more terrible warfare between Bayezid's Ottomans and the Tatars of Timur.\nFollowing the Ottoman Interregnum, rule was restored by Bayezid's son Mehmed I, but İskilip's misfortune persisted, with destruction returning in 1509 in a large earthquake known as the little Armageddon.\n\nAt some stage, the area must have recovered, as, by the 17th century, Evliya Çelebi recorded a fortified town of 150 households, and, in 1849, French traveler Vital Cuinet recorded a city of 2,000 homes with a predominantly Muslim population of 10,563. There were 108 mosques, six dervish lodges, six koran schools, a civic building, five libraries, a market of 510 shops, two caravanserais, four Turkish baths, 18 fountains, a water garden, 18 tanneries, 63 flour mills, six bakeries, 10 coffee houses, a courthouse, a tax office, a post office, a telegraph office, and a census bureau. Gardens were used to grow buckthorn for making natural dye.\n\nThus, it is evident that the town has had a predominantly Turkish population since the 13th century, and the people of İskilip are said to speak Turkish with an accent that is the closest in modern Turkey to the language spoken by those first immigrants from the Central Asian heartland. In the early days of the Turkish Republic, linguists from the Turkish Language Institute conducted research in İskilip as part of the institute's program to bring authentic Turkish vocabulary into the language.\n\nFrom 1867 until 1922, İskilip was part of Angora vilayet. Unable to sustain the manufacturing or large-scaled trade that fuels a modern city, from the late 19th century, İskilip has declined and is now eclipsed by nearby Çorum, much to the resentment of the people of İskilip, who will buy cars with Ankara license plates rather than Çorum and will go to great lengths to avoid visiting the provincial capital. In 1930, the first bridge over the Kızılırmak was built, with wood, to connect İskilip with Çorum. \nThe first school in İskilip was opened in 1935, and the first high school in 1968.\n\nİskilip today\nModern İskilip is a small town that provides the area with schools and other amenities. The cuisine is typical of much of Anatolia, including a particularly renowned rice-based dolma, wheat soup keshkek, fruit syrup (pekmez), a dry egg-noodle erişte, spice-cured beef pastırma, roasted chick peas leblebi, a round loaf called Okkalık, and, of course, a local kebab, which is a meat-and-vegetable casserole.\n\nNotable people\n Ahmet Peker (born 1989), Freestyle wrestler\n Ebussuud Efendi, Ottoman Shaykh al-Islām\n İskilipli Âtıf Hodja - (d. 1926) Islamic scholar executed in the early days of the Turkish Republic for his longstanding opposition.\n İsmail Beşikçi (b. 1939) Sociologist, historian and writer, from a conservative family in İskilip has written on issues including Kurdish nationalism, the founding of the republic and the period of a one-party state.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMunicipality's official website\nA local newspaper\nA local interest website \n\nPopulated places in Çorum Province\nİskilip District\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey"}

Its area is 2,129 km2, and its population is 14,607 (2022). It is on the Çoruh River. The mayor is Ahmet Coşkun (MHP).\n\nHistory\n\nİspir is known from the 3rd millennium BC.  The ancient kingdom of Hayasa-Azzi (2nd millennium BC), which was the forerunner of Armenian statehood, was located in the upper reaches of the rivers Euphrates and Chorokh, and included Sper. The name Sper is thought by some to be derived from Saspers, or Sasperi, the name Sper with a Georgian prefix of place Sa-, which evolved into the term Iberian. The Saspers were mentioned by Xenophon;\n\nIn the 4th-3rd centuries BC Sper was organized into a province of the Iberian Kingdom as noted by Strabo.  Alexander the Great sent one of his generals Menon to conquer Sper, but Menon and his forces were defeated and killed.  The region was then a part of Upper Armenia (, Bardzr Hayk'), a province of Greater Armenia, since the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD. After this, Sper was an Armenian Bagratid domain in the 4th - 6th centuries, the territory of which also comprised the Bayburt plain until that was lost to the Byzantines (perhaps in 387).\n\nIn the 7th century it passed to the Arab Caliphate; in 885 Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia. Under the medieval Kingdom of Armenia, it was part of the province of Upper Armenia and was famous for its gold mines. In the 11th century it was conquered by the Seljuqs. Ispir was under the control of the Saltukids till 1124 when the Georgians took over power, governed by Zakare and Ivane Zakarids as a fief. It was recaptured by Mughith ad Din Tughrul, son of the Seljuk sultan Kilij Arslan II, sometime between 1201 and 1225. He built a mosque in the citadel which still survives. It was conquered in 1242 by the Mongols; was regained by Georgian Kingdom during the reign of George V the Brilliant (1314–1346), it remained part of the Kingdom before its disintegration, which then passed into the hands of Georgian Atabegs belonging to the House of Jaqeli; it was conquered in 1502 by Persia and was probably in 1515 taken by the Ottoman Empire from the Georgian ruler of Samtskhe. \n\nThe town was occupied in 1916 by the Russians during World War I and the Armenian genocide, then was recaptured by the Turks in 1918.\n\nHistoric sights in the town are the citadel, a mosque and a church in the citadel (probably 13th century), the originally 13th century Çarsi mosque's building being a recent structure. The Sultan Melik mosque and Madrasa built in the 13th century, the Madrasa of Kadizade Mehmet built in 1725/26, Kadizade was the Mufti of Erzurum from 1744 to 1759 and his father was the Qadi of Ispir. There is also a tomb with a graveyard containing some Ottoman tombstones.\n\nClimate\nThe climate is described as Humid Continental by the Köppen Climate System, abbreviated as Dfb.\n\nEconomy\n\nAs of 1920, coal was being produced in the area.\n\nComposition\nThere are 101 neighbourhoods in İspir District:\n\n Ahlatlı\n Akgüney\n Akpınar\n Akseki\n Aksu\n Aktaş\n Alacabük\n Araköy\n Ardıçlı\n Armutlu\n Aşağıfındıklı\n Aşağıözbağ\n Atürküten\n Avcıköy\n Bademli\n Bahçeli\n Başçeşme\n Başköy\n Başpınar\n Bostancı\n Bozan\n Çakmaklı\n Çamlıca\n Çamlıkaya\n Cankurtaran\n Çatakkaya\n Çayırbaşı\n Çayırözü\n Cibali\n Çiçekli\n Değirmendere\n Değirmenli\n Demirbilek\n Demirkaya\n Devedağı\n Duruköy\n Düzköy\n Elmalı\n Gaziler\n Geçitağzı\n Göçköy\n Gölyurt\n Gülhas\n Güllübağ\n Gündoğdu\n Güney\n Halilpaşa\n İkisu\n İncesu\n Irmakköy\n İyidere\n Karahan\n Karakale\n Karakamış\n Karakaya\n Karaseydi\n Karşıyaka\n Kavaklı\n Kaynakbaşı\n Kirazlı\n Kırık\n Kızılhasan\n Koçköy\n Köprüköy\n Kümetaş\n Leylekköy\n Madenköprübaşı\n Mescitli\n Meydanlı\n Moryayla\n Mülkköy\n Numanpaşa\n Ortaköy\n Ortaören\n Özlüce\n Öztoprak\n Petekli\n Pınarlı\n Sandıklı\n Şenköy\n Sırakonak\n Soğuksu\n Taşbaşı\n Taşlıca\n Tekpınar\n Tepecik\n Ulubel\n Ulutaş\n Üzümbağı\n Yağlı\n Yaylacık\n Yedigöl\n Yedigöze\n Yeşiltepe\n Yeşilyurt\n Yıldıztepe\n Yukarı\n Yukarıfındıklı\n Yukarıözbağ\n Yunusköy\n Zeyrek\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nThe website of the governor of İspir\nThe website of the tourism info\n\n \nPopulated places in Erzurum Province\nFormer provinces of Georgia (country)\nHistorical regions of Georgia (country)\nTao-Klarjeti\nDistricts of Erzurum Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey"}

{"id": "4104873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howsham%20Hall", "title": "Howsham Hall", "text": "Howsham Hall is a  grade I listed Jacobean stately home in Howsham, North Yorkshire, England.\n\nIt is built in two storeys of limestone ashlar to a U-shaped plan with a 7-bay frontage.\n\nHistory\nIn the early 16th century the Howsham estate belonged to nearby Kirkham Priory and following the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII was granted to Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland around 1540. His great-grandson sold it to Thomas Bamburgh. The present Hall was built in about 1610 on the site of a previous manor house, using stone from the priory, by Sir William Bamburgh, whose coat of arms, with those of his wife Mary Forthe, is above the main entrance. The cellar is Norman and the main part of the house is Jacobean. However the structure of the building has since been altered over the years. Sir William was High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1607–08.\n\nIn 1709, the house having passed by marriage to the Wentworth family, Sir John Wentworth added the east front.\n\nHaving passed again by marriage to the Cholmeley family of Whitby Abbey, the house was remodelled in about 1775 for Nathaniel Cholmeley, possibly by John Carr. There is a Georgian brick extension at the back of the house and some of the windows have been altered so they have larger panes in the Georgian style. The parkland was laid out by Capability Brown in the 1770s for the Cholmeley family. In the grounds are three Giant Sequoia trees arranged in a triangle. These were given to a limited number of country estates in the seventeenth century. Sequoias were unknown to European horticulture till the middle of the 19th century, post the California goldrush. \n \nThe estate passed to the Strickland family who sold the estate and its contents in 1948. In the 1950s, it was bought and converted into a boy's preparatory school.\n\nCurse of Kirkham\nWhen Kirkham Priory was demolished following the Protestant Reformation and the stones, timbers and other material were taken away by the Bamburghs and used in the construction of Howsham Hall, it was considered sacrilege at the time. It was said that true happiness would never come to the family or its successors and that a curse was placed on Howsham Hall and the people that owned it whereby \"All male heirs of the estate would perish\". The Bamburgh family died out because of the lack of male heirs, the Wentworth intermarried with the Bamburghs and they too became extinct. The next owners, the Cholmeleys, also became extinct and the Stricklands have only one female member of the family left. The last family to buy the house were the Knocks, and the curse continues, as Anthony Knock died after losing a battle with cancer in 2004.\n\nHowsham Hall School \n\nHowsham Hall was bought in 1956 by John Knock. It had been due to be demolished by the council, but in 1958 it opened as an independent boys' school. In 1993 the school introduced both girls and day pupils increasing school numbers to around 60.  The school was closed on 6 July 2007 at the end of the Summer Term due to dwindling pupil numbers.\n\nThe School\nThe subjects that the school taught were French, Maths, English, Latin, Poetry, History, Debating, Singing, R.E., Ancient History, Hand Writing, Art, Geography, I.T. and Science. Drama was also offered to pupils up until year 7. The school also offered music lessons. The total number of pupils was approximately 60 which meant that each year had around 10 pupils in each year group. This meant that class sizes were small as well. Howsham Hall was a Roman Catholic school and had a morning and evening service every weekday and mass on Sunday. In the Autumn and Spring terms boys played rugby, with the school fielding a 1st XV and an U11s team; while the girls had ballet, aerobics or needlework classes. Pupils also did cross country on Mondays and Thursdays culminating a 7 mile run at the end of the spring term called the \"championship\" an inter house competition. In the summer term boys did cricket with the school fielding 2 teams senior and junior and the girls did rounders. Horse riding was also offered on Tuesday afternoons and Swimming was done up until year 7 (Form 2) on Friday morning at Pickering. The school also offered occasional canoeing, shooting and sailing.\n\nAllegations of abuse \nIn 1998 allegations of abuse were brought against the school by a former pupil. The allegations included the beating of pupils with straps, pupils being made to stand in cold baths for hours, public humiliation of bed-wetters and censorship of letters home, however none of these allegations were proven and were subsequently dropped despite numerous testimonials from other former pupils.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nCountry houses in North Yorkshire\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire"}

{"id": "4104890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan%20Hampus%20Furuhjelm", "title": "Johan Hampus Furuhjelm", "text": "Johan Hampus Furuhjelm, (; 11 March 1821 – 21 September 1909) was a Finnish-Russian vice-admiral and explorer, commander of the Russian Baltic Fleet, Governor of the Russian Far East, Taganrog and Russian America.\n\nEarly years\nJohan Hampus Furuhjelm was born into a Swedish-speaking noble family of Furuhjelm in Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland on March 11, 1821. Johan Hampus was the son of Otto Wilhelm Furuhjelm (1794–1871) and Ulrica Johanna Fredrika Fock (1795–1856). Johan Hampus was schooled at home until 1836 when he joined the Navy (1st Finnish Sea Battalion 1:a finska sjöekipaget). Graduate of the Navy Corps, Furuhjelm served at Russian Baltic Fleet in 1838–1846. Promoted to midshipman 1839, lieutenant 1845. In 1843–1844, he participated in hydrographic works in the Gulf of Finland on board the schooner Meteor. In 1846–1847, he served at the Black Sea.\n\nIn Russian America\nIn 1850, Furuhjelm was detached to the new post in the Russian-American Company and sailed from Kronstadt to Novoarkhangel'sk (New Archangel, as the Russian community in Sitka was called) on board of the ship Nikolai I. He arrived to Novoarkhangel'sk on 23 April 1851, where he was appointed commander of Novoarkhangel'sk's seaport and sailed to Hawaii, California and China on behalf of the Russian-American Company. In 1853–1854, Furuhjelm was captain of the supply ship Count Menshikoff in the squadron of Admiral Yevfimy Putyatin. In 1854, he was appointed commander of the Ayan seaport and on 11 December 1858, Governor of Russian America. During a Christmas ball in Helsinki in 1858, Furuhjelm met the 22-year-old Anna von Schoultz. On 10 January they were engaged and on 2 February 1859 the wedding took place. In Novo Archangelsk, Furuhjelm was forced to acknowledge that one of the most acute needs was rebuilding the Indians' trust in the white man. During his period as governor of Alaska, he managed to put an end to hostilities with natives. Once, he used the trick of an eclipse of the moon. He threatened the Indians to take away the moon if they did not obey him. Furuhjelm's magic made a deep impression on the natives. They were also impressed because the governor dared to go out on inspection tours without an escort. He made the trips with just paddlers and an interpreter. Furuhjelm was successful in winning the Indians' respect and the camp was normalized.\n\nOne of the most important successes which Furuhjelm noted during his period as governor was that he was successful in abolishing the ice treaty with San Francisco. According to a contract which had been signed, Russian America had to deliver a certain amount of ice to San Francisco at a fixed price. The problem was that the product melted down on the way to the warmer climates. The ice contract became very awkward for the Russian colony. Furuhjelm arranged for a new contract to sell ice to San Francisco: 3,000 tons at $25.00 a ton.\n\nThe Furuhjelms had three children during their five years in Russian America. The oldest daughter Annie Furuhjelm later became one of the foremost figures within the international women's movement and a member of Finland's Parliament. On 17 March 1864 Johan Hampus Furuhjelm turned over his duties to prince Dmitri Petrovich Maksutov, who happened to be the last governor of Russian America. In the summer of 1864 it was time for the Furuhjelm family to make a move and leave Russian America.\n\nLater years\nIn 1865–1870, Furuhjelm served as military governor of Primorsky Krai. On 25 February 1871 he was appointed chief of Russian seaports in the Pacific, where he contributed a lot to development of Vladivostok and Primorsky Krai, opened the Amur Telegraph Company, several lighthouses and ship dockyards. In 1872 Furuhjelm was made Flag Officer of the Russian Baltic Fleet. In 1874, Ivan Furugelm was promoted to the rank of vice admiral and appointed governor of the city of Taganrog (1874–1876), where he opened the first naval school (founded by Ivan Shestakov) and the first public library (Chekhov Library) on 23 May 1876 (old style). Among library's most frequent visitors was Anton Chekhov. Anna Furuhjelm joined her husband in Taganrog for the winter 1874–1875 with the two youngest children. In 1878–1880 Hampus Furuhjelm served as commander of Revel's naval port. From 1880 until 1886, he was at the disposal of the commander of the port of Saint Petersburg. In 1889, on the occasion of his jubilee as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, he received a golden snuffbox, decorated with diamonds and the initials of Alexander III of Russia.\n\nFuruhjelm died on 21 September 1909 near Urjala, present-day Finland.\n\nPlaces named after Furuhjelm\nMount Furuhelm - A mountain  3,610 ft., 4.5 miles SW of Baranof, on East coast of Baranof Island, Alexander Archipelago. Named in 1935 by U.S. Forest Service for Ivan Vasilievitch Furuhelm, mining engineer and Governor of Russian America, 1859-1864;\nFurugelm Island - Island in Peter the Great Bay, Sea of Japan. Two islands discovered by Johan Hampus Furuhjelm in 1853. Named for him by the Russian Admiral Putyatin;\nFuruhelm Street - in Sitka, Alaska, located between Edgecumbe Drive and Georgeson Street, starting at Kimsham Street.\nFurugelm - A point and an island at Sakhalin, Sea of Japan. Named for Carl Harald Felix Furuhjelm, b. May 13, 1830 in Helsinki, Finland, d.

However the river only receives the name Elwy at the village of Llangernyw, where three rivers, Afon Cledwen, Afon Collen and Afon Gallen, meet to form the Elwy.\n\nIt flows eastwards through Llanfair Talhaiarn and a few miles downstream from this village it is joined by a tributary, the River Aled (Afon Aled) which has its source in Llyn Aled.\n\nAfter passing through Bont-newydd, the river turns northwards again and flows through St. Asaph (Llanelwy or \"the church enclosure on the Elwy\" in Welsh).

{"id": "4104908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy%20Keene", "title": "Katy Keene", "text": "Katy Keene is a character created by Bill Woggon that has appeared in several comic book series published by Archie Comics since 1945. She is a model/actress/singer marketed by the publisher as \"America's Queen of Pin-Ups and Fashions\". In the book From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women's Comics from Teens to Zines by Trina Robbins, Katy Keene is called a Bettie Page look-alike. \"... but the resemblance ended there.\n\nReaders were encouraged to submit original drawings of outfits and accessories for her and her friends to wear, as well as designs for automobiles, homes, interiors, rocket ships, trailers and boats. These designs were used in the comics with credit given to published submissions. Many issues featured paper dolls of Katy in various costumes.\n\nPublication history\nKaty Keene was introduced in Wilbur Comics #5 in the summer of 1945, and appeared in subsequent issues of Wilbur and various anthology comic series in the 1940s including Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica and Ginger, eventually receiving her own title in 1949. Katy Keene Comics ran for sixty-two issues, briefly cover titled Adventures of Katy Keene (#50–53) and simply Katy Keene (#54–62), until July 1961. It was accompanied by fifteen issues of Katy Keene Pin Up Parade (1955–1961) and thirteen issues (#1–2, 13–23) of Katy Keene Fashion Book Magazine (1955–1959), along with annuals and specials such as Katy Keene Spectacular (1956), Katy Keene Glamour (1957), Katy Keene Charm (1958), and Archie Giant Series Magazine—cover titled Archie Giant Series Presents Katy Keene Holiday Fun—#7 (1960) and #12 (1961).\n\n1980s revival\nIn Winter 1979–1980 Katy fan Craig Leavitt began publishing—with Archie Comics' permission—a fanzine which was initially titled Katy, then became Katy – The Newsletter for issues #2–7, before finally becoming Katy Keene Magazine, and which ran for 19 issues until 1985.  Having been a lifelong fan of the character, John S. Lucas's art was instrumental in the revival, as his work was featured in the magazine along with other artists' and fans' work.  Several \"Katy-Kons\" (conventions) were held in Santa Barbara, California, and then later in conjunction with the San Diego Comic-Con celebrating Woggon and Katy.\n\nArchie Comics decided to revive the character themselves in 1983, giving the character her own title by using reprint art of Woggon's as well as new art by Don Sherwood, Vince Colletta, Hy Eisman and Dan DeCarlo. It ran as Katy Keen Special from September 1983 to October 1984 (#1–6), and then simply as Katy Keene from December 1984 to January 1990 (#7–33). The first issue was released under the Red Circle Comics imprint, after which the covers carried an \"Archie Romance Series\" imprint.\n\nAfter seeing Lucas's art in the Katy Keene Fan Magazine and receiving letters from fans encouraging them to do so, Archie contacted Lucas, asking him to do the art for the revived Katy Keene Fan Club, which included pens, lapel buttons, membership cards, notepads, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Not long afterward, Archie brought Lucas on as regular Katy artist. During the '80s, '90s and 2000s,  Lucas carried on the Katy tradition with his comics, his annual Katy Keene Christmas Cards and Paper Dolls and paper doll books from Hobby House Press.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Katy once again went into retirement, except for a 1994 appearance in Archie Meets the Punisher.\n\n2005 reintroduction\nArchie re-reintroduced Katy, now a high school student and aspiring model, in its 2005 Free Comic Book Day issue. She then appeared in Archie & Friends Comics #101–110, the stories from which were compiled in the trade paperback, Katy Keene: Model Behavior (2008).\n\nNew Riverdale\nKaty Keene was reintroduced again in 2020 as part of the New Riverdale line of comics. She first appeared in Archie & Katy Keene, a four issue mini-series covering #710–713 within the Archie title. Keene, again a high school student, is an Instagram celebrity who moves to the city of Riverdale along with her teenaged younger sister,  Sissy Keene.\n\nAlso in 2020, Keene was featured in Archie Comics 80th Anniversary Presents #8, which reprints stories from the original series.\n\nSupporting cast\nKaty has a redheaded, bespectacled younger sister. In the original Woggon 1950s series, Katy's sister was a mischievous child around seven years old and known only as \"Sis, the Candy Kid\". In the 1980s, she was drawn as a tween or a young teen and received the name Melissa, but was still almost always called \"Sis\". In the short-lived 2000s series, her given name was Mackenzie. No explanation for the name change was given, although it may be due to the obscurity of the 1980s name. Regardless, her real name is almost never mentioned and to both readers and characters, she is always called \"Sis\". When Katy and her sister were re-introduced in 2020, her sister's name was revealed to actually be \"Sis Keene\", short for \"Sissy Keene\", instead of \"Sis\" just being a nickname like it previously was.\n\nOriginally, the 1950s Katy was 21 years old and Sis was about seven years old. In subsequent series, Katy is roughly the same age, but Sis was reimagined as being around 15 and has been so ever since. By this point, Katy had already been discovered in college. After going to work as an aspiring Broadway star, she became very successful in her modeling and acting career, so she became her sister's legal guardian.\n\nKaty has had many recurring boyfriends over the years, the most famous of which are the redheaded and muscular boxer K.O. Kelly and his rich blond rival Randy Van Ronson. They were not often seen regularly in the 1980s when Katy dated the Latino airline pilot and talented dancer Ramon Ramirez and the Arnold Schwarzenegger parody Arnold Horsenlegger. However, K.O. and Randy became her main love interests again in the 2000s.\n\nKaty's rival in her career and love life is the wealthy and snobby blonde Gloria Grandbilt and her best friend is the superstitious redhead Lucki Lorelei. Both Gloria and Lucki are also successful models, with the levelheaded brunette Katy rounding out the trio.\n\nReception\nThe character was ranked 57th in Comics Buyer's Guide's \"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\" list. In 2014, comparisons were made between pop star Katy Perry and Katy Keene, but Perry denied basing any of her image or costumes on the character and expressed surprise at the apparent similarities.\n\nTelevision adaptation\n\nIn August 2018, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Chief Creative Officer of Archie Comics and creator of The CW television series Riverdale revealed that a spin-off of the series was in the works at the network. He said that the potential spin-off would be \"very different from Riverdale\" and that it would be produced \"in [the 2018–19] development cycle.\" On January 23, 2019, The CW issued an official pilot order for the potential series, titled Katy Keene, that will reportedly follow \"the lives and loves of four iconic Archie Comics characters — including fashion legend-to-be Katy Keene — as they chase their twenty-something dreams in New York City. This musical dramedy chronicles the origins and struggles of four aspiring artists trying to make it on Broadway, on the runway and in the recording studio.\"\n\nFurther reading\n The Spectacular Sisterhood of Superwomen: Awesome Female Characters from Comic Book History by Hope Nicholson, Quirk Books (2017)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Archie Universe\n Katy Keene, Archie Series Number 2 \n Katy Keene at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

As such, it is connected to the title of a Cardinal priest, currently Antoine Kambanda.\n\nBasilica \nThe basilica was constructed in the fourth century and is recorded as the Titulus Crescentianae, thus relating the church to a certain Crescentia (possibly a Roman woman who founded the church.) According to tradition, the church was established by Pope Anastasius I (399–401).\n\nThe church is dedicated to Pope Sixtus II and houses his relics (transferred there from the Catacomb of Callixtus in the sixth century.)\n\nSan Sisto was rebuilt in the early 13th century by Pope Innocent III. The current church is the result of the restorations of Pope Benedict XIII in the 18th century, which left only the bell tower and the apse from the medieval church.\n\nA 13th-century fresco cycle depicting scenes from the New Testament and the Apocrypha has been preserved.\n\nPope Honorius III entrusted the reform of the monastery at San Sisto Vecchio to Dominic in the 1220s, intending it as part of the reformation of women's religious life in Rome. In 1219 Honorius then invited Dominic and his companions to take up permanent residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did in the early 1220. After that they founded a convent and studium on June 5, 1222, thus forming the original studium of the Dominican Order in Rome, out of which the 16th-century College of Saint Thomas at Santa Maria sopra Minerva and the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) would grow.\n\nDominican nuns still occupy the monastery at San Sisto Vecchio.\n\nCardinal protectors \nThe following persons are known to have been Cardinal priests of S.

In January 2006, he proposed legislation to ban sorcery, telling parliament, \"It's becoming more popular for people in Bahrain to turn to fortune tellers and sorcerers to find out what their future holds or to act as mediums to harm others or make people fall in love with them. There are many homes around the country that are known to be practicing black magic and if you drive past them a large number of cars from around the GCC would be found parked outside.\" This created consternation among the Kingdom's magicians and fortune tellers, with soothsayer Dina, responding, \"I can understand the MPs' feelings because there are fraudsters out there, but it's not fair for those who truly have the gift of seeing the future and dealing with the supernatural.\"\n\nIn February 2006, Mattar proposed the introduction of Sharia Law, saying that the removal of thieves' hands would address rising crime, particularly burglaries. Explaining the move, he said, \"Thieves should feel the agony of their victims and this would be a permanent lesson to them.\" Continuing his campaign to introduce amputations, in April 2006 he compared Bahrain's jails to \"five star hotels\" and said that a recent prison inspection by the Bahrain Human Rights Society is \"something I really feel awkward about, considering that the criminals did not treat others fairly when they stole from them\".\n\nMattar's proposals for Sharia Law led to a clash with Bahrain's government when he tried to amend Article 342 of the Penal Code so that those who kill someone in an accident would have to pay blood money to the victim's family or lose their own lives. Determining the blood money would be at the discretion of the victim's family. The move was opposed by a majority of Bahrain's MPs.\n\nReferences\n\nBahraini Islamists\nSunni Islamists\nMembers of the Council of Representatives (Bahrain)\nLiving people\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nAl Asalah politicians"}

{"id": "4104963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy%20Woolfolk", "title": "Dorothy Woolfolk", "text": "Dorothy Woolfolk née Dorothy Roubicek (October 1, 1913 – November 27, 2000) was one of the first women in the American comic-book industry. As an editor at DC Comics, one of the two largest companies in the field, during the 1940s period historians and fans call the Golden Age of Comic Books, she is credited with helping to create the fictional metal Kryptonite in the Superman mythos.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and education \nBorn  Dorothy Roubicek, Woolfolk was a New York City high school graduate who never attended college but nonetheless won prizes on a 1950s television game show.\n\nEditor \nShe served from 1942 to 1944 as an editor at All-American Publications, one of the three companies that would merge to form the present-day DC, then spent the next two years at Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor to Marvel Comics, and in 1948 was an editor at EC Comics.\n\nWoolfolk said in 1993 that she had found Superman's invulnerability dull, and that DC's flagship hero might be more interesting with an Achilles' heel such as adverse reactions to a fragment of his home planet. This gave rise to the famous fictional metal kryptonite, which made its first appearance in the comics in the story \"Superman Returns To Krypton!\", credited to writer Bill Finger, in Superman #61 (Dec. 1949).\n\nAfter raising children Donald and Donna, the latter of whom would become an author, Woolfolk briefly returned to comics in the 1970s, editing Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, Young Romance, and other DC superhero and romance titles from 1971 to 1974. Comics artist Alan Kupperberg, who worked with her at DC Comics in the 1970s, said in 2001,\n\nHer assistant editor at DC, Ethan Mordden, would go on to become a notable LBGT author.\n\nWriter \nShe also occasionally scripted comics, including an unknown number of Wonder Woman stories in the 1940s — making Woolfolk the first female writer of that series, and, with Ruth Atkinson and Ruth Roche, among comic books' first female writers. Woolfolk also wrote for the science fiction magazine Orbit during the 1950s, and in the 1970s and early 1980s was the author of the 10-book Scholastic Press young-adult novel series about teen detective Donna Rockford.\n\nPersonal life \nHer second husband was 1930s comic-strip cartoonist and 1940s comic-book writer Walter Galli. She met her third husband, novelist William Woolfolk, during her stint at DC, when she rejected a script he had submitted for a Superman comic book.\n\nWoolfolk's daughter, Donna Woolfolk Cross, is also an author; her work includes the historical novel Pope Joan (Ballantine, 1996).\n\nWoolfolk, who lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan while working in comics and as an author, moved to Norfolk, Virginia, in 1996. Two years later, she began to reside at the St. Francis Nursing Center in Newport News, Virginia, and died at Mary Immaculate Hospital in that city on November 27, 2000.\n\nAwards \nWoolfolk was nominated every year from 2001 to 2004 for induction into the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2018, Woolfolk won the 2018 Bill Finger Award from San Diego Comic-Con International.\n\nSee also\nWomen in comics\n\nBooks\n\nDonna Rockford Mystery series \nThe Girl Cried Murder (original title: \"Murder, My Dear!\"; Scholastic, 1974) 1983 reissue: \nMurder in Washington and the Body on the Beach — Donna Rockford Double Mystery Series (Scholastic, 1982) \nMother Where Are You?

{"id": "4104968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaburun", "title": "Karaburun", "text": "Karaburun (, Achirlí) is a municipality and district of İzmir Province, Turkey. Its area is 421 km2, and its population is 12,200 (2022). The district area roughly corresponds to the peninsula of the same name (Karaburun Peninsula) which spears north of the tourism resorts of neighboring Çeşme and its dependencies and west of the city of İzmir. In fact, the district area is one of the westernmost points of Anatolia. Karaburun town is situated close to the northern tip of the peninsula and checks the entry of the Gulf of İzmir with the town of Foça, another important tourism resort, across the waters. The district's administrative zone is bordered by the districts of Çeşme and Urla in its south and faces the Greek island of Chios to its west.\n\nKaraburun region is comparatively much less visited than Çeşme located in its south, its rate of urbanization at 20 per cent is the lowest across İzmir Province, although it provides an anticlimax to its southern neighbor and the associated attractions especially for those who want to escape the trails of mass tourism. The coasts of the peninsula have beautiful bays and pebble or sand beaches as yet often undiscovered by outsiders, although there is one German vacation village slightly to the north of the district center. Taken as a whole, in contrast with Çeşme, agriculture, fishing and livestock breeding, instead of tourism, remain the principal activities on which the district's economy is based. Karaburun's flora and fauna present particularities distinguishing it from the Anatolian mainland. Karaburun's name echoes in Turkey a very high variety of flower breeds present across its area, and especially narcissus and hyacinth.\n\nMain features\nThe distance between Karaburun and İzmir center by way of land is 100 km (approximately 60 miles) and there are regular bus services and a three-lane modern highway until the toll near Çeşme. The rest of the road is narrow and curvy in some places and it may take up to two hours to reach Karaburun from İzmir. The country road is traced northwards along the eastern coast of the peninsula to reach Mordoğan first, which is, aside from Karaburun, the district's only other depending township with own municipality. After Karaburun, the same road continues towards the tip of the peninsula from where it heads west to reach the village of Küçükbahçe.\n\nHistory\nThe oldest name known for the region was Mimas, in reference to the son of Gaia who was one of the Giants slain by Hephaistos during the war between Gods and Giants in Greek mythology. Homer mentions the \"windy Mimas\" mountain (present-day Bozdağ) in his Odyssey. The Mimas mountain is also associated with Iris, Leto and Narcissus. In Ionian through to Byzantine times, the region also carried the names Stelar or Stylarius, Caleberno by the Genoese and Ahırlı during the Ottoman era. There are different possibilities for the name Karaburun. One that is mentioned in the municipality web site is that it would be a modified form of Caleberno. Another possibility may have to do with the very translation of the Turkish name, which means \"black cape\", a fitting description especially for sailors who approach Karaburun Peninsula from open sea.\n\nThe region is rich in history although its only sizeable urban center from ancient Greek, Byzantine through to Ottoman times was in Erythrai. Today the village of Ildırı stands in the ancient town's location and the village depends Çeşme. Traces of smaller settlements can also be traced back to the Bronze Age.\n\nKaraburun is the most recently constituted district of İzmir, although the town of Karaburun was made into a municipality already in 1902. From 1867 until 1922, Karaburun was part of Aidin Vilayet.\n\nAccording to the 1914 Ottoman population statistics, the district of Karaburun had a total population of 18,772, consisting of 9,934 Greeks and 8,838 Muslims.\n\nEconomy\nAgriculture, fishing and livestock breeding remain the principal activities on which Karaburun's economy is based. The average yearly income level per inhabitant for the district was calculated at 3,673 US Dollars in 2007. Karaburun's trade relations with the outside world abroad remain modest, with total exports recorded as 26,319 US Dollars realized in 2007, mostly flowers, with also some exports of olive and olive oil and artichokes. Underground reserves include marble quarries, deposits of basalt, slate for constructions and clay for ceramics. Mercury was also mined in the past. The district's total number of companies stood at 525 the same year. There was only one bank operating through one branch in Karaburun in 2007.\n\nThe total number of residences in Karaburun district was counted as 8,912, an important part constituted by secondary residences owned by seasonal inhabitants. The total accommodation capacity of the district is 982 beds, in which the depending municipality of Mordoğan has a sizable share. The level of literacy in Karaburun nears hundred per cent, and the district is advantaged by the rather comfortable number of students,  12 in 2007, per teacher. There was one doctor for 1,447 patients in Karaburun in 2007.\n\nOther information\nNearer to Karaburun is the abandoned village of Sazak whose inhabitants were subject to the 1923 Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in the frame of the Treaty of Lausanne. Sazak today is a ghost town rarely visited by tourists from Karaburun.\n\nThe whole district is very quiet during winter when the population of Karaburun center falls back to the usual 2,500, with the owners of summer houses gone. Nevertheless, its spectacular gorges and heights makes the peninsula a favorite destination among trekkers in all seasons.\n\nThere is talk since years on starting ferry services from İzmir to these two centers of the peninsula, which would be quite practical by allowing visitors to avoid the difficult end-portion of the land route, but the project meets the opposition of the dolmuş lobby.\n\nComposition\nThere are 16 neighbourhoods in Karaburun District:\n\n Ambarseki\n Bozköy\n Eğlenhoca\n Hasseki\n İnecik\n İskele\n Kösedere\n Küçükbahçe\n Merkez\n Mordoğan\n Parlak\n Saip\n Salman\n Sarpıncık\n Tepeboz\n Yaylaköy\n\nSee also\n Karaburun Peninsula\n September 2006 Karaburun, Turkey migrant boat disaster\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nSources\n\n \n \n\n \nPopulated coastal places in Turkey\nPopulated places in İzmir Province\nTourist attractions in İzmir Province\nFishing communities in Turkey\nAncient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey\nDistricts of İzmir Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey"}

Its area is 1,158 km2, and its population is 84,907 (2022). It is located just west of the Simav River near its confluence with the Adirnaz River. The district of Karacabey borders the districts of Mudanya and Nilüfer from east, Mustafakemalpaşa and Susurluk from south, Manyas from southwest and Bandırma from west. It is sited on the ancient town of Miletopolis.\n\nKaracabey is an industrial area as well as an agricultural one. It is known as the plantation area of a special variety of onions. There are many famous food factories around Karacabey such as Nestle and many varieties of vegetables and fruits are planted in Karacabey. There is a nearby lake called Uluabat. The Marmara Sea is 32 km to the north.\n\nHistory\nThe town is named after a local Turkish chieftain during the Ottoman era named Karaca Bey. The former name of the town was Mihalich (), after which a cheese was named, while its ancient name was Miletopolis (Greek: Μιλητόπολις). Miletopolis was apparently the chief settlement of a group of people called the Milatæ, whose name was hellenized to suggest a Milesian colony. Its people colonized Gargara. \n\nMiletopolis was a suffragan of Cyzicus until the 12th or 13th century. Around the end of the twelfth century, it was united with Lopadium as an archbishopric. There are two historical mosques in Karacabey, one being from the 14th century.\n\nFrom 1867 until 1922, Mihaliç was part of Hüdavendigâr vilayet.\n\nComposition\nThere are 85 neighbourhoods in Karacabey District:\n\n Abdullahpaşa\n Akçakoyun\n Akçasusurluk\n Akhisar\n Arız\n Bakırköy\n Ballıkaya\n Bayramdere\n Beylik\n Boğazköy\n Cambaz\n Çamlıca\n Canbalı\n Çarıkköy\n Çavuşköy\n Çeşnigir\n Dağesemen\n Dağkadı\n Danişment\n Doğla\n Drama\n Ekinli\n Ekmekçi\n Emirsultan\n Esentepe\n Eskikaraağaç\n Eskisarıbey\n Fevzipaşa\n Garipçe\n Gazi\n Gölecik\n Gölkıyı\n Gönü\n Güngörmez\n Hamidiye\n Harmanlı\n Hayırlar\n Hotanlı\n Hüdavendigar\n Hürriyet\n İkizce\n İnkaya\n İsmetpaşa\n Karacaahmet\n Karakoca\n Karasu\n Kedikaya\n Keşlik\n Kıranlar\n Küçükkaraağaç\n Kulakpınar\n Kurşunlu\n Mamuriyet\n Mecidiye\n Muratlı\n Nasrettin\n Okçular\n Örencik\n Orhaniye\n Ortasarıbey\n Ova Hamidiye\n Ovaesemen\n Runguşpaşa\n Saadet\n Şahinköy\n Şahmelek\n Sazlıca\n Selimiye\n Seyran\n Sırabademler\n Subaşı\n Sultaniye\n Tabaklar\n Taşlık\n Taşpınar\n Tavşanlı\n Tophisar\n Uluabat\n Yarış\n Yenice\n Yenikaraağaç\n Yenimahalle\n Yenisarıbey\n Yeşildere\n Yolağzı\n\nSee also\n Ulubatlı Hasan\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Karacabey Governorship\n Karacabey Municipality\n\n \nPopulated places in Bursa Province\nMilesian colonies\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nDistricts of Bursa Province"}
{"id": "4104973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer%20Aspect", "title": "Killer Aspect", "text": "Killer Aspect is a Finnish rock band from Helsinki. Its members are Max Paananen (vocals), Jaakko Teittinen (guitar), Jukka Savela (guitar), Jarkko Toivanen (bass), and Teijo Jämsä (drums). Their first single, \"TV\", made it to number one in the YleX radio charts.\n\nCareer\nKiller Aspect was founded in 2004 as Cabincrew by two former members of the band Killer - Timo Huhtala and Teijo Jämsä - and Samuli Relander, who used to play guitar for the bands The Winyls and Personal Aspect.\n\nSince the name Cabincrew was already used by a dance act, the three changed their name to Killer Aspect, inspired by their former bands.\nThey began meeting at Timo's place and after listening to some demo tapes, they decided to get serious about their musical effort. The band was soon rounded out by Max Paanen, a friend of Timo's, and Jukka Backlund, Killer's on-tour keyboard player.\n\nThe band started practising at Kaapelitehdas (the Cable Factory) and wrote their first song, \"First Dance\". This was followed by a few more, after which the band booked Finnvox Studios and recorded their first six tracks. After that, they started rehearsing for their first shows and went on to play Provinssirock, Tavastia Club (opening for Poets of the Fall), and the On the Rocks club in Helsinki.\n\nIn 2006, Jukka Backlund left the band to become a full-time member of Sunrise Avenue, the band whose debut album he had produced and whom he had initially joined as a live keyboard player.\n\nIn 2007, Valeri Drobych - the youngest member of the band - completed Killer Aspect. He had known Teijo and Timo through a video shoot for Natalia Podolskaya's \"Nobody Hurt No One\", a song written by Valeri's father as a Russian contribution to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2005. Valeri and Teijo also played with Natalia's live setup in Kyiv.\n\nKiller Aspect's first single, \"TV\", began getting radio airplay in December 2007 and immediately made it to number one in the YleX radio charts. Their follow-up single \"Bloodshot\" was also successful and made it to number 5 in the year's hitlist. The band's debut album, How Does It Work, was released in April 2008.\n\nIn late 2008, Timo Huhtala left the band and Jaakko Pulkki took over on bass.\n\nAfter a record label change and a new record deal, plus a new lineup, the band released their second album, Brand New Start, on 5 April 2013.\n\nIn 2015, Killer Aspect began to write new songs with a fresh lineup (Jaakko Teittinen on guitar and Jarkko Toivanen on bass), and they have since released several singles from their upcoming album.\n\nIn May 2021, they released a new single, called \"Troubles\" and another one in August 2021, \"Back to Basics\".\n\nBand members\n\nCurrent\n Max Paananen – vocals\n Jaakko Teittinen – guitar\n Jukka Savela – guitar\n Jarkko Toivanen – bass\n Teijo Jämsä – drums\n\nFormer\n Samuli Relander – guitar\n Valeri Drobych – guitar\n Lauri Yrjölä – guitar\n Tapio Backlund – bass\n Jaakko Pulkki – bass\n Esa Mäkynen – bass\n Timo Huhtala – bass\n Jukka Backlund – keyboards\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n How Does It Work (2008)\n Brand New Start (2013)\n\nSingles\n \"TV\" (2007)\n \"Bloodshot\" (2008)\n \"Writings on the Wall\" (2012)\n \"Box Car Champion\" (2013)\n \"The High Road\" (2019)\n \"Black Summer\" (2019)\n \"Ten Steps\" (2019)\n \"The Good, the Bad and the Worst\" (2019)\n \"Troubles\" (2021)\n \"Back to Basics (2021)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n MySpace papge\n Killer Aspect on LiveJournal\n\nFinnish musical groups\nFinnish rock music groups\nMusical groups from Helsinki\nMusical groups established in 2004"}

The character first appeared in Batman and the Outsiders #1 (August 1983).\n\nFictional character biography\nBaron Bedlam is really Baron Frederick DeLamb (\"Bedlam\" is an anagram of his last name). DeLamb's father, formerly a minor government official in the kingdom of Markovia, was installed as a puppet ruler by the Nazis during World War II. It was during this time that Bedlam made advances to a young woman. She became distressed over this and smashed a bottle into his face. Bedlam gained a prominent scar from that incident, and the woman was executed. At the end of the war, American forces helped the Markov family reclaim the throne. Even though Frederick managed to flee the country, his father was hanged by the mob.\n\nYears later, Frederick DeLamb, taking the name Baron Bedlam, gains the support of the Soviet army and the mysterious political manipulator Bad Samaritan. Bedlam murders King Viktor and seizes the throne. Soviet and Markovian forces battle, leading to deaths on both sides.\n\nThe crown prince, Brion Markov, with the aid of the scientist Dr. Jace, gains superpowers for the express purpose of stopping this invasion. With the aid of other superheroes, a grouping under Batman's leadership that would soon call themselves the Outsiders, they infiltrate the country. But having heard of Dr. Jace's work in metahuman research, Bedlam underwent a similar process to Prince Markov and gained similar earth-manipulating abilities. In order to aid in the invasion of Markovia and depose King Gregor to take back the country. In the final confrontation between Bedlam's forces and Markovia's outmatched army, the Outsiders intervene, turning the tide of the battle. Geo-Force apparently kills Bedlam by dropping him into a raging mob. Bedlam survives this, however, and has returned many times to face the team.\n\nSoon after, the Outsiders confront another aspect of Bedlam's forces, the super-powered Masters of Disaster. The two groups engage in a prolonged battle. In the meantime, the Bad Samaritan also discovers Bedlam's plan to clone Adolf Hitler, when it's revealed that he was indeed killed but cloned back to life in a similar process.  Bedlam was not pleased at this and attacks his ally. The clone project ultimately ends in failure. The new Hitler ends up being greatly distressed at what his 'father' has done and has no wish to continue the madness. The Hitler clone later commits suicide, his body being found by the Outsiders. \n\nAt one point, in the Outsiders 1987 special, DeLamb's Baron Bedlam identity is usurped by the Psycho Pirate.\n\nPowers and abilities\nBaron Bedlam is a superior fighter, a ruthless tactician and he possesses unlimited financial resources. He once underwent the same Geo-Force enhancement process which bestowed Brion Markov his unique metahuman abilities. Though Bedlam's were further along than the Prince's, given his ability to manipulate the earth long before Brion could. But because Fredrick was not of the royal line in Markovian principality, Bedlam's faulty powers shorted out in heated battle with the revived hero, leaving him powerless once more.\n\nOther versions\nThe name Baron Bedlam has recently been taken by another DC supervillain, formerly known as Doctor Bedlam.\n\nIn other media\nBaron Frederick DeLamb / Baron Bedlam appears in Young Justice: Outsiders, voiced by Nolan North. This version is the brother of Markovia's queen and biological uncle of Princes Gregor and Brion Markov who runs a secret metahuman trafficking syndicate in Markovia called Bedlam. Additionally, he has undergone metahuman experimentation, which gave him a stone-like body capable of withstanding lava and Superboy's punches with no visible damage. DeLamb orchestrates a coup by hiring a Quraci speedster to murder the king and queen, and then attempts to frame Brion for his crimes. However, Gregor easily sees through his uncle's lies and has him arrested after Superboy defeats DeLamb. DeLamb later escapes captivity and attempts to regain the throne, but is killed by Brion, who was secretly manipulated by Zviad Baazovi into doing so.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nCosmic Teams: Baron Bedlam\n\nCharacters created by Mike W.

It was initially released in 1990 through French independent label Intellectual Convulsion and reissued in 1992 by Century Media.\n\nBackground and recording\nEyehategod was formed in 1988 and recorded two demos, Garden Dwarf Woman Driver and Lack of Almost Everything, released in the years 1989 and 1990, respectively. Originally, the band did not take themselves seriously, and only formed to rebel against what they call \"the norm of underground music at the time\". The album was recorded and produced by the band themselves at Festival Studios in Kenner, Louisiana for about $1,000.\n\nRelease\n\nThe album was originally released by French label Intellectual Convulsion, but only around 1,500–2,000 CD and vinyl copies were pressed before the label had to shut down due to financial difficulties. The group would later be signed onto Century Media, who re-released the album with new artwork on December 1, 1992. In 2004, Emetic Records repressed the album on vinyl, 1,000 copies total: 300 green marbled, 700 black. In 2006, as a part of Century Media's 20th anniversary, the album was reissued with the original cover art and the entirety of the band's 1990 demo Lack of Almost Everything as bonus tracks. These same exact demo recordings also appeared on the band's 2001 live album 10 Years of Abuse (and Still Broke). The year 2008 saw Emetic Records again reissuing the album on vinyl, this time as a double disc LP set with the first disc being composed of the album itself and the second disc being made up of the same four bonus Lack of Almost Everything demos from the 2006 CD reissue. This 2008 pressing was limited to 500 black copies. This edition would later be repressed in 2011, again in quantities of 500 black copies\n\nIn 2015, the album, along with Take as Needed for Pain, was repressed on vinyl through Century Media. This 2015 pressing was made available on black, white (limited to 100 copies) and gold (limited to 500 copies) colored vinyl. Also released on the same day was a four-disc CD boxset containing the group's first four albums (including In the Name of Suffering).\n\nReception\n\nSince its initial release, In the Name of Suffering has received praise for its rough style, and is seen as one of the first, as well as one of the most important, sludge metal albums of the 1990s. Heavy metal website Hellbound.ca mentioned how In the Name of Suffering, along with its follow-up Take as Needed for Pain, created the framework for \"one of the most interesting, yet disturbing, bands around\". In William York's review of the album for AllMusic, he states \"Later Eyehategod albums have more memorable songs, but In the Name of Suffering arguably captures the band's compelling ugliness in its most raw state.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\nRelease history\n\nCredits\n Mike IX Williams — vocals\n Mark Schultz — lead guitar\n Jimmy Bower — rhythm guitar\n Steve Dale — bass\n Joe LaCaze — drums\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nEyehategod albums\n1990 debut albums"}

There is a wrestling tournament in late-April to early-May at Salbaş and a countryside festival in the last week of August at Kızıldağ.\n\nHistory\nIn Greek and Roman times there was a town here named Midelle. Throughout history, the town was controlled by several kingdoms, such as the Seljuk Turks and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Following the arrival of the Turks in the area the name was changed to Çeceli and inhabited by the Yüreğir and Menemencioğulları and  Ramazanoğulları tribes.\n\nBetween 1481 and 1496 the town was controlled by the Mamluk Sultanate and once it was defeated by the Ottoman sultan Selim I, he left the control of the town to the Ramazanoğulları dynasty as a vassal state. The current name Karaisalı was later given in memory of a Ramazanoğulları lord. Right before his death in 1520 however, Selim I decided to formally annex the town and the surrounding region into the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe town was not occupied by the Allies during the Turkish War of Independence in the early 1920s and became a centre of Turkish resistance against the Allies for the Çukurova area.\n\nComposition\nThere are 62 neighbourhoods in Karaisalı District:\n\n Akçalı\n Aktaş\n Altınova\n Aşağıbelemedik\n Aşağıyörükler\n Ayakkıf\n Barakdağı\n Başkıf\n Bekirli\n Beydemir\n Bolacalı\n Boztahta\n Bucak\n Çakallı\n Çatalan\n Çeceli\n Çevlik\n Çocuklar\n Çorlu\n Çukur\n Demirçit\n Döşekevi\n Durak\n Eğlence\n Emelcik\n Etekli\n Fettahlı\n Filikli\n Gildirli\n Gökhasanlı\n Gülüşlü\n Güvenç\n Hacılı\n Hacımusalı\n Kaledağı\n Kapıkaya\n Karahasanlı\n Karakılıç\n Karakuyu\n Karapınar\n Kıralan\n Kırıklı\n Kocaveliler\n Körüklü\n Kuşcusofulu\n Kuyucu\n Kuzgun\n Maraşlı\n Murtçukuru\n Nergizlik\n Nuhlu\n Ömerli\n Sadıkali\n Sarımehmetli\n Saypınar\n Selampınar\n Tatık\n Topaktaş\n Topkaralı\n Torunsolaklı\n Tümenli\n Yazıbaşı\n\nPlaces of interest\nThe Roman built Milvan Castle in the village of Karakılıç.\nThe silk road caravanserai Kesiri Han in the village of Altınova.\nAnother Roman castle Keçi Kalesi 40 km north-east of Karaisalı in the village of Etekli. has commanding views from its hill-top position.\nThe wooded hillside picnic areas of Yerköprü and Kızıldağ in particular Kapıkaya Canyon.\nThe attractive remote village of Kalayçılar. 7 km from the village of Hacılı on a dirt road.\nTurkey's highest bridge, the  long and  high German built railway viaduct Varda Bridge in the village of Hacıkırı (Kıralan).\nThe Fish restaurant in Demirçit or otherwise known as Bolagat.\n\nNotable people\nLong-term mayor of Adana, Aytaç Durak is from Karaisalı and during his term the district was included in the Metropolitan Municipality of Adana.\n\nReferences\n\n \nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nDistricts of Adana Province\nPopulated places in Adana Province"}

{"id": "4105015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapi%20Agha", "title": "Kapi Agha", "text": "The Kapi Agha (, \"Agha of the Gate\"), formally called the Agha of the Gate of Felicity (Bâbüssaâde ağası), was the head of the eunuch servants of the Ottoman Seraglio until the late 16th century, when this post was taken over by the Kizlar Agha. In juxtaposition with the latter office, also known as the Chief Black Eunuch as its holders were drawn from Black African slaves, the Kapi Agha is also known as the Chief White Eunuch.\n\nHistory and functions \nAs his title implies, the Kapi Agha controlled the Gate of Felicity that separated the Outer Court (Birûn, where state affairs were conducted), from the Inner Court (Enderûn) and the Sultan's private apartments in the Topkapı Palace. The Agha occupied an office to the right of the gate and had the duty of controlling entrance to the Inner Court and of transmitting the Sultan's orders to his officials, rendering him, in the words of the Ottomanist Halil İnalcık, \"the sole mediator between the Sultan and the world outside the Palace\". The duties of the Kapi Agha and his white eunuchs also included running the Palace School for the pages of the palace, whose graduates then went on to become the administrative élite of the Ottoman Empire. The \"Mosque of the Aghas\" (Ağalar Camii) in the Topkapi Palace was built for use by the Kapi Agha and his eunuchs.\n\nThe office of the Kapi Agha was an influential post, the holder became a close adviser to the Sultan and could play a decisive role in the imperial succession. Holders bore the rank of vizier and came in precedence only after the grand vizier and the shaykh al-Islām. In his heyday in the 15th and 16th centuries, the Kapi Agha rivaled the Grand Vizier in importance. Nevertheless, and in contrast to his analogues in other Islamic states, usually denoted by variants of the title hajib, the holders of the office never expanded their power to the extent that they could rival that of the Sultan. Unlike their counterparts, the Kapi Aghas controlled neither the administrative apparatus, which remained firmly in the hands of the Grand Vizier, nor the palace troops, which came under the command of another official, the Agha of the Janissaries, who notably also received about five times the Kapi Agha's daily salary of 100 akçes. Nevertheless, many Kapi Aghas went on to assume major provincial governorships (often distinguished by the epithet hadım, \"eunuch\", in their subsequent careers), and several are considered by modern historians among the greatest Ottoman statesmen of the period.\n\nThe post reached its height in the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–1566), when its holders became the stewards of the charitable foundations and endowments (waqfs) designated for the upkeep of the two holy cities (Haramayn) of Islam, Mecca and Medina, and of over seventy large mosques. During this time, the holders of the office engaged in open rivalry with the Grand Viziers for control over state affairs. Soon after, however, through the influence of the women of the Ottoman Imperial Harem, the Kapi Agha was eclipsed by the Kizlar Agha, who supervised the harem. The Kizlar Agha became independent of the Kapi Agha in 1587, assumed the control of the Haramayn and quickly rose to become the senior palace official. The final blow to the authority of the office came in 1704, when its remaining powers were transferred to the Silahdar Agha. The position of the Kapi Agha survived, but thereafter was devoid of any significance.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n \n\nOttoman court\nOttoman culture\nSlaves from the Ottoman Empire\nEunuchs from the Ottoman Empire\nOttoman titles\nTurkish words and phrases"}

They won Division Three at the first attempt and were promoted to Division Two. The club went on to win Division Two in 1996–97 to earn a second successive promotion, this time to Division One. A third successive promotion was secured when they finished third in Division One the 1997–98, resulting in promotion to the Premier Division.\n\nAt the end of the 2007–08 season Feckenham dropped two divisions, replacing their reserve team in Division Two. They were Division Two runners-up in 2010–11 and were promoted back to Division One. When the Midland Combination merged with the Midland Alliance to form the Midland League in 2014, Feckenham became members of Division Two of the new league. The club left the league at the end of the curtailed 2020–21 season. They subsequently joined Division Two West of the Hellenic League for the 2022–23 season, before transferring to Division Three of the Midland League at the end of the season.\n\nGround\n\nThe club played at Mill Lane until the first team were required to relocate in 1998 as the ground could not be brought up to the standard required to play in the Midland Combination Premier Division. They initially groundshared at Evesham United's Common Road ground, before moving to the Valley Stadium owned by Redditch United. After the club dropped out of the Premier Division in 2008 they returned to Mill Lane before moving to the Studley Sports & Social Club.\n\nHonours\nMidland Combination\nDivision Two champions 1996–97\nDivision Three champions 1995–96\nWorcester & District League\nChampions 1955–56, 1962–63, 1994–95\nBaylis Cup winners 1994–95\nRedditch & District League\nChampions 1920–21\nWorcestershire Minor Cup\nWinners 1978–79\nSmedley Crooke Memorial Challenge Cup\nWinner 1995–96, 1996–97\n\nSee also\nFeckenham F.C. players\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\nFootball clubs in England\nFootball clubs in Worcestershire\nAssociation football clubs established in 1881\n1881 establishments in England\nMidland Football Combination\nMidland Football League\nHellenic Football League"}

Its area is 862 km2, and its population is 23,499 (2022). The town itself has 10,293 inhabitants. It is on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, 47 km from the city of Adana, between the rivers Seyhan and Ceyhan, the Pyramos of Antiquity.\n\nHistory\n\nThe area has been inhabited from at least Hittite times and probably earlier. It was later part of the Assyrian province of Quwê (Que).  By the time of the Greeks, who knew the city as Megarsos/Magarso, there was a port here at the mouth of the navigable Pyramos, supplying an important military and trading route into the plain of Cilicia, and also providing access to the sea for the river towns, like Mallus.  In 333 BCE, just before the battle of Issus, Alexander the Great sacrificed here at a temple that, by interpretatio graeca, he took to be of Athena; the \"Athena of Magarsos\" who appears on Hellenistic coins has been diagnosed, from her pose and the attributes that surround her, to have Mesopotamian connections. Robin Lane Fox recognizes the origin of the cult site in the victories of Sennacherib, who instituted the shrine in 696 BCE following a sea battle with Greeks off the mouth of the river; he dedicated it to his martial goddess, Anat, or Ishtar.\n\nThe Romans rendered Magarsos as Megarsus.  The port was later conquered by the Arab armies during the growth of Islam and then by the Ottomans in 1517.\n\nKarataş was occupied by French troops during World War I.\n\nComposition\nThere are 43 neighbourhoods in Karataş District:\n\n Adalı\n Ataköy\n Bahçe\n Bebeli\n Çağşırlı\n Çakırören\n Çavuşlu\n Çimeli\n Çukurkamış\n Damlapınar\n Develiören\n Dolaplı\n Gölyaka\n Hacıhasan\n Hasırağacı\n Helvacı\n İnnaplıhüyüğü\n İsahacılı\n Kapı\n Karagöçer\n Karataş\n Karşıyaka\n Kemaliye\n Kesik\n Kiremitli\n Kırhasan\n Kızıltahta\n Konaklı\n Meletmez\n Orta\n Oymaklı\n Sarımsaklı\n Sirkenli\n Tabaklar\n Terliksiz\n Topraklı\n Tuzkuyusu\n Tuzla\n Yassıören\n Yemişli\n Yeni\n Yenimurat\n Yüzbaşı\n\nPlaces of interest\nThe ruins of churches, caravanserai, and an amphitheatre.

One night, when he follows his bum, he learns that there is a plot by bums to take over the world. Specifically, the bums plan to create a huge, worldwide fart by building up a massive quantity of methane gas in the \"Bumcano\". When the Bumcano blows, all humans will be rendered unconscious. While they are unconscious, the bums will seize their chance and switch places with their heads.\n\nFortunately, Zack meets the \"Bum-hunter\" Silas Sterne and his daughter, Eleanor, and is introduced to the realities of life in a world where bums are constantly a threat. To prevent the Bumcano eruption, the friends enlist the help of the Kisser, the Kicker, the Smacker and Ned Smelly. The characters encounter a variety of bum-related places and things, including the \"Great Windy Desert\", \"flying bum squadrons\", Stenchgantor The Great Unwiped Bum and the Great White Bum.\n\nNaturally, every possible opportunity for toilet humour is milked in this book for children, which won a number of Children's Choice awards in Australia.\n\nIt is followed by Zombie Bums from Uranus (2003) and Bumageddon: The Final Pongflict (2005).\n\nCharacters\nZack Freeman – a twelve-year-old boy, at the centre of the novel.\nDuce (Zack Freemans \"bum\") – the recruiter of the midnight bum rally, threatening to fill a Bumcano and knocking every human out on Earth to rearrange the place of heads and bums. Zack's bum is shocked by finding out that the Great White Bum was lying about the rearrangements and ends up becoming Zack's best friend.\nEleanor Sterne – a fierce bum fighter in her own right, Eleanor is determined to kill the Great White Bum after it killed her mother in a surprise attack on a family picnic when Eleanor was only five. Daughter of the legendary bum hunter, Silas Sterne. Eleanor is a friend of the B-team. Has a prosthetic or \"artificial\" bum.\nSilas Sterne – the bravest and most talented bum hunter in history. He is founder of Silas Sterne's Bum Fighting Academy. His wife was killed when he, her and his formidable daughter Eleanor were on a family picnic, after the Great White Bum uprising. Silas Sterne has hunted and captured some of the most dangerous bums ever. Silas was once a member of the famous B-team and a friend of Ned Smelly.\nKicker – a violent bum fighter is highly skilled in the art of foot to bum combat.  A member of the famous B-team, Kicker is always wanting to kick bums, rather than smack them or kiss them. He and the Kisser usually fight. Kicker is a huge man with a thick beard and the biggest feet ever. He wears Australian rules football shorts, jumper and boots. He always talks about kicking, bums and kicked bums.\nSmacker – a bum fighter, highly skilled in the art of hand to bum combat. A member of the famous B-team, Smacker is the most sensible member of the B-team, and good friend to Eleanor. She is a huge woman with black hair and has huge hands like baseball mitts. She wears an orange floral dress with short sleeves.\nKisser – a charming bum fighter, highly skilled in the art of lip to bum combat and a member of the famous B-team. Kidnapped by rogue bums, and becoming a secret bum-sympathiser, who not only tried to sabotage the B-teams plans, but also attempted to kill the other members while climbing up the Bumcano. He is last seen being dragged down by giant maggots in the brown lake.  Meanwhile, later in Zombie Bums from Uranus, he is known as the \"Mutant Maggot Lord\", and in Bumageddon as the \"Mutant Mutant Zombie Blowfly Spew Lord\" or \"Mutant Spew Lord\" for short.\nNed Smelly – an ex-bum fighter, who got his name after his run in with Stenchgantor, the Great Unwiped Bum. He lives in a shack in the Great Windy Desert, feeding on needleweeds and stinkants.  After eating anti-bum energy bars, his stench had disappeared.  He dies in Bumageddon: The Final Pongflict when the Mutant Spew Lord shot him in the back.\nCaptain Brown – a bum-shelter manager.\nStenchgantor – also known as the Great Unwiped Bum, the Stenchgantor was the ugliest, wartiest, hairiest, stinkiest bum ever, until it was out-stenched by Zack's stinky bumcatcher socks. The only bum to have a nostril, rather than an eye, he lives in the Brown Forest, completely blind as it relies on its sense of smell to catch victims.\nThe Great White Bum – an enormous bum, the evillest bum in history. Some say the Great White Bum was a mutant bum created by a side effect of a nuclear bum launcher. Others believe it was around for years. In his book, 'Chariots of the Bums', Eric Von Dunnycan (a parody of UFO enthusiast Erich von Däniken) claimed that it was a space traveller. It was forcibly removed from Earth by Zack Freeman, who sent it blasting into space.\nJudi and James Freeman – are Zack's parents who are first mentioned in The Day My Bum Went Psycho as travelling musicians. It is later revealed they are both bum-fighters in Zombie Bums from Uranus.\n\nTelevision series\n\nA television series based on the books started airing on the Australian channel Nine Network and on the Canadian channels Teletoon and Télétoon on June 12, 2014.\n\nLive adaption\nOn January 19, 2019, an adaptation written by author Dave Lowe premiered at Brisbane Arts Theatre.

As a songwriter, he was also often credited as Bill Everette.\n\nBiography\nJustis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, but grew up in Memphis, Tennessee and studied music at Christian Brothers College (high school department) and Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. A trumpet and saxophone player, while in university he performed with local jazz and dance bands. He returned home to Memphis in 1951 and was eventually taken on by Sam Phillips at Sun Records where he recorded music for himself as well as arranged the music for Sun artists such as Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Johnny Cash, and Charlie Rich, the latter of which he is credited with discovering. Released in November 1957, his song \"Raunchy\" was the first rock and roll instrumental hit, and its popularity was such that it reached #2 on the American Billboard chart by three different artists, Ernie Freeman for Imperial, and Billy Vaughn on Dot. It also reached #11 in the UK Singles Chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Justis had one other significant hit record, \"College Man\", that went to U.S. #42.\n\nIn 1961, Justis moved to Nashville where he became a successful record producer and music arranger for both pop and country music performers at Monument and Mercury Records and other labels. He played saxophone on the soundtrack for the 1964 Elvis Presley film, Kissin' Cousins and that same year took over as manager of the singing group, Ronny & the Daytonas.\n\nJustis had a number one hit in Australia in 1963 with \"Tamoure\". The song did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100. In the early 1960s he produced a successful series of instrumental albums on the Smash label (Alley Cat/Green Onions and Telstar/The Lonely Bull). Justis was credited by Ray Stevens in the TNN special, The Life and Times of Ray Stevens, for giving him the phrase \"gitarzan\", which became a million selling hit for Stevens in 1969.\n\nJustis also wrote the scores for several films including Dear Dead Delilah (1972), Smokey and the Bandit (1977), Hooper (1978), The Villain (1979), and Island Claws (1980).\n\nJustis died of cancer in Nashville in 1982, at the age of 55, and was interred in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n [ Allmusic biography]\n \n \n\n1926 births\n1982 deaths\n20th-century American composers\n20th-century American saxophonists\n20th-century trumpeters\n20th-century American male musicians\nAmerican trumpeters\nAmerican male trumpeters\nAmerican rock saxophonists\nAmerican male saxophonists\nAmerican male composers\nAmerican music arrangers\nChristian Brothers University alumni\nSun Records artists\nPhillips International Records artists\nSmash Records artists\nMonument Records artists\nMusicians from Birmingham, Alabama\nTulane University alumni\nDeaths from cancer in Tennessee\nBurials at Memorial Park Cemetery (Memphis, Tennessee)\nRock and roll musicians"}

They are currently members of the  and play at the Coppice.\n\nHistory\nThe club was established in 1948 by a group of former residents of the St Vincent's Home for Working Boys, run by Father Hudson's Society. They joined the South Birmingham League, before moving up to Division Two of the Worcestershire Combination in 1964. After finishing fourth in their first season in Division Two, the club were promoted to Division One.\n\nIn 1966–67 they reached the quarter-finals of the FA Amateur Cup; during the game against Enfield, several players collapsed after a lightning strike, and Highgate's Tony Allden died the next day. The game was abandoned and replayed at Villa Park, where a crowd of over 31,000 saw Enfield win 6–0.\n\nThe 1970s was the most successful era in Highgate United's history; in 1972–73 the club were champions of the renamed Midland Combination, also winning the League Cup and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Amateur Cup, losing 4–0 in a replay to Walton & Hersham at Selhurst Park after the first match at Highfield Road had ended 0–0. They retained the league title and the League Cup the following season, also winning the Birmingham Senior Cup with a 3–2 win over Darlaston. The club won a third consecutive Midland Combination title in 1974–75 and went on to win the League Cup in 1975–76 and 1976–77.\n\nHighgate were Division One runners-up in 1981–82 and League Cup winners in 1984–85. They finished bottom of the (renamed) Premier Division in 1994–95, but avoided being relegated as the division was expanded from 18 to 20 clubs.

{"id": "4105068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free%20Church%20Federation", "title": "Free Church Federation", "text": "Free Church Federation is a voluntary association of British Nonconformist churches for cooperation in religious social work. It was the outcome of a unifying tendency displayed during the latter part of the 19th century.\n\nHistory\nAbout 1890 the proposal that there should be a Nonconformist Church Congress analogous to the Anglican Church Congress was seriously considered, and the first was held in Manchester on 7 November 1892. In the following year it was resolved that the basis of representation should be neither personal (as in the Anglican Church Congress) nor denominational, but territorial. Subsequently, England and Wales were completely covered with a network of local councils, each of which elected its due proportion of representatives to the national gathering. This territorial arrangement eliminated all sectarian distinctions, and also the possibility of committing the different churches as such to any particular policy. The representatives of the local councils attended not as denominationalists but as Evangelical Free Churchmen.\n\nThe name of the organization was changed from Congress to National Council as soon as the assembly consisted of duly appointed representatives from the local councils of every part of England. The local councils consisted of representatives of the Congregational and Baptist Churches, the Methodist Churches, the Presbyterian Church of England, the Free Church of England, the Society of Friends, and such other Evangelical churches as the National Council may at any time have admitted. The constitution stated the following as the objects of the National Council: (a) To facilitate fraternal intercourse and cooperation among the Evangelical Free Churches; (b) to assist in the organization of local councils; (c) to encourage devotional fellowship and mutual counsel concerning the spiritual life and religious activities of the Churches; (d) to advocate the New Testament doctrine of the Church, and to defend the rights of the associated Churches; (e) to promote the application of the law of Christ in every relation of human life. Although the objects of the Free Church councils were thus in their nature and spirit religious rather than political, there were occasions on which action was taken on national affairs of significant import. Thus, opposition was offered to the Education Act of 1902, and support accorded during the general election of 1906 to those candidates who pledged themselves to altering that measure.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century it was recognised that a further mechanism was needed to handle Free Church issues at a denominational level. This was something that the Free Church Council was not established to do. Having seen the process hindered by World War I, the first meeting of the Federal Council of the Evangelical Free Churches took place in October 1919. The two councils then ran on parallel lines until they combined in 1940 to form the Free Church Federal Council to oversee both the local groups and denominational issues.\n\nAlthough the Free Church Federal Council was not one of the founding interdenominational bodies of the British Council of Churches in 1942, in 1972 a number of member denominations of the Free Church Federal Council were invited into discussions by two of its member denominations, the Presbyterian Church of England and the Congregational Church, that had recently come together to form the United Reformed Church.\n\nThe Free Church Federal Council trod a careful path when the ecumenical process Not Strangers but Pilgrims began in 1986, leaving with its member denominations the choice of participating. It was more supportive when the British Council of Churches handed over its activities in September 1990 at the inauguration of the national bodies: Churches Together in England (CTE), Churches Together in Wales (CYTUN), and Action of Churches Together in Scotland (ACTS); and to the ‘four-nations’ body, Churches Together in Britain and Island. In particular the Free Church Federal Council has from the outset supplied its Moderator to serve as the Free Churches President of CTE alongside the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster, and has forged close relationships with CYTUN. It has also has offered CTE the use of its premises and seen many of its local groups play a major part in establishing local Churches Together Groups.\n\nIn March 2016 the Free Church Federal Council updated its governing documents in order to better serve the interests of the Free Churches Group, the growing body of member denominations that the Free Church Federal Council convenes.\n\nService\nA striking feature of the movement from its outset was the adoption of the parochial system for the purpose of local work. Each of the associated churches was requested to look after a parish, not of course with any attempt to exclude other churches, but as having a special responsibility for those in that area who were not already connected with some existing church. Throughout the United Kingdom local councils were formed into federations, some fifty in number, which were intermediate between them and the National Council. The local councils did what was possible to prevent overlapping and excessive competition between the churches. They also combined the forces of the local churches for evangelistic and general devotional work, open-air services, efforts on behalf of Sunday observance, and the prevention of gambling. Services were arranged in connection with workhouses, hospitals and other public institutions.\n\nSocial work of a varied character formed a large part of the operations of the local councils, and the Free Church Girls Guild had a function similar to that of the Anglican Girls' Friendly Society. The National Council engaged in missionary work on a large scale, and a considerable number of periodicals, hymn-books for special occasions, and works of different kinds explaining the history and ideals of the Evangelical Free Churches were published. At its height the churches represented in the National Council had 9,966 ministers, 55,828 local preachers, 407,991 Sunday school teachers, 3,416,377 Sunday scholars, 2,178,221 communicants, and sitting accommodation for 8,555,460 (as of 1911).\n\nA remarkable manifestation of this unprecedented reunion was the fact that a committee of the associated churches prepared and published a catechism expressing the positive and fundamental agreement of all the Evangelical Free Churches on the essential doctrines of Christianity. The catechism represented substantially the creed of not less than 80,000,000 Protestants. It was widely circulated throughout Great Britain, the Commonwealth and the United States of America, and was also translated into Welsh, French, and Italian.\n\nBy the time the Free Church Council combined with the Council of Evangelical Free Churches, a strong foundation had been laid for future progress and some significant benefactors came behind the project to make sure that the corporate voice of the Free Churches could continue to be heard. A residential block was built on the north side of Tavistock Square in London to provide an income and a headquarters for the organisation. The work in education continued and member denominations opened the way for ministers of other member denominations to join them in providing chaplaincy, notably the Methodist Church with prison chaplaincy. Member denominations took it in turn to provide a Moderator and the organisation employed a General Secretary and members of staff.\n\nBy the time the revised governing documents were adopted in 2016, the Free Church Federal Council had three specialist secretaries, one for Education (including Education chaplaincy), one for Prison Chaplaincy and one for Health Care Chaplaincy, in addition to a General Secretary and support staff. In 2018 it instigated the Free Churches Commission on the Church and Social Cohesion which published its report ‘Connecting Communities and Serving People’ in November 2020 and continues to promote faithful witness in the public square.\n\nGrowth\nThe movement spread to all parts of Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Jamaica, the U.S., and India. It is perhaps necessary to add that it differs essentially from the Evangelical Alliance, inasmuch as its membership since the formation of the federal council is primarily at a denominational level rather than a congregational or personal level. The essential doctrine of the movement is a particular understanding of the Church which regards the Lord Jesus Christ as the sole and Divine Head of every branch of the Holy Catholic Church throughout the world. For this reason those denominations that do not accept the deity of Christ within a Trinitarian theology are necessarily excluded from membership of the Free Churches Group. At the time of publishing the report of its commission, the total number of member denominations within the Free Churches Group was twenty six: the Methodist Church, the Baptist Union of Great Britain, the United Reformed Church, the Salvation Army,  the Assemblies of God, the Congregational Federation, the Baptist Union of Wales, Christ Apostolic Church, Church of God of Prophecy,  Church of The Nazarene, Churches in Communities International, the Council of African & Caribbean Churches UK, the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, the Fellowship of Churches of Christ, the Free Church of England, the Free Methodist Church, the Independent Methodist Connexion, the Joint Council of Churches for All Nations, the Moravian Church, the New Testament Assembly, the New Testament Church of God, the Old Baptist Union, the Order of St Leonard, the Presbyterian Church of Wales, the Union of Welsh Independents and the Wesleyan Reform Union.\n\nSee also\nFree church\nAlexander Mackennal\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nFree Churches Group\nEkklesia article on Free Churches\n\nChristian organisations based in the United Kingdom\nProtestant organizations\nNonconformism\nProtestant ecumenism"}

{"id": "4105099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ka%C5%9F", "title": "Kaş", "text": "Kaş (; ) is a small fishing, diving, yachting and tourist town, and a municipality and district of Antalya Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,750 km2, and its population is 62,866 (2022). It is 168 km west of the city of Antalya. As a tourist resort, it is relatively unspoiled.\n\nHistory \nAlthough the Teke peninsula has been occupied since the Stone Age, it seems Kaş was founded by the Lycians, and its name in Lycian language was Habesos or Habesa. It was a member of the Lycian League, and its importance during this time is confirmed by the presence of one of the richest Lycian necropoleis.\n\nIn the Hellenistic period and under the Roman Empire it served as the port of Phellus. For information on its history at that time and on its archaeological remains, see the article on Antiphellus, the name by which it was known at that time.\n\nThe town suffered because of Arab incursions, then was annexed (under the name of Andifli) to the Anatolian Sultanate of Rum, led by the Seljuks. After the demise of the Seljuks, it came under the Ottomans.\n\nIn 1923, because of the forcible exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey after the Greco-Turkish War, population of Greek origin in the area left for Greece.\n\nIn the early 1990s tourism started booming in Kaş, with visitors mainly from the UK and Germany. This growth of tourism brought an explosion in apartment building (often without license), which is seriously threatening the landscape and the environment. Particularly affected is the Çukurbağ Peninsula, west of the town, which now has luxury hotels built on it.\n\nGeography \nAs the tenth most populous district of Antalya as of 2022, Kaş is on a hill running down to the Turquoise Coast of southwestern Turkey. The district has a typical Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, which allows the growth of oranges, lemons and bananas. The lowland areas are also planted with cut flowers and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Many are grown all year round under glass. The hillsides produce honey and almonds, while at high altitudes there are extensive pine forests. The weather is drier at high altitudes. Although agriculture is still important, tourism is the main source of income in the district, which has many hotels and guest houses.\n\nAbout  offshore from Kaş is the Greek islet of Kastelórizo (in Turkish Meis Adası)  served by a Turkish  ferry daily with the option of same day returns.\n\nComposition\nThere are 54 neighbourhoods in Kaş District:\n\n Ağullu\n Ahatlı\n Aklar\n Akörü\n Bayındır\n Beldibi\n Belenli\n Belkonak\n Bezirgan\n Boğazcık\n Çamlıköy\n Çamlıova\n Çataloluk\n Çavdır\n Çayköy\n Cemre\n Çerler\n Çeşmeköy\n Çukurbağ\n Dereköy\n Dirgenler\n Doğantaş\n Gelemiş\n Gökçeören\n Gökçeyazı\n Gömbe\n Gürsu\n Hacıoğlan\n İkizce\n İslamlar\n Kalkan\n Karadağ\n Kasaba\n Kemerköy\n Kılıçlı\n Kılıçlıyayla\n Kınık\n Kızılağaç\n Merkez\n Ortabağ\n Ova\n Palamutköy\n Pınarbaşı\n Sarıbelen\n Sarılar\n Sinneli\n Sütleğen\n Uğrar\n Üzümlü\n Yaylapalamut\n Yeniköy\n Yeşilbarak\n Yeşilköy\n Yuvacık\n\nTourism \nThe tourist industry is centered on the pleasant town of Kaş, but many other coastal towns and villages in the district have plenty of accommodation for visitors including Kalkan and Gelemiş. The district can be reached from both Antalya and Dalaman airports, as there is no airport in Kaş.\n\nKaş itself is a quiet pleasant town with its turquoise blue sea and narrow streets scented with jasmine flowers. There are plenty of little guest houses, quiet cafes serving home cooking, or small bars to relax and listen to live music after a day's scuba diving. Kaş has an annual arts festival, jazz concerts in the Hellenistic theatre and the Kiln Under the Sea arts collective have held underwater ceramics exhibitions here.\n\nKaş is one of the leading spots for scuba diving in Turkey. Its visited by beginners as well as advanced divers. There are more than 15 dive centers and diving schools, mostly located at the local port. They offer guided diving trips to the 50 dive spots in the vicinity. Diving in Kaş offers an array of fish and other sea creatures like octopus and sea turtles.\n\nBesides the biological diversity, Kaş offers a vast variety of underwater cultural heritage. Among various wreck sites, six artificial wrecks are worth visiting. These wrecks are submerged to create artificial reefs and touristic diving spots. There are two historically important wreck sites, an airplane from World War II and a cargo ship from the 1950s sunk near the small islands in the extremities of Kaş. One last important diving spot is the \"Kaş Archaeopark Site\", an experimental archaeology project conducted by the Underwater Research Society (Sualtı Araştırmaları Derneği-SAD) in 2006. In this scientific project, an interpretative reconstruction of the Uluburun wreck and its cargo is placed underwater.\n\nOutdoor sport activities attract the more adventurous visitors of Kaş, especially small group holidays from Europe and independent travellers. Popular adventures include: \nSea Kayaking at Kekova\nMountainbiking the backcountry\nTrekking the Lycian Way\nCanyoning in the Kibris Canyon\n\nOn Fridays, Greek visitors from Kastelorizo visit the markets of Kaş, including the central city market full local products and produce grown in the surrounding villages.\n\nDemographics \nThe district has a population of 62,866 (2022). The town itself has 9,084 inhabitants. Other larger settlements are Kınık and Ova.\n\nPlaces of interest \n\n The town of Kaş has a Hellenistic theatre and many other places of historical interest, as well as beaches, and a number of caves, some of them underwater.\nFor scuba divers there are several spots underwater, one of them being an underwater sculpture of a shark sculpted by Kemal Tufan and another being a submerged Douglas DC-3 plane.\nBeaches worth visiting: Kaputaş Plajı, small Seyrekcakil Plaji or Belediyesi Halk Plajı\n For sailors, a new marina with facilities for short and long stay has been opened.\n The mountains behind the coast have places for trekking, climbing and canyoning.\n The ruins of the antique cities of Komba (in the village of Gömbe), Nisa, Kandyba, Phellos, Istlada, Apollonia, Isinda and Kyaenai.\n A common excursion from Kaş is Kekova island in the neighbouring district of Demre. Here in the bays there are a number of wrecks of ancient ships and ancient cities sunk under the sea by earthquakes over the centuries. The sea is so clear that the details of city buildings such as staircases or columns can be seen from the boat. The area is also used for sea kayaking. In December 2006, Kaş was added to the specially protected Kekova marine area in order to preserve its rich biodiversity.\n\nPanorama\n\nSee also \n\n Kaputaş Beach\n Kalkan\n Turkish Riviera\n Marinas in Turkey\n Foreign purchases of real estate in Turkey\nMeis–Kaş Swim\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links \n\n Information on Kaş from Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism\n Link to 150 pictures that does work\n\n \nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nTurkish Riviera\nPopulated coastal places in Turkey\nMediterranean port cities and towns in Turkey\nPopulated places in Antalya Province\nFishing communities in Turkey\nDistricts of Antalya Province\nPopulated places in ancient Lycia\nFormer Greek towns in Turkey"}

They were the first general elections after South Africa became a republic following the 1960 South African referendum. The National Party under Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd won a majority in the House of Assembly.\n\nThe National Union Party - led by J.D. du P. Basson and ex-Chief Justice Henry Allan Fagan in alliance with the United Party - had been formed as a \"bridge\" to the United Party for moderate nationalists who were unhappy with Verwoerd's leadership, but the party failed and later merged with the United Party.\n\nThe elections also saw the first general election appearance of the liberal Progressive Party, which had broken away from the United Party in 1959. The new party retained one MP, in the form of Helen Suzman. She was to remain its sole parliamentary representative until 1974.\n\nChanges in franchise\n\nEnd of black representation\n\nDuring the previous Parliament the seats of the three MPs and four Senators representing black South Africans had been abolished. The 1961 election produced the first Parliament with no representation at all for black South Africans.\n\nColoured Representative Members\n\nThe second election for the four Coloured representative members took place on 4 October 1961, before the (white voters only) general election on 18 October 1961. Under the Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951, the members were to serve until the dissolution of the new Parliament.\n\nThe four seats were won by Independents, with United Party support. The recently formed Progressive Party did not contest the four vacancies.\n\nReduction in voting age\n\nThis was the first election after the passage of the Electoral Law Amendment Act, No. 30 of 1958, which reduced the voting age for white voters from 21 to 18.\n\nDelimitation of electoral divisions\n\nThe South Africa Act 1909 had provided for a delimitation commission to define the boundaries for each electoral division, for general roll voters in the four provinces. The representation by province, under the eleventh delimitation report of 1958, is set out in the table below. The figures in brackets are the number of electoral divisions in the previous (1953) delimitation. If there is no figure in brackets then the number was unchanged.\n\nThis was only the second general election, in South African history, where the boundaries were unchanged from the previous election.\n\nComposition at the dissolution\n\nAt the end of the 12th Parliament elected since the Union of 1910, when it was dissolved in 1961, the House of Assembly consisted of two groups of members. White voters were represented by 156 general roll members and coloured voters in Cape Province by four white MPs known at the time as Coloured Representative Members (CRM).\n\nThe general election only affected the representatives of white voters.

The supporting cast features Oskar Homolka, Felix Bressart, Sig Rumann and Eve Arden. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career.\n\nPlot\nIn the Soviet Union, American reporter McKinley \"Mac\" Thompson (Clark Gable) secretly writes unflattering stories about the Soviet Union, attributed to \"Comrade X\", for his newspaper. His identity is discovered by his valet, Vanya (Felix Bressart), who blackmails Mac into promising to get his daughter, a streetcar conductor named Theodore (Hedy Lamarr), out of the country. Theodore agrees to a sham marriage so she can spread the message of the benefits of Communism to the rest of the world. However, Commissar Vasiliev (Oscar Homolka) is determined to unmask and arrest Comrade X.

He was known for playing supporting roles in several major studio films from 1969 to 1979, and he appeared in many television shows and TV movies.\n\nEarly life\nWilliam Hopkins was born in Greenville, South Carolina. At the age of nine months, he was adopted by a couple who were unable to conceive. Growing up, he was called \"Billy.\" His adoptive father worked in a mill in Taylors, South Carolina. When his father was 39, he died of a heart attack on the porch of the family's home. Billy and his mother witnessed his death. Unable to remain in their house, a month later the two of them moved to a new residence in nearby Ware Shoals, where his grandfather and uncles worked in another mill. His mother eventually remarried a man whose last name was Davis. Hopkins did not get along with his new stepfather; the two got into numerous arguments, some serious. After running away from home a few times, he was sent to live with his grandparents, and while there he learned that he had been adopted because his adoptive mother could not bear children. At age 12, he met his birth mother who lived with his half-sisters and a half-brother in Lockhart, another small mill town in South Carolina.\n\nBilly led a troubled life as a youngster, with numerous instances of truancy, minor crimes, and a stay in a reform school. He dropped out of school just before his 17th birthday and joined the United States Army, where he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division. He was based at Fort Jackson, Fort Gordon, and Fort Pope, before being shipped off to Korea, where he served for nine months.\n\nExplaining in a 2012 magazine interview how he got his first name \"Bo,\" he said:\n\nCareer  \nHopkins appeared in more than 100 film and television roles in a career of more than 40 years, including the major studio films The Wild Bunch (1969), The Bridge at Remagen (1969), The Getaway (1972), American Graffiti (1973), The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (1973), The Killer Elite (1975), Posse (1975), A Small Town in Texas (1976), Midnight Express (1978), and More American Graffiti (1979).  His final film, Hillbilly Elegy, was directed by his long-time friend Ron Howard and released in 2020.\n\nAfter Hopkins' first roles in major films in the early 1970s he appeared in White Lightning (1973). Hopkins played Roy Boone. Jerry Reed and Hopkins played brothers Joe Hawkins and Tom Hawkins in the 1985 film What Comes Around.\n\nHopkins starred or co-starred in many made-for-television movies of the mid-1970s, including Gondola (1973), Judgment: The Court Martial of Lieutenant William Calley (1975), The Runaway Barge (1975), The Kansas City Massacre (1975), The Invasion of Johnson County (1976), Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway (1976), Woman on the Run (1977), Thaddeus Rose and Eddie (1978), Crisis in Sun Valley (1978), and The Busters (1978).\n\nWhen Gretchen Corbett left the television series The Rockford Files in 1978, Hopkins replaced her character as Rockford's attorney John Cooper, ultimately appearing in three episodes. In 1981, Hopkins appeared in the first season of the prime time drama Dynasty as Matthew Blaisdel. His many other appearances on television included in miniseries Aspen (1977) and Beggarman, Thief (1979), and in episodes of Gunsmoke, Bonanza, The Wild Wild West, The Virginian, Nichols, The Rat Patrol (replacing Justin Tarr as the jeep driver for three episodes), The Mod Squad, Hawaii Five-O, Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers, The Rookies, Charlie's Angels, Fantasy Island, The A-Team, Scarecrow and Mrs. King, The Fall Guy, Crazy Like a Fox, Murder, She Wrote, and Doc Elliot. Hopkins portrayed a role in the video game Nuclear Strike. He plays Colonel LeMonde, a mercenary who steals a nuclear weapon. The \"Strike\" team tracks him through Southeast Asia.\n\nPersonal life  \nAfter his military service, William \"Billy\" Hopkins began dating Norma Woodle, whom he married at age 21, and they had a daughter in July 1960.\n\nHopkins became interested in pursuing an acting career, but his wife disapproved of it and she soon left him, taking their daughter with her. After appearing in some area plays, he received a scholarship to study acting and stage production at the Pioneer Playhouse in Kentucky, where he soon moved. From Kentucky, he made his way to Manhattan to act in more stage plays. After that, he moved to Hollywood with his cousin's boyfriend, who wanted to be a stuntman. He earned a living parking cars while studying at the Actors Studio, where one of his classmates was Martin Landau.\n\nHopkins had a two-year relationship with Gondola co-star Sondra Locke. They presented themselves as a couple on the game show Tattletales despite her existing marriage. Their episode aired just days before she left for Arizona to start shooting The Outlaw Josey Wales.\n\nHopkins was married to Sian Eleanor Green from 1989 until his death; they had a son in 1995. After six years of professional inactivity, Hopkins returned to acting, reading scripts, and was writing his autobiography.\n\nDeath \nHopkins died on May 28, 2022 after suffering a heart attack.

Griff's home kit is blue and white vertical striped shirts, with blue shorts, accompanied by blue socks. This combination has been used since the club formed in 1972.\n\nHistory\nThe club was founded in 1972 as Nuneaton Amateurs when a dispute at the well-known local club Co-op Sports F.C. led to many members moving to the Nuneaton Griff and Coton Miners Welfare Ground. Nine players and officials paid £1 each to start the new club and Colin Wetton became the first manager, with Colin Rathbone as chairman.\n\nThe Amateurs initially played in the Coventry and North Warwickshire League, and in their first season were denied a championship success when their opponents failed to turn up for a late-season rescheduled game and the Coventry and North Warwickshire League decided there was not time to fit in another match.\n\nBy the 1990s the club was playing in the Coventry Alliance Football League, where they were dominant for a number of years. In 1998–99 the decision was made to apply for membership of the Midland Football Combination.\n\nThe club was controversially placed directly into the Premier Division but the Heartlanders, under manager Mark Green, repaid that faith by winning the championship in their first season 1999–2000 and repeated the feat the following season 2000–01, adding the Endsleigh Challenge Cup for good measure. In the process they made history by winning the Challenge Cup at Villa Park and the following night winning the Coventry Telegraph Cup at Highfield Road, Coventry, to become the only club ever to play in two cup finals on consecutive days at two different Premier League football grounds win them both.\n\nIn 2014 they were placed into the newly formed Midland Football League Division One. In the 2015-16 season the club reached the fifth round of the FA Vase for the first time, where they lost 3-0 to Salisbury at home in front of a record crowd of 870.\n\nHonours\nMidland Combination Premier Division\nWinners: 1999–2000, 2000–01\nRunners-up: 2010–11\nMidland Combination Challenge Cup\nWinners: 2000–01\nMidland Combination Glover Rowley Team of the Year\nWinners: 2000–01\nCoventry Alliance Premier Division\nWinners: 1996–97, 1997–98\nRunners-up: 1998–99\nCoventry Alliance Premier Division Cup\nWinners: 1996–97, 1997–98\nBirmingham County Junior Cup\nWinners: 1998–99\nFinalists: 1999–2000\nBirmingham County Saturday Vase\nFinalists: 2000–01\nBirmingham County Midweek Floodlit Cup\nFinalists: 2003–04, 2010–11, 2015-16\nCoventry Telegraph Cup\nWinners: 1972–73, 1996–97, 2000–01, 2001–02, 2008–09\nCoventry Charity Cup\nWinners: 1998–99, 1999–2000\nMidland Combination Programme of the Year\nWinners: 2007–08, 2009–10, 2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–13, 2013–14\nSoccer Club Swap Shop\nMFC Programme of the Season: 2007–08\nCoventry Telegraph Junior Cup\nWinners: 2008–09, 2014-15\nFoleshill Charity Cup\nWinners: 1989–90, 1997–98, 1999–2000\nRoy Jones Memorial Cup\nWinners: 2010-11\nCoventry Alliance Fair Play Award\nWinners: 2009–10\nNuneaton Cannon Sports 6-A-Side Champions Cup\nWinners: 2013\n\nRecords\nBest league performance: Midland Combination Premier Division champions, 1999–2000 and 2000–01\nBest FA Cup performance: Second Qualifying Round 2012–13\nBest FA Vase performance: Fifth Round, 2015–16\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMidland Football Combination\nAssociation football clubs established in 1972\nFootball clubs in Warwickshire\n1972 establishments in England\nMidland Football League\nSport in Nuneaton\nFootball clubs in England\nCoventry Alliance Football League"}

{"id": "4105154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemaliye", "title": "Kemaliye", "text": "Kemaliye, formerly Eğin (, meaning \"spring\"), is a town in Erzincan Province in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. It is the seat of Kemaliye District. Its population is 2,536 (2022).\n\nThe town is known for its historic architecture, including many Ottoman-era houses. It is also notable for its commanding view of the river Karasu (Euphrates) flowing south through a gorge above the Keban Dam. The town consists of 11 quarters: Dörtyolağzı, Gençağa, Ariki, Hacıyusuf, Halilağa, Naip, Bahçe, Sandıkbağı, Taşdibi, Isakpaşa and Esertepe.\n\nHistory\nEğin may have been founded by Paulician Armenian Christians in the 9th century. Certainly, a Paulician state was headquartered at nearby Tephrike (modern Divriği) by 844.\n\nAlternatively, the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica reports that Eğin was settled by Armenians who emigrated from Van in the 11th century with Senekherim (presumably Seneqerim-Hovhannes of Vaspurakan of the Artsruni dynasty).\n\nEğin became known as a center of Armenian musicians, and later, literary poets.\n\nIn 1813, James Playfair's \"A System of Geography\" described Eğin as \"[A] little town in the form of an amphitheatre, at the foot of a mountain, in a fruitful tract that reaches to the Euphrates.\"\n\nThe British explorer Francis Rawdon Chesney followed the course of the Euphrates for a survey expedition between 1835 and 1837, and mentions Eğin as \"a town of 2700 houses on the right bank\". In comparison, he counts about 3000 houses in Erzincan and 2923 families in Malatya. Chesney describes Eğin's situation in a deep valley where the \"mountains rise to about 4000 feet on each side of this singular fissure, which is so narrow that it is crossed by a bridge between lofty limestone precipices seeming to overhang the town and as it were to threaten its destruction.\"\n\nIn 1895, the British geographer Charles William Wilson describes Eğin as follows in a travel guide to Asia Minor:\n\nArmenian historian Vahakn Dadrian reports that in 1896, the town was evenly divided between Armenians and Muslims (Turks and Kurds). He says that Eğin was notable for its prosperity and had previously escaped the 1895–1896 Hamidian massacres through a ransom payment by the Armenians of 1500 Turkish gold pounds. However, British archaeologist David George Hogarth writing for the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica noted a massacre of Armenians in Eğin on November 8, 1895.\n\nAlthough Dadrian reports that Eğin escaped during the Hamidian massacres, he says it was less fortunate when the Ottoman government retaliated for the 1896 Ottoman Bank Takeover by Armenian Dashnaks (itself a response to the Hamidian massacres). On September 15, 1896, three weeks after the Ottoman Bank Takeover, Ottoman troops killed \"upwards of 2,000 Armenians\" including \"many women and children\" according to a report by the French Ambassador. Of the 1,500 houses located in the Armenian quarter of Eğin, 980 were pillaged and burned. Eğin was chosen to be the target of the massacre because the leader of the bank raiding party, Papken Siuni, was a native of Eğin. According to a report by the British Consul at Harput, the pretext used to attack the town's Armenian quarter was that the Armenians of the town were \"set to cause trouble\". The same report by the Consul said that there were no revolutionary movement whatever and no powder magazine exploded during the massacre. A few pistols and revolvers were found in the ruins of the burnt houses. Hogarth's report for the Encyclopædia Britannica 15 years later also notes a massacre of Armenians at Eğin \"in the summer of 1896\".\n\nBy 1911, Hogarth estimated the population of Eğin at 20,000 and assessed them as \"fairly evenly divided between Armenian Christians and Muslims\". He described Eğin as an important town in the Mamuretülaziz Vilayet \"...picturesquely situated in a theatre of lofty, abrupt rocks, on the right bank of the western Euphrates, which is crossed by a wooden bridge. The stone houses stand in terraced gardens and orchards, and the streets are mere rock ladders.\"\n\nOn 21 October 1922, following the Turkish War of Independence, a decree was issued renaming Eğin as Kemaliye (and Selinti as Gazipaşa) in honor of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. The former name is still known and used locally and sometimes even beyond. Kemaliye was administered as part of Elazığ Province until 1926, and within Malatya Province between 1926 and 1938. In 1938 it was transferred to Erzincan Province.\n\nThe 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey (Greek: Ἡ Ἀνταλλαγή, Turkish: Mübâdele) stemmed from the \"Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations\" signed at Lausanne, Switzerland, on 30 January 1923, by the governments of Greece and Turkey, had as result the evacuation of Egin from its Armenian-speaking Greek Orthodox minority population, inhabited there.

Its area is 681 km2, and its population is 114,250 (2022).

İzmir-Ankara highway crosses the district area  to the north of the district center. Kemalpaşa district borders on the district Bornova to the west, Yunusemre, Şehzadeler and Turgutlu (Manisa Province) in the north and east, and İzmir's districts of Torbalı and Bayındır in the south. The eastern and southern parts of Kemalpaşa district preserve their markedly rural characteristics, which results in an urbanization rate of only 25.7 for the district area as a whole, despite the presence of a strong industrial base in and to the west of Kemalpaşa town. Kemalpaşa's very large organized industrial zone (KOSBİ) brings together producers of construction materials, rubber and plastic goods, textiles and clothing, leather, paper, packaging materials, machinery and other equipment, including electrical tools and installations, dyes and other chemical substances, marble and car parts, as well as foundries and other metalworks.  Agriculture also occupies a portion with high added value in Kemalpaşa's economy, its cherries being of nationwide renown (known as Kemalpaşa kirazı in Turkish) and exported. Literacy is at a high level at 90%, and the neighboring Bornova, where Ege University is based, serves as a nearby pool in terms of trained personnel.\n\nAdministration \nA township depending the sanjak (subprovince) of Saruhan (Manisa) until the late-Ottoman times, the town was attached to the subprovince of İzmir in 1900 and a municipal administration was constituted the year after.\n\nThere are 49 neighbourhoods in Kemalpaşa District:\n\n 8 Eylül\n Akalan\n Ansızca\n Armutlu 85.

The recorded history dates back to 1300 BC. The Karabel relief depicting a Hittite warrior was until recently the only trace of that civilization discovered in western Anatolia. The recent discovery and the explorations that are currently being conducted in the prehistoric mound (höyük) near the depending municipality of Ulucak (Ulucak Höyüğü), is likely to shed new lights to the region's earlier history. There are also numerous tumuli in the Lydian style in the region.\n\nKarabel Hittite-Luwian rock relief \nThe relief is a late Hittite-Luwian rock relief about 1.5 meter wide and 2.5 meters high and located in a passage between two mountains on the road south to Torbalı at a distance of six kilometers from Kemalpaşa center. It is dated to the second half of the 13th century BCE during the reign of Tudhaliya IV. A male figure depicted standing with a bow in his right hand and a spear in his left wearing a tunic and a cone-shaped hat is identified as Tarkasnawa, King of Mira, according to a recent reading by David Hawkins, widely approved by scholars and matched with a name mentioned in Hattusa Hittite annals. The relief is called \"Eti Baba\" (the Hittite father) locally.\n\nNymphaion – Nif – Kemalpaşa \n\nThe town's name in classical and medieval times was Nymphaion (). It rose to prominence during the late Byzantine times, when it became the favourite winter residence of the Nicaean emperors during the 13th century. A palace, whose well-preserved remains are still extant, was built there by John III Doukas Vatatzes. The association with the Nicaean court made Nymphaion a center of imperial politics: the city was raised to an archbishopric, where John III spent his final months, and both Theodore II Laskaris and Michael VIII Palaiologos were crowned. The two 13th-century important treaties in 1214 and 1261 both referred to as Treaty of Nymphaeum were concluded there with the Italian states. The latter was to have an important impact on the region's future, virtually ceding Smyrna to the Republic of Genoa. In the last decades of the 13th century, it became a major Byzantine stronghold against the advances of the Turkish beyliks: both emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and the celebrated general Alexios Philanthropenos used it as their headquarters in the 1290s. The town fell to the Turkish Bey of Saruhan in 1315. From 1867 until 1922, Nif was part of Aidin Vilayet.\n\nUnder Turkish rule, the town's original name was echoed in the Turkish name \"Nif\" which was in use until the early years of the Republic of Turkey. The name Nif was changed to Kemalpaşa in honor of Mustafa Kemal Paşa who had spent the night of 9 September 1922 here, before the closing chapter of the Occupation of Smyrna the next day, putting an end to the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) in the field. The name \"Nif\" is no longer used for the city, even colloquially, although its status of former name is common knowledge. Nif was one of the centers that were densely populated by Anatolian Greeks till the first quarter of the 20th century, before the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations.\n\nThe mountain on the slopes of which the city of Kemalpaşa extends and the district's most important stream are still called Nif (respectively, Nif Dağı and Nif Çayı). With its summit reaching 1.510 meters high, Mount Nif was one of the mountains called Olympus in ancient times and is renowned today for its dense forests of oaks, oleasters, pines and other trees of the Aegean basin, cold springs and trout farms. The River Nif enters the district area near the township of Ulucak, crosses the plain to skip tangentially into the area of the neighboring district of Bornova, at which level a Roman bridge is found, rejoins Kemalpaşa to flow into Gediz River further north near Manisa.\n\nIndustry and professions \n\nThere are 306 large industrial enterprises based in Kemalpaşa district and the share of the population employed directly or indirectly in industrial activities reaches 60%. The organized industrial zone KOSBİ gathers on its own 236 large enterprises, 7 with full and 41 with partial foreign capital.\n\nThe total number of companies based in Kemalpaşa district is 14.831. 463 of these are enterprises active in industrial sectors and 183 are registered exporters, the rest being accounted by establishments oriented towards services or agriculture. 8 banks are present in Kemalpaşa district with a total of 9 branches.\n\nCherries, livestock breeding, and forestry \nThe share of the population in Kemalpaşa district who pull their income from agriculture or animal breeding is 60%. Kemalpaşa region is well known for its cherries (Kemalpaşa kirazı in Turkish). 9 cooperatives set up for purposes of irrigation regulation and 6 others with agricultural development as objective bring together 3.137 persons. A large part of the land in Kemalpaşa district (1.310 hectares) is irrigated or has the infrastructure for regular irrigation, which explains the primary place occupied by maize among the grains produced, making Kemalpaşa an exceptional case in western Anatolia. The Union of Cherry Producers has 177 members, mostly large-scale producers. 1.594.600 cherry trees in total produced 47.838 tonnes of fruit in 2006 for Kemalpaşa. The increase compared to 2002 in the number of trees was 71.9% and in production 106.3%.\n\nAt about 2.500 hectares each, the respective shares of agricultural lands and forests in Kemalpaşa are roughly equal. Among the lands used for agriculture, fruit orchards, principally cherries, take the lead at 33% (758 hectares), with olive trees (22%, 400 hectares) and vineyards (16%, 370 hectares) following. The portion occupied by vineyards and grains more than halved between 2000 and 2006, while the land used for the production of cherries doubled. Since cherries are relatively easier to maintain and process, and a large national and export market exists, their production increasingly attracts the attention of urban-based and hobby-minded producers who would assure the daily care outside the collect typically through the offices of one villager. There is also a growing tendency towards diversification in the vegetables produced, new breeds in demand by Izmir's customer base and previously unheard of like broccolis, asparagus, soybeans, kiwis, kakis, also making their appearance. The level of mechanisation in agricultural activities is high and well above the national averages.\n\nThere are about 200 large dairies, poultries or livestock breeding farms across the district area, catering İzmir's huge market. The quantity of milk produced in Kemalpaşa in 2007 was 38.065 tonnes. There are 345.000 beehives and 345 tonnes honey and 10 tonnes of beeswax was produced in 2007.\n\nKemalpaşa center has an open market (bazaar) area covering 8.000 square meters, and the depending townships of Ulucak 3.000 and Armutlu 2.000 square meters, where local and rural products are sold. Outside KOSBİ industrial zone, firms established in Kemalpaşa realized exports reaching 260 million US Dollars in 2006, principally products of agriculture such as cherries, peaches, raisins and olive oil.\n\nSocial life \n\nKemalpaşa's proximity to İzmir and the tendency of the population to head for the big city for activities of social life becomes a factor which plays against Kemalpaşa district center in terms of the availability on the spot of social facilities. While the mountain passage at Karabel where the Hittite monument is located has been arranged into a picnic area and the remains of Vatatzes's palace could attract more visitors, the absence of facilities for overnight visitors tend to limit Kemalpaşa's tourism potential to daily visits or excursions by trekking or hunting groups.\n\nOne popular spot at a distance of a few kilometers to Kemalpaşa center is the \"Kazakh Valley\" or \"Kımız Farm\", located near the forests on the slopes of the Mount Nif and arranged around Central Asian themes, complete with a yurt built in concrete, serving Kazakh/Uzbek food and reputed to have one of the best offers of the ancestral drink kımız in Turkey.

{"id": "4105164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie%20Starling", "title": "Ronnie Starling", "text": "Ronald William Starling (11 October 1909 – 17 December 1991) was an English footballer whose career lasted from 1926 to 1946. Starling was an inside forward who made 413 appearances in all competitions, never a high scoring inside forward he was a player who created chances for other players, notching a modest 65 goals throughout his career. His ball carrying ability earned him the nickname of \"The Man with the Fluttering Feet\".\n\nPlaying career\nBorn in Pelaw, County Durham, Ronnie Starling represented Durham County schools as a youth and began working in the coal mines in the north-east at the age of 14, firstly at Usworth colliery and then Washington Colliery. He was spotted by Hull City manager Billy McCracken while playing amateur football for Washington Colliery and signed for the Yorkshire club in October 1926 at the age of 17.\n\nHull City\nStarling initially worked in the club offices whilst playing for the club as an amateur. He was part of the side which reached the FA Cup semi-final in the 1929–30 season, losing to Arsenal after a replay. Despite their good cup form that season the team struggled in Division Two and were heading for relegation when soon after the semi-final he returned to his native North-East with a £3,750 move to Newcastle United in May 1930.\n\nNewcastle United\nStarling was a regular in the Newcastle team in his first season at St James' Park (1930–31) making 38 appearances however the following campaign he only made 15 appearances losing his place in the side before Christmas to new signing Harry McMenemy. He took no part all in Newcastle's FA Cup run which saw the team beat Arsenal 2–1 in the final and on 25 June 1932 he signed for Sheffield Wednesday in a £3,250 deal.\n\nSheffield Wednesday\nStarling was signed by Bob Brown but within a year Billy Walker was in charge. Walker made Starling club captain and played him in a central midfield role prompting him to produce the best football of his career. He played for The Owls for four-and-a-half years, as Wednesday finished third in Division One two seasons running and captained their 1935 FA Cup-winning team. He also played as Wednesday won the 1935 FA Charity Shield. In April 1933, he won his first England cap, playing as inside right in the 2–1 defeat by Scotland. As Wednesday struggled near the bottom of Division One, Starling joined Aston Villa for £6,900 on 6 January 1937, just a day after they had rejected a huge bid for Jackie Robinson from Arsenal. In total he played 176 league matches for Wednesday scoring 31 goals, and appeared in 17 FA Cup matches without scoring.\n\nAston Villa\nStarling was a prominent member of Villa's 1937–38 side which won promotion to Division One. During his time with Villa he made his second England appearance on 17 April 1937, also against Scotland, as inside left in the 3–1 defeat. He remained on the books at Villa Park throughout World War II winning the Football League North in 1944, although he did make guest appearances for Northampton Town, Walsall and Sheffield Wednesday during the conflict. After the war he made single appearances in the League and FA Cup in 1946 before losing his place in the team and finally retiring in 1948, aged 39.\n\nRetirement\nAfter retiring as a player, he spent time as a coach with Nottingham Forest before retiring from football altogether, becoming a newsagent, with a shop on Middlewood Road near to Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground.\n\nSheffield Wednesday won the 1991 Football League Cup Final, Wednesday's first trophy since Ronnie Starling lifted the FA Cup in 1935. Starling was photographed for the Sheffield Star newspaper with the trophy and Wednesday players shortly before his death on 17 December 1991, aged 82.\n\nReferences\n\n1909 births\nEnglish men's footballers\nEngland men's international footballers\nPeople from Pelaw\nFootballers from Tyne and Wear\nHull City A.F.C. players\nNewcastle United F.C. players\nSheffield Wednesday F.C. players\nAston Villa F.C. players\n1991 deaths\nMen's association football forwards"}

On his return, he worked as an estate agent in London.  Shortly thereafter, he was spotted as a business talent by George Farrow who ran a small property company called Peachey. Farrow recruited Miller to work for him, and after Farrow's retirement, Miller became Chairman of Peachey.\n\nProperty dealings\nUnder Miller's guidance, Peachey Property Corporation took over many other companies and became the predominant freeholder for high-end leasehold properties in London. In the early 1960s, a sudden change in policy led Peachey to sell off some of the residential property in an attempt to become a major player in the commercial property field (then undergoing a boom). This attempt was not particularly successful. Miller was the developer of the Churchill Hotel in Portman Square\nfor the Loews US Corporation.\n\nPolitical activity\nMiller's father had been a Labour Party councillor and he also supported the party. In the early 1970s, Eric Miller began contributing to the running of Harold Wilson's private office and became a large financial supporter. He was appointed to the board of Labour Party Properties and served as Treasurer of the Socialist International. He was also a long serving director of Fulham F.C. previously having a stand at the club's Craven Cottage stadium named after him, since renamed as the Riverside Stand.\n\nInvestigations\nMiller received a knighthood in the 1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours list. However, rumours were already growing that the financial dealings of his companies had not been legitimate, and his inclusion in the list was criticised. Investigations uncovered the siphoning off of large sums from the Peachey Property Corporation, and Miller was forced from the chairmanship and eventually off the Peachey board entirely in early 1977. The Fraud Squad and Department of Trade launched investigations, and Miller was served with four writs seeking restitution of funds he had allegedly taken.\n\nPersonal life and death\nMiller was twice married, first to Leonore E. Frankel in 1950. The marriage ended in divorce. He married secondly to Myra Cohen in 1957.\n\nMiller died by suicide in September 1977, shooting himself in the head on the Jewish Day of Atonement.\n\nReferences\n\n1926 births\n1977 deaths\nEnglish fraudsters\nEnglish white-collar criminals\nBritish real estate businesspeople\nEnglish Jews\nKnights Bachelor\nSuicides by firearm in England\nBurials at Willesden Jewish Cemetery\n20th-century English businesspeople\n1977 suicides"}
{"id": "4105180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953%20South%20African%20general%20election", "title": "1953 South African general election", "text": "General elections were held in South Africa on 15 April 1953. The elections consolidated the position of the National Party under D. F. Malan, which won an absolute majority of the 156 elected seats in the House of Assembly, also receiving the most votes. Its first-time majority of the white electorate would be retained until the 1989 elections.\n\nThe United Party under JGN Strauss, who had become leader after Jan Smuts' death in 1950, lost several seats, and suffered several splits after the election. The Labour Party leader died five days before the election. Cape Coloured voters voted for the last time in a general election until 1994, overwhelmingly for the United Party.\n\nChanges in composition\n\nNative representative members\nThe second term of the white MPs elected to represent black voters, from special electoral districts in Cape Province under the Representation of Natives Act 1936, expired on 30 June 1948 (just over a month after the National Party came to power in the 1948 general election). These seats were not vacated by a dissolution of Parliament, so they were not contested at either the 1948 or 1953 general elections.\n\nThe three representative seats were filled by elections on 17 November 1948. Two Independent MPs (W.H. Stuart of Transkeian Territories and Mrs V.M.L. Ballinger of Cape Eastern) were returned. The third seat was taken by Sam Kahn, a South African Communist Party member, who gained the seat from an Independent.\n\nThe term of these members expired on 30 June 1954 (the first 30 June to fall after five years from the date of election).\n\nThe Communist Party dissolved itself (at least as an open political party) when legislation to ban it was going through Parliament in 1950. Sam Kahn was ultimately banned from being a member of Parliament, in 1952, under the anti-Communist legislation. Subsequently, two successive by-elections were held in Cape Western, but the victors had similar views to Mr Kahn and were also excluded from Parliament. The seat was then left vacant for the remainder of the term.\n\nSouth West Africa\nThe white electors of the territory of South West Africa (present day Namibia), were allocated six seats in the House of Assembly. These new electoral divisions were first filled at by-elections on 31 August 1950. The governing National Party won all the seats, which were additional to the 150 general roll seats allocated to the Union of South Africa.\n\nDelimitation of electoral divisions\nThe South Africa Act 1909 had provided for a delimitation commission to define the boundaries for each electoral division. The representation by province, under the tenth delimitation report of 1953, is set out in the table below. The figures in brackets are the number of electoral divisions in the previous (1947) delimitation. If there is no figure in brackets then the number was unchanged.\n\nThe above table does not include the three native representative seats in Cape Province nor the six South-West African divisions, which were not included in the delimitation of the general roll seats for the Union under the South Africa Act 1909.\n\nPosition at the dissolution\nAt the end of the 10th Union Parliament, when it was dissolved in 1953, the House of Assembly consisted of two groups of members. General roll voters (white voters from the whole Union and South-West Africa and coloured electors in Cape Province and Natal) were represented by 156 members. Black voters in Cape Province were represented by three white MPs, known at the time as Native Representative Members (NRM).\n\nThe general election, on 15 April 1953, only affected the representatives of general roll voters. From 1938 the Native Representative Members had fixed terms and were elected on a different date.\nThe overall composition of the House, set out by province before the general election, was as below.\n\nAbbreviations in the province list.\n Orange FS: Orange Free State\n SW Africa: South-West Africa\n NRM: Native Representative Members\n\nNote: The NRM seat, formerly held by the Communist Party, is listed as Independent in the above table. Sam Kahn and his two successors, after the Communist Party dissolved its public organisation and went underground, all claimed to be Independents.\n\nCampaign\nSince the 1948 general election Dr Malan's Reunited National Party had merged with its coalition partner, the Afrikaner Party. The merged party was named the National Party (NP). The government had also strengthened its political position, by conferring six parliamentary seats upon the white population of the territory of South West Africa.\n\nThe principal opposition party was the United Party (UP). Since the previous general election, in 1948, the UPs veteran leader Field Marshal Jan Smuts had died. The new Leader of the Opposition was J.G.N. Strauss.\n\nThe other parliamentary opposition party was the Labour Party. In 1953, the United Party and the Labour Party had an electoral pact, for the third successive general election.\n\nDuring the campaign, the Labour leader John Christie died. His seat was consequently contested at a by election after the normal day of the general election poll. It was retained by a new Labour candidate and is included in the totals for the results section of this article,\n\nThe NP promoted its policy of apartheid Dr Malan suggested that the white voters could unite around the Nationalist programme. The UP criticised the idea of apartheid as impractical and eventually disastrous. Mr Strauss campaigned alleging that the first task of a South African government should be the suppression of \"Native\" crime, who created insecurity in the major cities. United Party supporters were optimistic on the eve of the poll of regaining their position as the largest party.\n\nResults\nDue to the first-past-the-post system, the Nationalists won 37 more seats than United despite finishing only two percentage points ahead of United in the popular vote. As Cape Coloured voters still exercised this right in the Cape province, the majority among white voters would actually have been higher. This was enough to deliver the Nationalists a second consecutive majority government.\n\nBy province\n\nReferences\n\n Keesing's Contemporary Archives\n Smuts: A Reappraisal, by Bernard Friedman (George, Allen & Unwin 1975) \n South Africa 1982 Official Yearbook of the Republic of South Africa, published by Chris van Rensburg Publications\n The South African Constitution, by H.J.

{"id": "4105196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetSys", "title": "NetSys", "text": "NetSys International (Pty) Ltd. is a South African–based company, specialising in solutions  for the weather and aviation industries.\n\nHistory\nThe company was registered in 1981 as a private company (Company registration no: 1981/02825/07).\n\nNetSys was founded for the purpose of developing network communications equipment and automatic message switching systems. The first customer was the South African Defence Force which ordered a logistics network comprising some 50 nodes of proprietary networking devices. The experience gained during this deployment was instrumental in entering into the international market. In 1988, NetSys was awarded a contract by the American computer company, Control Data Corporation, to develop a meteorological message-switching system on the back of the NetSys network devices. This development and subsequent investment in aviation related product development enabled NetSys to become a major solutions supplier in the Meteorological and Aviation industries.\n\nSince the work done for Control Data Corporation, NetSys has won a selection of tenders from a number of prestigious organisations. The main product was Weatherman, a message switch tailored for effective management of weather reports. In 1996 NetSys entered into the new area of Aviation with the commissioning of an automated Met and AIS pilot briefing system in Sweden, under the system name of Met/AIS. Isak Lombard, an executive director of NetSys, also joined NetSys in 1996 to become part of the Met/AIS team. The Met/AIS system became FlightMan that was subsequently acquired by aviation authorities in many other countries.\n\nNetSys International, in a strategic move to ensure that it remained a leader in its chosen fields, sought ISO Accreditation during 1998, achieving this goal on 29 March 1999 when NetSys received its ISO 9001 Accreditation Certificate from DEKRA – ITS Certification Services (Pty) Ltd.\n\nIn another strategic move, NetSys decided in 2001 to supply commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware for its system solutions – Cisco Systems for synchronous connections and Wide Area Network interfaces, 3Com for Local Area Network connections, Digi for asynchronous ports, Hewlett-Packard and Dell for server hardware are given preference when proposing new deals.\n\nIn 2003, NetSys decided to consolidate its applications under one umbrella user-interface to provide a consistent look-and-feel for a diverse set of applications and different types of users. The solution was based on a client-server architecture where much of the existing proven server software (NSSRV) are re-used but exposed in modern client software (NSWS). This new solution is called the NetSys Solutions approach, where necessary elements from the server and client software are chosen and utilised to create a best-fit solution for the customer's needs.\n\nNetSys entered a new development direction in 2004 with the creation of its NOTAM management software. This system is currently in operation in Taiwan.\n\nOrigin of the name\nNetSys was founded as Network Systems. The name was changed in 1988 to a shorter form, Netsys International, and finally in 2004 by the managing director of the time, to NetSys International.\nIn 1993, Netsys UK was registered to act as the NetSys UK representative.\n\nMeteorological communication centres/Regional telecommunication hubs\nNetSys has a number of users that falls into this category. These users are typically responsible for the ingestion and dissemination of weather data. They provide a service to their clients by selectively distributing data based on routing tables. The routing tables are based on the WMO headers, or it may be AFTN send groups and addresses. Such a communication centre normally has a number of data sources and destinations which may support a variety of protocols. The product that is traditionally used is WeatherMan. More recent users use the NSSRV MHS with the modern NSWS Control Centre.\n\nThe NetSys software fulfills the needs of a Regional Telecommunications Hub (RTH), as specified by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). In this category NetSys has its message switching software in South Africa (Pretoria), India (Delhi), Hungary (Budapest), Switzerland (Zurich) and Poland (Warsaw).\n\nAnother sub-category of these users are those responsible for message communication but more under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO). These users are typically connected to the AFTN for the reception and transmission of MET data. The CoreMet system of UK NATS at the Heathrow communication centre is an example of such a site. This system is also responsible for the data quality and the uplink of all OPMET data disseminated over the SADIS satellite broadcast. In this regard, WeatherMan is used extensively to automatically correct systematic errors and rejected messages are sent to the NSWS Control Centre for manual correction with the aid of system provided diagnostics and hints.\n\nAnother category of software that is used by NATS for example is the NSWS Met Data Monitor. It is used to monitor the timely arrival of data from different locations. Late arrivals are displayed on a dynamic map and with this functionality NATS can very quickly identify regional communication breakdowns around the globe. It also broadcasts reports of late arrivals as administrative messages to SADIS users, thus applying some peer pressure for performance improvement.\n\nData banks\nIt might be required by international organisations that some countries provide international and local data banks of OPMET or NOTAM. Examples of which are the European OPMET databanks in Brussels and Vienna, and EAD at Eurocontrol. The NetSys systems at BelgoControl are responsible for providing the Brussels databank.\n\nFlight information services/Flight planning centres\nCertain civil aviation authorities put a high value on quality and personalised pre-flight briefing. They require a system that will automatically deliver pre-flight bulletins where it is needed: e-mailed, faxed or delivered on paper. Each bulletin is tailor made from the flight route, derived from the flight plan. A typical requirement is to provide the most essential information possible, not to overload the cockpit with unnecessary paper and irrelevant data. For this purpose, these types of users normally require a narrow route briefing, where only information that touches or overlaps a flight corridor is included. An example of an excellent flight briefing service is the FPC at Arlanda in Sweden. A perfect product for such a customer is NSWS Flight Briefing with the necessary NSSRV components added as required, e.g. fax drivers. Legal records of all delivered flight briefings are also kept to provide an exact history. This may be crucial during an accident investigation.\n\nLarge airports\nMany airports require a larger and integrated system. Normally this involves connecting a number of fringe systems and centralising data collection and distribution, the display of CCTV screens at control towers, processing of runway instrumentation output (e.g. RVR and wind) and much more. Here NetSys has the ability to use its NSSRV MHS to centralise the collection of data and distribute it in a controlled manner to all client systems. It allows a centralised archiving function that becomes crucial during accident investigations. NetSys can also integrate many data formats and massage them to fit the client's needs. An example is the special message format requirements for ATIS or VOLMET systems as implement in Belgium and India for example. NetSys developed one of the first interfaces to an AMHS to exchange meteorological data using the X.400 protocol.\n\nRemote airports\nThere are many airports that do not have their own forecasters or a proper infrastructure to link them with forecasting centres but that need to supply pilots with weather briefings. This is a potential larger market but with relatively low margin and project costs. NSWS WAFS together with a satellite receiver for SADIS or ISCS is used in this scenarios. NetSys has many such small sites, many of which have been sponsored by IATA or managed by ICAO. Examples of current sites include Saudi Arabia, Oman, Ecuador, Mongolia, Afghanistan and China. NSWS WAFS displays the WAFS data and allows the user to produce Meteorological briefings.\n\nAviation forecasting\nSome civil aviation authorities have a meteorological department that provide local weather forecasting. An example is BelgoControl in Belgium, where the organisation has a number of forecasters that produce local forecasts specifically for aviation customers such as airlines, freight operators and private pilots. NetSys also maintains a climate database for BelgoControl in which SYNOP, METAR and TAF messages for selected stations are decoded up to element level and stored for research and quality control purposes. TAMC in Taiwan is another example of a user that produces its own SIGWX charts with NSWS Forecaster.\n\nFlight information centres/NOTAM Offices\nThere are many NOTAM offices in the world that still use a paper system to manage the NOTAM. The lack of computerisation is because of the wide deviation from NOTAM standards, as well as the high importance of this data. Contrary to Met data, NOTAM data volumes are low but each is of high importance. Carefully assigned sequence numbers guard the integrity of the data base. This market is potentially huge but faces its own challenges. Integration with an AIP is essential should one want to fully utilise FPL routes. NetSys can offer our NSWS NOTAM product specifically for NOTAM offices and our NSWS Flight Briefing for customers that require extended flight briefing.\n\nMajor customer installations\nIncluding the major sites listed below, NetSys provides customer support in over 17 countries around the world.\n\n SMI in Zurich, Switzerland\n LFV in Stockholm, Sweden\n NATS at Heathrow in London, United Kingdom\n IMD in Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai, India\n Belgocontrol in Brussels, Belgium\n IM at Lisbon and Islands, Portugal\n ANWS in Taipei, Taiwan\n SAWS in Pretoria, South Africa\n ATMB in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, China\n\nEnvironment of South Africa\nInformation technology companies of South Africa\nCompanies based in the City of Tshwane\nOrganisations based in Pretoria"}

Within two years, there were fifty Earth First groups and activists linked with other parties in the road protest movement. There were large camps at Twyford Down and the M11 link road protest. By 1997, the Government had decided to reduce its road-building plans by two thirds.\n\nAfter this success, the environmental movement then took on local struggles such as fighting a quarry at Stanton Moor and opposing a new runway at Manchester Airport. It grew to include different groups such as Camps for Climate Action, Plane Stupid, Reclaim the Streets, Rising Tide and The Land is Ours. In the 2010s, new groups emerged such as Extinction Rebellion, and Grow Heathrow camps protesting against HS2. In the early 2020s there were series of actions by Insulate Britain, Tyre Extinguishers and Just Stop Oil.\n\nEarth First! \n\nThe Earth First (EF) movement in the United Kingdom started in 1991 with a protest at Dungeness nuclear power station in Kent. From its inception, Earth First was committed to direct action techniques from the group's inception, with support for only nonviolent ecotage.\n\nEarth First consisted of a loose collection of groups and activists with no central organisation. After two years, there were fifty such groups, protesting in numbers not seen since the 1980s peace movement. The initial Earth First action focused around the importation of tropical hardwoods, with a protest at Liverpool docks in 1992. This action coincided with the Earth First roadshow, in which a group of activists toured the country.\n\nMost actions were organised by individual groups and attended by people from other groups in the movement, some of them wore distinctive colours. Co-ordination happened through various publications including Do or Die, the Earth First! Action Update and later SchNEWS. Activist met at regular Earth First gatherings.\n\nRoad protest camps \n\nEarth First groups, together with many other groups, then became involved in the road protest movement, as an attempt to reverse the Government's road-building programme. The first major road protest happened at Twyford Down where a permanent protest camp was set up in late 1992 to oppose the construction of a new section of the M3 motorway. The Dongas tribe arose from this camp.\n\nThe first tree-sits (occupations of trees) happened at Jesmond Dene in Newcastle in 1993, organised by the Flowerpot Tribe.\n\nOther early protests included Pollok Country Park in Glasgow,  River Roddlesworth and Stanworth Valley near Preston, and at Solsbury Hill near Bath and the M11 link road protest in London, where an entire street was squatted. After the eviction of Claremont Road in 1994, protesters from the Flowerpot and Dongas tribes joined the protest at Stanworth valley to build an \"Ewok village\" of the tree houses.\n\nThere were many subsequent road protests including Newbury bypass, the A30, Swampy became well known during the eviction at the A30 camp, although there were many other smaller road protest camps. Some camps did actually result in roads being cancelled, the first such cancellation occurring in London.\n\nBy 1997, the Government had shrunk the road-building programme to a third of its original size. Alongside the need to save money and several reports criticising the original plans, the environmental direct action movement could claim a large role in this reduction. Another sign of its effectiveness had already been seen in 1994, when  the Government had passed the Criminal Justice Act. Among other things it created a series of new offences which criminalised many forms of protest.\n\nWider Earth First actions \nThe focus of Earth First broadened over time to include protesting against the Manchester Airport second runway and fighting the use of genetically modified organisms. At the Nine Ladies stone circle in the Peak District, a camp successfully helped prevent a new quarry.\n\nThe movement can be said to have given rise to a number of other groups, notably Reclaim the Streets and Rising Tide. The Land is Ours set up the Pure Genius camp on  of derelict land which had previously housed a brewery owned by Guinness company. The squatters, including George Monbiot, stated they had occupied the land fifty years after the successes of the post World War II squatting movement.\n\nClimate activism \n \nDirect action techniques have also been applied to climate-related issues. On 31 August 2006, 600 people attended a protest called Reclaim Power against carbon emissions at the coal-fired Drax power station in Yorkshire. The protests were coordinated by the Camp for Climate Action, a ten-day camp held near the power station. The campers had also blockaded a nuclear power station in Hartlepool, Teesside.\n\nAt a later climate camp, undercover police officer Mark Kennedy encouraged activists to commit aggravated trespass at Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station and the trial of six people subsequently collapsed when this was revealed.\n\nActions carried out by the Plane Stupid group include the grounding of planes through the establishment of a climate camp on an airport taxiway and occupations of offices belonging to airport operator BAA and short-haul airline, EasyJet. On 8 December 2008, the group breached the perimeter of London Stansted Airport, causing a runway to be closed for three hours and the cancellation of 56 Ryanair flights. The protest was in response to the announcement that a second runway would be built at Stansted and there were 57 arrests.\n\nGrow Heathrow is a land squat in Sipson, west London, on a site which might be demolished to build a new runway at Heathrow Airport. It was occupied in 2010 and partially evicted in 2019.  Frack Off was set up in 2011, one of a number of groups set up in response to concerns about the safety of fracking and other forms of shale gas extraction. Following on from these groups, Extinction Rebellion was set up on 31 October 2018, after a letter was published in The Guardian voicing concerns about the ecological crisis which was signed by 94 scientists.\n\nA series of protests by the group Insulate Britain involving traffic obstruction began on 13 September 2021. The group Tyre Extinguishers deflated the tyres of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in cities around the UK in March and April 2022. The Just Stop Oil coalition of climate activism groups disrupted oil terminals across England for 12 days in April 2022. Throughout 2022 and 2023, Just Stop Oil have continued to protest, disrupting events and slow marching.\n\nHigh Speed 2 \nHigh Speed 2 is a currently under construction high-speed railway network which will link London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester. According to the Woodland Trust, 108 sites of ancient woodland are under threat. The decision of the Department for Transport was that phase one, construction of a rail link from London to Birmingham, could begin on 15 April 2020. Four woodlands in Warwickshire were immediately destroyed, despite the recommended advice being to only carry out felling in autumn to minimise damage to flora and fauna. Environmental campaigners had already set up occupations along the route of the proposed train line. In January 2020, HS2 Limited began evicting a series of camps in the Colne Valley Regional Park which had been occupied since October 2017. Activists, including some connected to Extinction Rebellion and the Green Party had been monitoring the work on HS2 and contested the evictions, claiming that HS2 did not own the land. In May 2020, a squat in Harefield, west London was evicted.\n\nSee also \n 38 Degrees\n Civil disobedience\n Civil resistance\n Climate Rush\n Environmentalism\n Frack Off\n Friends of the Earth (EWNI)\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\nPeter Styles (2012) Birds, Booze & Bulldozers\n\nExternal links \n Earth First!

The result was a victory for the National Party, now under the leadership of J.G. Strijdom after the retirement of Daniel Malan in 1954. The opposition United Party campaigned for the first time under De Villiers Graaff, who would remain party leader for two decades. \n\nThe National Party won 103 seats in the House of Assembly. It was the first election in South Africa with a whites-only electorate, following the removal of the Cape Qualified Franchise in the late 1950s, after the resolution of the coloured vote constitutional crisis. Coloured voters were now represented by four white MPs elected in separate constituencies, after the model introduced for native (black) voters in 1936.\n\nChanges in composition and franchise\n\nNative Representative Members\nThe third term of the (white) MPs elected to represent black voters, from special electoral districts in Cape Province under the Representation of Natives Act 1936, expired on 30 June 1954. These seats were not vacated by a dissolution of Parliament, so they were not contested at the 1953 general election.\n\nThe three representative seats were filled by elections on 1 December 1954. Two Liberal Party of South Africa MPs (A.W.P. Stanford of Transkei and Mrs V.M.L. Ballinger of Cape Eastern) were returned. Stanford took his seat from an Independent. Ballinger had been elected as an Independent at the three previous representative elections, before becoming the first President of the Liberal Party, when it was formed on 9 May 1953. The third seat was taken by L.B. Lee-Warden, an Independent candidate.\n\nThe term of these members expired on 30 June 1960 (the first 30 June to fall after five years from the date of election). The Native Representative Members seats were to be abolished in 1960, at the end of the current term.\n\nColoured Representative Members\nThe Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951, had provided for coloured voters in Cape Province to be removed from the general voters rolls and placed on a separate roll. The coloured voters lost the right to participate in general roll elections and were given four (white) representative members in Parliament.\n\nThe implementation of the 1951 Act was delayed in what is known as the Coloured vote constitutional crisis, due to legal arguments about whether Parliament had complied with the requirement for a two-thirds majority in joint session, before it could remove the coloured voters from the general roll.\n\nEventually legislation to change the size and electoral system for the Senate was enacted, which the courts accepted as enabling the 1951 Act to be validated by the constitutionally required margin.\n\nThe Coloured Representative Members were elected, for the first time, on 3 April 1958, for a term expiring with the next dissolution of Parliament. Four supporters of the United Party were elected to fill the new seats.\n\nDelimitation of electoral divisions\nThe South Africa Act 1909 had provided for a delimitation commission to define the boundaries for each electoral division, for general roll voters in the four provinces. The representation by province, under the eleventh delimitation report of 1958, is set out in the table below. The figures in brackets are the number of electoral divisions in the previous (1953) delimitation. If there is no figure in brackets then the number was unchanged.\n\nComposition at the dissolution\nAt the end of the 11th Union Parliament, when it was dissolved in 1958, the House of Assembly consisted of two types of members. White voters were represented by 156 members and black voters in Cape Province by three white MPs (known at the time as Native Representative Members). A third type of MP was about to be elected, so that four white MPs would represent coloured voters in Cape Province. They were known as the Coloured Representative Members (CRM).\n\nThe general election, on 16 April 1958, only affected the representatives of white voters. The other members were elected on different dates (see above).\n\nThe representation by party and province, at the dissolution was:-\n\nAbbreviations in the province list.\n Orange FS: Orange Free State\n SW Africa: South-West Africa\n NRM: Native Representative Members\n\nResults\nThe general election, for 156 seats in the 12th Union Parliament, was the first in South African history when only voters classified as white took part. In the eleven previous general elections, the Cape Province and Natal general electoral roll had included some black (until 1938 in the Cape), Asian (until 1948) and coloured electors.\n\nThe election saw the collapse of the South African Labour Party which lost all 5 of its seats and whose vote dropped from almost 35,000 votes in 1953 to 2,670 votes in 1958. The drop in support is largely attributed to the party leader Alex Hepple's growing outspokenness in opposition to apartheid and his co-operation with the African National Congress, positions which were not supported at the time by white workers who were the bulk of the Labour Party's electorate. Moreover, the party did not repeat its electoral alliance with the United Party, and its sole two candidates in the election - Hepple and Leo Lovell - both finished in distant third places, losing their seats to United Party candidates.\n\nA total of 24 seats were uncontested, all of which were won by the United Party.\n\nBy province\nThe overall composition of the House, after the general election, was as below. There were boundary changes, from the delimitation of seats in the previous Parliament, so no attempt is made to identify changes.\n\nReferences\n General Elections in South Africa, 1943-70, by Kenneth A.

{"id": "4105205", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekachakra", "title": "Ekachakra", "text": "Ekachakra is a small village, located 20 km away from the town of Rampurhat in the Birbhum District of West Bengal. Within Hindu tradition, the five Pandavas from the epic, Mahabharata are described as staying in Ekachakra during their years in exile.  It is also famous as the birthplace of Nityananda Rama (b 1474 CE), a principal religious figure in the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition.\n\nThe village extends north and south for an area of about eight miles. Other villages, namely Viracandra-pura and Virabhadra-pura, are situated within the area of the village of Ekacakra. In honor of Virachandra Goswami (the son of Nityananda), these places are renowned as Viracandra-pura and Virabhadra-pura.\n\nToponym\nThe origin of the name Ekachakra is associated with the legend of the Pandavas. In the battle of Kurukshetra Krishna broke his vow of not actively participating in the war as a warrior and rushed with chariot wheel chakram to help his devotee Arjuna, and slay Bhishma who had been fighting with Arjuna but not losing. When Bhishma satisfied him with many beautiful prayers, Krishna lost his anger and tossed aside the chariot wheel chakram. The chakram fell on this tract of land and therefore got the name Ekachakra. Eka means one, and chakra means chakram.\n\nIn the Mahabharata, it is also believed to be the place where Demon Bakasura lived who was later slain by Bhima. However, there are several places all over India which contest as ancient Ekachakra.\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\nEkachakra is located at .\n\nGarbhavasa\nThis is said to be the actual birthplace of Nityananda. In the Janmasthan Mandir there is a deity of Nitai (Nityananda) worshipped by a local brahmin family. Hadai Pandita Bhavan is the site of the original house of Nityananda's father. The small white temple next to Nitai Kund marks the exact spot where Nityananda was born. There are two banyan trees by this temple that are said to have existed since the time of Nityananda.\n\nIn the center of the main altar of the temple is a deity of Lord Nityananda. To his left, with his hands raised, is Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. On Nityananda's right is Advaita Acharya. The side altar has deities of Radha-Radhakanta and Radha-Srikanta, a large dancing Gouranga in the center, and ten brass sakhis at the bottom. The temple was constructed by Prasannakumara Karapharma.\n\nMala Tala\nThere is an old Pippala tree here called 'Mala Tala'. Just before Nityananda departed the village in his youth, Hadai Pandita came here and chanted japa under this tree. Mala means \"japa beads\" and tala means \"tree.\" When Nitai was about to depart Hadai Pandita left his japa beads here due to anxiety.\n\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu came to Ekacakra many years after Nityananda left. It is said that at that time Chaitanya left his flower garland on a branch of this tree. Mala also means \"garland.\" Therefore, also for this reason this tree was called Mala Tala.\n\nHantugada Tirtha\n(Also known as Jahnu Kund) It is said that Nitai brought all the sacred waters from all the holy places to this kunda to save the local residents from having to journey to the Ganges to take a sacred bath. It is named Hantugada because Nityananda Prabhu used to perform the Dadhi-cida festival of distributing chipped rice with yogurt prasadam here and He would take the prasada while kneeling down.\n\nPandava Tala\nThis place is a five-minute walk (400m) into the fields, southeast of Nityananda's birthplace. It is surrounded by a group of Keli-kadamba trees. The Pandavas are said to have lived here with their mother, Kunti, when they were exiled to the forest.\n\nBankima Raya Mandira\nThe current deity within the Bankima Raya temple was found by Nityananda himself, within the Yamuna river of Ekachakra.\nThe deity was then installed in a temple that is now submerged within Jahnu kunda.\nNityananda is believed to have merged within this deity at the time of his disappearance.\nThe present temple of Bankima Raya is also an old one.\nThe deity of Jahnava Mata (Nityananda's wife) was placed beside him.\nIn this temple there is also a small samadhi of Virachandra Goswami.\n\nSee also\nVrindavan\nMayapur\nNityananda\nSankirtan\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Ekchakradham, Birth place of Nityananda Prabhu\n A Three Day Pilgrimage to Ekachakra\n Nityananda Janmasthan\n A young girl's account of Ekachakra\n\nHindu temples in West Bengal\nVaishnavism\nSacred groves of India\nVillages in Birbhum district"}

Parliament was dissolved on 2 March and the deadline for the submission of candidates was 13 March. \n\nThe elections marked the first time since the formation of South African in 1910 that the House of Assembly would be responsible solely to White South Africans, as the seats for the four MPs elected separately by \"qualified\" Cape Coloured voters expired in the same year, completing the process of political apartheid. They were also the first elections after the 1969 expulsion of Albert Hertzog and many verkrampte (hardline) representatives from the ruling National Party (NP), who had subsequently formed the Herstigte Nasionale Party (HNP). This realignment marked a new chapter in the political divisions of the country, with the hardline Afrikaner right-wing later forming the Conservative Party in the early 1980s. \n\nThe elections resulted in the NP retained its large majority, reaffirming it as the dominant party for the post-Verwoerd era. Several new representatives were elected, including Chris Heunis, future Acting President and candidate for the NP leadership, and Pik Botha, future Minister of Foreign Affairs (1977–1994). However, the NP lost seats for the first time since the 1948 election, seeing its representation reduced by eight seats. With Hertzog's HNP failing to win a seat, the split in the nationalist vote benefitted the moderate United Party (UP) in several constituencies, invigorating it for perhaps the last time. Helen Suzman, member for Houghton, retained her seat in Johannesburg as the sole representative of the liberal Progressive Party, the last parliament for which she would sit for her caucus alone. Colin Eglin, who became leader of the Progressive Party in 1971, was defeated in the Cape Town seat of Sea Point by only 231 votes.\n\nResults\nEleven members were elected unopposed. Voting in one constituency did not take place, with the National Party winning the subsequent by-election to give it a total of 118 seats.\n\nAftermath\nPik Botha made his maiden speech in an unusual tone for an NP deputy, demanding that the government sign the UN Declaration of Human Rights. F. W. de Klerk was eventually elected to this parliament in a by-election to the seat for Vereeniging in September 1972, replacing NP member V P Coetzee.\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral elections in South Africa\nSouth Africa\nGeneral\nEvents associated with apartheid\nApril 1970 events in Africa"}

The main opposition United Party slightly increased its share of the popular vote, but nevertheless saw its parliamentary representation considerably reduced.\n\nThe number of House of Assembly seats for White voters in South Africa had been increased from 150 to 160 by the Constitution Amendment Act of 1965. In addition, there were six seats for White voters from South-West Africa (now Namibia). There were also four seats reserved for Coloured representatives, who did not have to stand for re-election during 1966.\n\nOn 6 September, several months after the election, Prime Minister Verwoerd was assassinated.\n\nColoured Representative Members\nThe second election for the four coloured representative members had taken place on 4 October 1961, before the (white voters only) general election on 8 October 1961. Under the Separate Representation of Voters Act 1951, the members had been elected to serve until the dissolution of the 1961–1966 Parliament.\n\nThe Progressive Party (PP) won the two seats representing coloured voters on the Cape Provincial Council, at an election in 1965. The National Party (NP) government became concerned at the prospect of four additional Progressive MPs being elected. The opposition United Party (UP) also feared the loss of support, if the existing four UP supported independent members were defeated.\n\nParliament passed the Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act 1965. This legislation extended the term of the existing coloured representatives until October 1966. Further Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Acts, in 1966 and 1968, extended the term until the dissolution of what turned out to be the 1966–1970 Parliament. The coloured representation in Parliament would then be abolished.\n\nDelimitation of electoral divisions\nThe South Africa Act 1909 had provided for a delimitation commission to define the boundaries for each electoral division, for general roll voters in the four provinces. The republican constitution continued the arrangements for a commission. The representation by province, under the twelfth delimitation report of 1965, is set out in the table below. The figures in brackets are the number of electoral divisions in the previous (1958) delimitation. If there is no figure in brackets then the number was unchanged.\n\nSouth-West Africa (with six seats) and the coloured representatives (4 seats), were unaffected by the general delimitation provisions.\n\nComposition at the dissolution\nThe 13th Parliament since the Union of 1910 and the 1st elected after the republic was proclaimed in 1961, was dissolved in 1966. At the time the House of Assembly consisted of two groups of members. White voters were represented by 156 general roll members and coloured voters in Cape Province by four white MPs known at the time as Coloured Representative Members (CRM).\n\nThe general election only affected the representatives of white voters. The other members were elected on a different date (see above).\n\nSince the previous election, the United Party had absorbed the National Union, with which it had had an electoral alliance in 1961.\n\nThe representation by party and province, at the dissolution was:-\n\nResults\nA total of 356 candidates were nominated; 154 for the National Party, 141 for the United Party, 26 for the Progressive Party, 22 for the Republican Party, 10 for the Front Party, two independents and one Christian National Party. The Republican, Front and Conservative National groups were new right-wing parties, which had not contested previous general elections.\n\nEighteen candidates were returned unopposed, seventeen representing the National Party and one the United Party. The Progressive Party barely kept its Houghton seat, held by Helen Suzman since her defection from the UP, winning by 117 votes.\n\nBy province\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral elections in South Africa\nSouth Africa\nGeneral\nEvents associated with apartheid\nMarch 1966 events in Africa"}

The collapse caused the deaths of 32 people and injured 1,634 people. It was blamed on overcrowding and the jetty being made out of steel bars that led to the collapse.\n\nTransport Minister Ling Liong Sik pledged a full and open inquiry to determine its causes, with Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu promising to help the victims through a welfare fund.\n\nCause\n\nTwo simultaneous festivities\nThe cause was extreme crowding at the Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal of about 10,000 people. There were two simultaneous festivities involving the Chinese ethnic group, namely the Kwan Yin Goddess festival in George Town and the St. Anne's Church anniversary in Bukit Mertajam, Penang. The decorated float procession was held at the Esplanade and at Padang Kota [field between Dato Keramat Road and Anson Road] as well as passing through main streets of Georgetown. Statues of this goddess were paraded along streets decorated with colourful lights in the middle of the city on Sunday 31 July 1988 night. There was a call for Buddhist devotees from the Chinese ethnic group to attend the event because it was held only once every 60 years according to the Chinese calendar (a once-in-a-lifetime occasion) and this festivity was believed to bring prosperity because Kwan Yin means 'Goddess of Generosity'. Tourists from Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan also came at that time.\n\nSt. Anne's Church in Bukit Mertajam was also holding a large festival for its anniversary. Many Christian ethnic Chinese worshipped at this church on Sunday morning and proceeded to Penang in the afternoon to visit and observe the Buddhist ceremony.\n\nPacked bridge\nPenang Bridge which opened on 14 September 1985 did not accommodate public transport. Many people chose to go to the island to enjoy the scenic Malacca Strait and sunset, and continue to the Esplanade on foot.\n\nPacked jetty\nThe Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal had two levels. The lower level was for cars and other small vehicles to roll-on/roll-off. The upper level was for passengers from and to the Butterworth bus station. The terminal, built in 1956 could not withstand the 'assault' of 10,000 passengers. Its columns were made of reinforced concrete and floor of thick boards. The floor beams, fencing and walls, made of dense steel, covered the passageway for vehicles beneath.  At 4:40 p.m., the beams buckled and snapped. The floor boards consequently collapsed. The steel walls and roof caved in. The passengers above slid and were crushed by columns and platform boards. Vehicles beneath were smashed.\n\nVictims\n32 people were killed and 1,674 people were injured. Victims were taken to Butterworth Hospital, Bukit Mertajam Hospital and other hospitals. The fire brigade struggled to extricate victims. The left passage was completely stopped. But the right passage could still operate, letting passengers travel to the island and back. The wreckage was left for a while for investigation and expansion planning.\n\nThis news of the ferry terminal collapse was reported on the 8:00 p.m. TV3 main news.\n\nEffects\n\nAfter the incident, the Penang Port Commission studied the suitability and efficiency of the use of ferries between Butterworth and Raja Tun Uda Ferry Terminal at the Penang side. Express bus passengers were dropped not only at the Butterwoth bus station but also at Sungai Dua and Gelugor. Given the relative speeds of crossing the strait by ferry versus the Penang Bridge, most regular commuters now prefer the bridge.\n\nThe Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal was rebuilt with several modifications.\n\nIn popular culture\nOn 11 April 2015, TV3 (Malaysia)'s documentary programme - \"Detik Tragik\" (Tragic Moments) produced an episode about the ferry terminal bridge collapse. This is followed by Fail Bomba of Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) in 2017.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Rozlan Ishak, Alias Aziz, Norlen Mohamed (2004).

{"id": "4105254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20Moore%20Smythe", "title": "James Moore Smythe", "text": "James Moore Smythe (; 1702 – 18 October 1734) was an English playwright and fop.\n\nBiography\n\nSmythe was appointed by the King to the Office of, Co-Paymaster of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms. He was born James Moore. He was the son of Arthur Moore ( – 4 May 1730), MP for Great Grimsby, and his 2nd wife Theophila Smythe, dau. of William Smythe Esq., Paymaster of the Band of Pensioners, now known as The Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms, and Lady Elizabeth Berkeley.  His mother's maternal grandfather was George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley and his mother carried the last name Smythe.  Moore graduated from All Souls College, Oxford with a Bachelor of Arts in 1722.  During his college years, he had a reputation for wittiness and a great attention to fashion.  He was referred to by the informal name \"Jemmy.\"  When his grandfather (William Smythe) died in 1720, he left estates to Moore on condition that he change his name to Smythe, which he did by private Act of Parliament (2 Geo. 2. c. 26).\n\nMoore Smythe was profligate, and even with inherited estates ran up substantial debts.  Furthermore, he had offended several persons in society, and particularly tories.  In 1727, he wrote his only play, The Rival Modes, and the Drury Lane company under the direction of Colley Cibber and Robert Wilks acted it.  Smythe packed the audience in hopes of raising money, but the play was not well received.  The opening night audience included many to whom Smythe owed money.  The play ran for six nights, which was a mediocre run.  However, Smythe received £300 for the author's benefit night.\n\nSmythe's place in Alexander Pope's The Dunciad comes primarily from this play.  In the second act, Smythe quoted eight lines of Pope's poetry.  It appears that Pope had given and then revoked permission for the use of the lines, but Smythe went ahead anyway.  This earned him Pope's wrath, and he was already despised by the other Tory wits.  In The Dunciad of 1727, Pope presents Moore as a \"phantom poet\" whom all the book sellers are desperate to court.  This is partially because of the piracy (Moore does not indicate his source or credit Pope), but it is more because Bernard Lintot offered Moore Smythe the incredible sum of £130 for the publication rights to the play.  (In contrast, Leonard Welsted had had a much greater theatrical success in 1726 with The Dissembled Woman and had received only £30 for the publication rights.) Lintot probably suspected that the controversy would mean sales and that Moore was a new Whig hero.  On the last score, at least, he would have been correct.\n\nEdward Cooke, in his Battel of the Poets of 1729, proclaimed Moore a \"new Dryden.\"  Other \"dunces\" from The Dunciad began to support and collaborate with Moore, and Leonard Welsted joined with Moore in writing One Letter to Mr Pope in 1730.  Moore, despite having no poetic career before the play and virtually no career after it, was being lauded, and this despite what Edward Young called \"a very bad\" play.  Moore Smythe appeared to be a nobleman, a man of fashion, and an anti-Tory, and in The Dunciad he is presented as a great, vacuous nothing whose jingling coat and supposedly jingling pockets induce the mercenary book sellers into a frenzy.  When they reach Moore, they find that he has nothing of his own, including his clothes.\n\nIn 1730, Pope renewed this characterisation of Moore Smythe.  In The Grub-Street Journal for May and June, Pope wrote:\nA Gold watch found on a Cinder Whore,\nOr a good verse on J--my M-re,\nProves but what either shou'd conceal,\nNot that they're rich, but that they steal.\nIn each attack, Pope characterises Moore primarily as a plagiarist.  When the book sellers reach their \"Phantom Moore\" in The Dunciad, all the poetry in his collection flies back to the poets it was stolen from.  Pope indicates that Moore stole not only from him, but from Dryden, from John Arbuthnot, and from others.  In the context of The Dunciad, Moore stands not just for the generally degraded fop, nor for the imprudent heir of a fortune, but for the avarice and stupidity of book sellers (exemplified by Edmund Curll) who would publish anything at all, regardless of value, if it looked like it would sell.  Thus, Moore Smythe's calculated gesture of using his notoriety to sell seats in the playhouse and the book sellers who would count upon that notoriety to sell copies of the play were mirrored sides of a critique of an emergent mass market for literature, and Pope's primary target is the abandonment of standards of quality.\n\nAfter his quarrel with Pope, Moore Smythe continued in his debts and insolvency.  He died unmarried and in poverty on 18 October 1734.  The next year, in Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot, Pope again attacked Moore Smythe as a plagiarist.  Since his day, Moore Smythe has been remembered almost exclusively as Pope presented him, as a noble-born dunce.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Carter, Philip.  \"James Moore Smythe\".

{"id": "4105258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWME-CD", "title": "WWME-CD", "text": "WWME-CD (channel 23) is a low-power, Class A television station in Chicago, Illinois, United States, which serves as the flagship station of multicast networks MeTV and Heroes & Icons. It is owned by locally based Weigel Broadcasting alongside fellow Weigel flagship properties, CW affiliate WCIU-TV (channel 26) and independent station WMEU-CD (channel 48). The stations share studios on Halsted Street (between Washington Boulevard and Madison Street) in the Greektown neighborhood, while WWME-CD's transmitter is located atop the Willis Tower on South Wacker Drive in the Chicago Loop.\n\nEven though WWME-CD has a digital signal of its own, the low-power broadcasting radius does not reach the outer ring of Chicago proper or surrounding suburbs. Therefore, the station can also be seen through a 16:9 widescreen standard definition simulcast on WCIU's third digital subchannel, with Heroes & Icons being carried on WCIU-DT4 in order to reach the entire market. This signal is broadcast on channel 26.3 from the same Willis Tower transmitter site.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\nThe station first signed on the air on October 28, 1987 as W23AT, originally operating as a translator of WFBT. In 2001, the station changed its callsign to WFBT-CA and shifted to a brokered-time ethnic programming format (coincidentally, this was the original programming format of sister station WCIU-TV from 1964 until it converted into an English-language, entertainment-based independent station on December 31, 1994).\n\nLaunch of MeTV as a programming format\nOn January 6, 2003, WFBT debuted a programming block called \"Me-TV\", which featured classic television series from the 1950s to the 1980s (such as The Jack Benny Program, Sergeant Bilko, The Carol Burnett Show, Maude and One Day at a Time) daily from 12:00 to 3:00 p.m. \"Me-TV\" underwent several lineup changes throughout its existence as a block, adding and removing shows and expanding the time periods during which it broadcast (eventually running from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. by 2004).\n\nOn December 31, 2005, Weigel rechristened channel 23 as WWME-CA, with MeTV becoming the station's full-time programming format and on-air branding. The station's former ethnic programming and WFBT call letters moved to W48DD (channel 48). On August 4, 2007, WWME introduced \"Sí! Me-TV\" (the first two parts of the moniker were based on the phrase \"see me\", although \"Sí\" is the Spanish word for \"yes\"), a weekend morning block which featured Spanish-dubbed versions of classic shows from the Universal Television library (such as Hercules, Xena, Miami Vice, Quantum Leap and The Incredible Hulk). Some programs that aired during the block were available to the station only in Spanish, due to syndicated restrictions imposed on the original English-language versions; \"Sí! Me-TV\" also offered a public affairs program targeted at Chicago's Latino population, which began at a later date. The block was discontinued on January 25, 2009.\n\nOn March 1, 2008, channel 48 – which adopted the WMEU-CA call letters at that time – was converted into an extension of WWME's MeTV format as MeToo. Initially, the two stations maintained similar programming schedules; however by that fall, one station focused mainly on sitcoms while the other largely focused on dramas, and vice versa. In addition to classic television series, WWME also broadcast sporting events from the Chicago Public Schools Public League.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, WWME's MeTV schedule shifted its programming to a sitcom-intensive format (running such shows as The Bernie Mac Show, All in the Family, The Three Stooges and Frasier), while the MeToo schedule on WMEU-CA was restructured to feature only off-network dramatic programs (such as Perry Mason, Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Twilight Zone) and films to streamline the schedules of both MeTV outlets.\n\nConversion into the flagship station of the MeTV network\nOn November 22, 2010, Weigel Broadcasting announced that it would turn the MeTV concept into a national network that would compete along with similar classic television multicast networks such as the Retro Television Network and (the then yet-launched) Antenna TV, while complementing its successful sister network This TV. The MeTV network launched on December 15, 2010, with WWME serving as its flagship station, and by effect, effectively became an owned-and-operated station of the national network. Concurrently, WMEU reincorporated comedy series into its schedule, resulting in both stations once again maintaining identical formats – albeit with other programming as the national MeTV network focuses on series from the 1950s to the 1970s while WMEU's MeToo format continued to offer series from the 1980s to the 2000s on its schedule, in addition to older programs.\n\nOn December 15, 2010, WCIU moved its simulcast of WWME to digital subchannel 26.3 in preparation for the January 1 launch of \"The U Too\", a general entertainment programming service that replaced the WWME simulcast on digital channel 26.2. In concurrence with the launch of The U Too, PSIP channel 48.1 was deleted (to be later used by the digital signal of WMEU-CA), while 23.1 reverted to being the virtual channel number for WWME-CA (23.2 was also discontinued, but WWME restored that subchannel with the addition of Bounce TV upon the network's September 2011 launch as part of affiliation agreement with Weigel Broadcasting).\n\nTechnical information\n\nSubchannels\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nWWME-CD2\nAs part of an affiliation agreement between the network and Weigel Broadcasting (which also included Milwaukee sister station WBME-TV), the station began carrying Bounce TV on digital subchannel 23.2 when it launched on September 26, 2011. On September 29, 2014, WWME-CD2 disaffiliated from Bounce TV to become a charter affiliate of Heroes & Icons, a Weigel-owned network focusing primarily on classic drama and action series.\n\nAnalog-to digital transition\nOn March 11, 2008, WWME signed on its digital signal on UHF channel 39, becoming the first low-power television station in the Chicago market to operate a digital signal. From early 2009 to December 2010, the station's full-power simulcast on WCIU-DT was also mapped as virtual channel 23.1, while WWME-CA was mapped to virtual channel 23.2 to prevent channel duplication.\n\nWWME-CA replaced the simulcast of WCIU's main channel on its analog signal on January 10, 2011, in favor of carrying a simulcast of WCIU's \"The U Too\" subchannel (which was otherwise carried on digital subchannel 26.2). In September 2013, with the upgrade of \"The U Too\"'s programming to high definition (as shown on WMEU-CD channel 48.1), the WWME analog signal was shifted to a simulcast of WCIU's \"MeToo\" service on digital subchannel 26.4; the analog simulcast of MeToo ended on January 7, 2015, with the analog signal never broadcasting any programming as a result until March 2015, when the analog signal began carrying programming from Heroes & Icons. The future of UHF channel 23 is uncertain, as a spectrum incentive auction for U.S. broadcast television stations is currently scheduled for mid-2016. WWME-CA would have been required to shut down its analog transmitter on September 1, 2015 in any event, as the FCC's since-delayed digital transition for low-power stations did not affect Class A-licensed stations.\n\nWWME-CA shut down its analog signal on January 7, 2015. No termination notification campaign was produced as was done in 2009, as it was assumed most viewers had made the transition years before to WWME's digital signal with the full-power analog transition.\n\nAnalog nightlight programming\nOn June 12, 2009, WWME converted its analog signal into a simulcast of full-power sister station WCIU-TV, in order to provide an analog nightlight signal following the digital television transition. From June 13 to July 12, 2009, WWME also carried simulcasts of morning and early evening newscasts from NBC owned-and-operated station WMAQ-TV (channel 5), along with the 9:00 p.m. newscast from WCIU's sports broadcast partner WGN-TV (channel 9), except on nights when WGN aired sports telecasts. The regular MeTV schedule continued to air on WCIU-TV digital channel 26.3 and WWME-LD 23.1 (digital channel 39).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nWeigel Broadcasting\nWME-CD\nTelevision channels and stations established in 1987\n1987 establishments in Illinois\nMeTV affiliates\nWME-CD\nHeroes & Icons affiliates\nOnTV4U affiliates"}

It was owned by Frank Whisenant, a Decatur businessman whose company, Tennessee Valley Radio & Television Corporation, also owned WMSL radio (AM 1400, now WWTM). Both stations took their calls from Mutual Savings Life Insurance Company, who founded WMSL radio in 1935.\n\nWMSL-TV originally carried programming from all four networks of the time—NBC, CBS, ABC and the DuMont Network—but was a primary NBC affiliate. It lost the DuMont Network when that one began closing down in 1955; it lost ABC when WAAY-TV started in Huntsville in 1959 as an ABC affiliate; and, finally, lost CBS when WHNT-TV began transmitting as a CBS affiliate in 1963.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, WMSL was also affiliated briefly with the NTA Film Network.\n\nUntil the early 1960s, Decatur was the largest city in the viewing area, and it was centrally located—thus making it a good location for the region's first TV station. However, when Huntsville became the region's largest city due to the exponential growth of U.S. Army Missile Command and NASA installations, Whisenant decided to move WMSL-TV there as well; it was the only major station in the market licensed in Decatur. Whisenant applied to change WMSL-TV's city of license to Huntsville as well, even though the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had changed its regulations so it could have kept its license in Decatur. However, because the station's original channel assignment, channel 23, was too close in frequency to the area's Alabama Educational Television outlet, WHIQ (channel 25), the FCC required WMSL-TV to move to channel 48 as a condition on its permit to relocate its city of license. The move to a higher UHF frequency was highly unusual for that time, especially during the 1960s, when the All-Channel Receiver Act had only recently been passed. Many UHF stations that had started operations on channels above 40 or so were able to move to lower allocations per FCC action, or even to VHF.\n\nWMSL-TV began broadcasting on channel 48 in January 1969, while simulcasting on channel 23 for several days afterwards. Some weeks later, Whisenant closed the station's studios in Decatur when the new studios opened in Huntsville. In the meantime, Whisenant sold WMSL radio to Clete Quick, another Decatur businessman.\n\nEarly years in Huntsville (1969–1974)\nOn September 1, 1967, about 16 months before moving to Huntsville, WMSL-TV had to begin sharing the NBC affiliation for North Alabama with WAAY-TV (meaning the market had no local ABC affiliate for a year; the network was available only on out-of-market stations in Birmingham, Nashville, and Chattanooga that were carried by area cable systems). Still, the new channel 48, which took over WAAY-TV's old ABC affiliation when its NBC contract expired in September 1968, made persistent efforts to serve its greatly expanded viewing area, which now included most of the Shoals region of northwestern Alabama.\n\nCall sign and ownership changes\nIn October 1974, Whisenant sold the station to Vermont-based International Television Corporation, which renamed the station WYUR-TV on March 9, 1975. Despite more aggressive attempts to promote its newscast, WYUR's ratings were far behind WAAY and WHNT. Then, on June 6, 1978, AFLAC, then known by its full name of American Family Life Assurance Company, bought the station, re-christening it WAFF after its slogan of the time, \"American Families Finest\". Some months earlier, on December 11, 1977, WAAY decided to return to ABC, as that network had become the nation's most popular, in prime time programming especially; in turn, this left channel 48 returning with the then-less-desirable NBC affiliation. AFLAC did not immediately turn the corner with WAFF; the station kept fine-tuning its newscasts and acquiring some nationally popular syndicated programs, but very little seemed to work.\n\nStill, the station pressed forward; around 1980 or 1981 a new tower was constructed on the south end of Monte Sano, adjacent to the station's studios.  The tower measured some  in height and was constructed in an effort to provide better reception to viewers across northern Alabama and southern middle Tennessee. The weather forecaster at the time, Glenn Bracken, held a coloring contest for schoolchildren across the viewing area, whereby they could depict their scenes of the new \"tall tower\" and incorporate WAFF's marketing message \"New Tall Tower Means More Picture Power\" and have their drawing and name presented during the nightly weather forecast (which usually took place on a balcony outside the news studio's doors). Also, during this period, WAFF began airing promotional spots showing various scenes of its news personalities interacting with residents of its viewing area, along with its news helicopter, \"Sky48,\" to a song titled \"We're Your Kind of People.\"\n\n1982 studio fire and aftermath\nOn the evening of March 24, 1982, the station's building, situated on Monte Sano to overlook Huntsville proper, caught fire and burned. Local firefighters found the fire hydrant at the end of the driveway had yet to be connected to the water main and the water pressure of nearby hydrants were low; this situation would later prompt competitor WHNT to relocate to downtown Huntsville, some years later. It was a few days when WAFF began broadcasting through the auspices of local cable companies, who provided NBC programming feeds from WSMV-TV in Nashville (which later became a sister station of WAFF) and WVTM-TV in Birmingham, both of which were available in their own rights on many northern Alabama cable systems prior to 1990. Eventually, WAFF would rebuild at a new location, occupying a former jewelry store on North Memorial Parkway, some miles away from Monte Sano; microwave links connected the studios to the transmitter and tower. The fire would also prompt Huntsville city officials to repair the water pressure situation and build a new fire station atop Monte Sano, which sits directly across from WAAY's studios.\n\nRecent history (1980s–present)\n\nThe disaster may have proved to be a blessing in disguise, as AFLAC began investing money in developing talent and production facilities, enabling WAFF to start making a serious ratings impact for the first time since the early 1970s. Not only did the station benefit from the renewed popularity of NBC in the mid-1980s, but its acquisitions of highly popular syndicated shows like The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jeopardy!, and Wheel of Fortune made it a hit with viewers in the Tennessee Valley region. Since that time, the station has experienced continued success.\n\nAFLAC sold WAFF, along with its other broadcasting properties, to Raycom Media of Montgomery, Alabama in 1996, making it a soon-to-be sister station to Montgomery's WSFA, which became the flagship of the said company in the next decade.\n\nSale to Gray Television\nOn June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WAFF), and Gray's 93 television stations) under Gray's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion—in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom—resulted in WAFF gaining a new sister station in an adjacent market, including CBS affiliate WVLT-TV in Knoxville, Tennessee as well as its sister station WBXX-TV (while separating it from WTNZ). The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019.\n\nProgramming\nWAFF clears the entire NBC schedule. Syndicated programs currently airing on WAFF include Tamron Hall, The Kelly Clarkson Show, and Wheel of Fortune among others. WAFF has aired Wheel since 1984; however, WAAY's carriage of Jeopardy! makes the Tennessee Valley one of the few regions of the country in which the two game shows, which have always been produced by the same packager, do not air on the same station.\n\nPerhaps the most popular of WMSL's local programs was the weekday children's show hosted by station general manager Benny Carle, a Birmingham native who honed his talents for many years on WBRC-TV there. The show was typical for its day, featuring about 10 to 15 school-aged children in the studio with the host, who conducted party games, told stories, and engaged in clownish behavior; cartoons were shown during the one-hour (later 30-minute) late-afternoon (later mid-morning) program. He began the show in the mid-1960s, while the station was still in Decatur, and continued it until 1975, when ABC's Good Morning America took over its morning time slot. Carle owned radio station WBCF and low-power TV station WBCF-LP in Florence, Alabama, which he established after leaving channel 48. Carle died on October 2, 2014, at the age of 89. Another notable program during that period was a Saturday-afternoon teenage dance show, which ran after the similar American Bandstand (although the local show more closely resembled Soul Train), that holds the honor of being the first television program exclusively aimed at northern Alabama's African-American population. The program was hosted by Nat Tate, who until his 2007 death worked for radio stations in the Decatur area and served as a Baptist minister.\n\nWAFF made a controversial decision in the mid-1980s to preempt Late Night with David Letterman (and on Fridays, Friday Night Videos) in favor of evangelist Jimmy Swaggart's daily half-hour program at 11:30 p.m. for several years, largely to cater to the area's conservative religious population and in the likelihood that it would bring in more money than local ad revenues would for Letterman's show. The station opted to sign off at midnight rather than tape delay the NBC shows for later airing. Also, WAFF made the decision to run the Swaggart program at a time when many area residents did not have access to religious programming on cable television, as would be the case in later years. However, Letterman and FNV were eventually picked up by ABC affiliate (and former full-time NBC outlet) WAAY (airing after Nightline) and aired there until Swaggart's sexual scandal in 1988 impacted his ministry to the point that he had to cancel the daily program. Thereafter, WAFF returned both Letterman and FNV to their regular timeslots and continues to this day to air NBC's entire late-night schedule without preemptions. WAAY also cleared several NBC daytime shows, between 9 and 10 a.m. Central Time before ABC's daytime programming began for the day, that WAFF passed on during this period as well.\n\nNews operation\nAt 4:30 a.m. on October 25, 2010, WAFF began broadcasting its news programming in high definition, making it the first station in the Huntsville television market to do so. However, while the station's studio shots are in high definition, much of WAFF's field video has remained in widescreen standard definition even after rival WHNT-TV upgraded to full high-definition newscasts in February 2011.\n\nAs with the other two major-network Huntsville stations, weather forecasting became a very high priority for WAFF in the 1990s, especially after the city experienced a devastating tornado in November 1989. The station constructed a Doppler radar and began to use highly sophisticated meteorological equipment.\n\nWAFF's \"First Alert Doppler Radar\" (formerly \"Live Stormtracker Doppler\"), which was located in Limestone County, Alabama just off of U.S. Route 72, was destroyed when it was hit by a large and violent tornado (which produced EF5 damage in nearby Tanner, approximately  away from the radar site) on April 27, 2011. A camera mounted on the tower showed the tornado approaching the radar moments before it struck; aerial footage taken after the tornado showed that the radar's tower remained standing despite being in the tornado's damage path. However, the large ball on top containing the radar equipment was destroyed and never found. In March 2012, WAFF installed a 1 million watt C-Band doppler radar system supplied by Huntsville-based Baron Services to replace the previously destroyed radar terminal. That company was formed by former WAFF meteorologist (who also worked for WAAY previously) Bob Baron.\n\nRaycom News Network and Raycom Weather Network\nWAFF is part of the Raycom News Network, a system designed to rapidly share information among a group of four Raycom-owned stations and websites serving the state of Alabama. A regional network has developed among Columbus/Phenix City's WTVM, Montgomery's WSFA, and Birmingham's WBRC in which stations share information, equipment such as satellite trucks or even reporters' stories. Between them, these four stations cover the state of Alabama. The four stations also comprise the Raycom Weather Network and the Raycom Alabama Weather Blog, where meteorologists from all four stations post forecasts and storm reports, as well as live feeds from all of the cameras that the four stations operate. The site also has live feeds of the radars of WTVM, WSFA, WBRC and WAFF. The only ex-Raycom station in Alabama (which is no longer a sister station of WAFF) not participating in the arrangement is WDFX-TV in the Dothan area, which formerly received its news programming from WSFA.\n\nIn popular culture\nWAFF received national media attention on July 29, 2010, when a report aired on July 28 became a viral video known as the \"Bed Intruder Song\". The video features the reaction of Antoine Dodson in response to a rape attempt on his sister, Kelly Dodson.\n\nTechnical information\n\nSubchannels\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nAnalog-to-digital conversion\nWAFF shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 48, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. It, according to an FCC filing, was to relocate to channel 48 and increase power. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 49 to channel 48; there also was an increase in transmitter height in December 2011. The accompanying planned increase in transmitter power, however, was considerably reduced. This resulted in the station broadcasting at 48 kW ERP instead of the originally planned 356 kW ERP.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWAFF-TV\nStation's 60th Anniversary page\nHuntsville Rewound\nBenny Carle-Classic Alabama TV (on station and GM from 1965–1977)\n\nNBC network affiliates\nBounce TV affiliates\nCircle (TV network) affiliates\nGrit (TV network) affiliates\nLaff (TV network) affiliates\nDefy TV affiliates\nGray Television\nTelevision channels and stations established in 1954\nAFF\n1954 establishments in Alabama"}

{"id": "4105303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konak%2C%20%C4%B0zmir", "title": "Konak, İzmir", "text": "Konak is a municipality and district of İzmir Province, Turkey. Its area is 24 km2, and its population is 332,277 (2022). It is the most densely populated of the thirty districts of İzmir, and has historically acted as the administrative and economic core of the city. Situated in an area that roughly corresponds to the geographic center of İzmir, Konak extends for  along the southern coastline of the Gulf of İzmir. Konak district area neighbors the district areas of Bornova to the east, Balçova to the west and Buca and Karabağlar to the south. Konak center is connected to other districts of İzmir and beyond by a dense network of roads and railroads, as well as by a subway line currently being largely extended and by ferry services to Karşıyaka. Konak is a very active hub of industry, trade, commerce and services, with the number of companies exceeding sixty thousand and its exports nearing two billion US dollars in 2006.\n\nLocation and administration \n\nThe name \"Konak\" was previously used for İzmir's historic core neighborhood, as well as for its key central square (Konak Square – Konak Meydanı). For example, Karşıyaka along the opposing northern shore did not always consider itself as an integral part of İzmir, or in any case, had marking specificities and points of rivalry.\n\nAdministrative history of Konak started in 1983–1984 when the steps towards the constitution of a Metropolitan Municipality of İzmir, itself divided into districts, were taken. In 1987, the territory of former district of central İzmir of was renamed the district of Konak (with the exception of its former dependency of Buca, which was turned into a separate district), and the name İzmir implies the entire metropolitan area since then. The municipality of Konak came into effect in full terms in July 1988. The district of Karabağlar was created in 2008 from part of the district of Konak.\n\nKonak district area starts at the tip of the Gulf of İzmir and follows the southern shoreline, covering such prominent neighborhoods of İzmir as, respectively from east to west, Alsancak with its international freight and passenger port, Konak Square proper and Kemeraltı and Çankaya bazaar areas and Kültürpark, where İzmir International Fair is held, immediately behind it, Karataş, the former Jewish neighborhood marked by Asansör building, and Göztepe, famous for its football team, among others, further along the coast towards the west, as well as the hillside zone behind these, notably the quarters of Eşrefpaşa and Hatay.\n\nFor both the metropolitan area and İzmir Province in general, Konak still represents the administrative nerve center, with the governorship, the offices of İzmir Metropolitan Municipality, the commercial areas, and other important administrative and private headquarters being situated within the boundaries of Konak.\n\nThe name konak itself means, inter alia, government house or official residence in Turkish and refers in the case of Konak, İzmir, to the residence built for the governor between 1869–1972 at the spot and as a replacement of the mansion of Katipzade, a family of notables who controlled the city and the region between 1750–1820. The new building was intended to emphasize the prestige acquired by a growing international trade center and its design and furnishings were consequently luxurious. The building marked the move for the seat of the vilayet of Aydın to İzmir, initiated in 1865.\n\nIn recent years, there is a move toward decentralization and shift also to other districts of İzmir by official and private headquarters, notably with the building of a new and huge Hall of Justice in Bornova.\n\nHistory \n\nThe core areas of Konak Square and Kemeraltı were formed with the filling in due course during the 17th century of the shallow inner bay of İzmir and immediate outer coastal reaches. Kemeraltı bazaar came into existence with the filling between 1650–1670 of the shallowest parts of the bay and the process of gaining ground from the sea bay was pursued progressively. The shoreline took its present form by the end of the 18th century in approximate terms, although some of the land along the berth remained unused till the mid-19th century. \nIn 1829, Sarı Kışla, the Yellow Casern, the principal Ottoman casern of the city, gigantic for its time, was built at immediate sea-side, and a private residence (konak) situated slightly diagonally behind the casern was extended and converted into the governor's mansion, demarcating Konak Square that holds its name from the mansion, and which in its turn gave the name to the central metropolitan district of İzmir (Konak), and at the level of which Kemeraltı is considered to start.\n\nThe Yellow Casern was demolished in 1955 under express instructions from the then Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, who wanted to see Konak Square re-shaped, to the continuing regret of many Smyrniots who had come to adopt the oversize building as one of the main landmarks of their city. Konak Square is still where the best symbols of İzmir are found.\n\nEconomy and education \nThe number of companies registered in Konak district was 58,199 in 2006. Exports realized by the district's companies reached 1,824,101,418 the same year. 26 banks are present across Konak district area and they provide services through 209 branches. Roughly 304,000 residential buildings make up Konak's settlement. It is notable to observe that, according to the figures provided by the prefecture, residential areas make up only around 10–15 per cent of Konak's urban zone, while a huge proportion of 75–80 per cent is classified as land being used for commercial and/or industrial purposes.\n\nThe literacy rate is close to hundred per cent, a minimal two per cent ratio of illiteracy accounted for principally by new immigrants to the district. There are 23 students for each teacher, and 2,085 patients for each doctor in Konak. While İzmir's universities mostly have their campuses in other districts of the metropolitan area, these preserve an important presence in Konak through their administrative buildings and depending educational institutions, and some among the higher education establishments of fresher date chose Konak as initial base. Konak is also home to a number of deep-rooted high schools well known across Turkey.\n\nBusiness centers  \n\nThe district is the home of some large business centers including Heris Tower, Birsel Plaza, Kavala Plaza and Arkas Building. Of İzmir largest business plazas, Heris Tower is the largest as of 2004 with 600 people working there. Heris Tower was one of the tallest building of Izmir and as of 2014 it was still one of only 9 high-rise buildings in İzmir. And as of mid 2021 was still the 15th tallest building in İzmir. Heris Tower () is a  tall office skyscraper in İzmir, Turkey. in the commercial Akdeniz neighborhood on Şehit Fethi Bey Avenue, the building is the seventh tallest building in İzmir and the 99th tallest building in Turkey. Heris Tower was completed in 2001 and was the second tallest building in the city on completion. With a blue pyramid at the tip, Heris Tower shares a resemblance with the Mellon Bank Building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nComposition\nThere are 113 neighbourhoods in Konak District:\n\n 26 Ağustos\n Akarcalı\n Akdeniz\n Akın Simav\n Akıncı\n Ali  Reis\n Alsancak\n Altay\n Altınordu\n Altıntaş\n Anadolu\n Atamer\n Atilla\n Aziziye\n Ballıkuyu\n Barbaros\n Birinci Kadriye\n Boğaziçi\n Bozkurt\n Çahabey\n Çankaya\n Cengiz Topel\n Çimentepe\n Çınarlı\n Çınartepe\n Dayıemir\n Dolaplıkuyu\n Duatepe\n Ege\n Emirsultan\n Etiler\n Faikpaşa\n Fatih\n Ferahlı\n Fevzipaşa\n Göztepe\n Güneş\n Güneşli\n Güney\n Güngör\n Güzelyalı\n Güzelyurt\n Halkapınar\n Hasan Özdemir\n Hilal\n Hurşidiye\n Huzur\n İkinci Kadriye\n İmariye\n İsmet Kaptan\n İsmetpaşa\n Kadifekale\n Kahramanlar\n Kahramanmescit\n Kemalreis\n Kestelli\n Kılıçreis\n Kocakapı\n Kocatepe\n Konak\n Kosova\n Kubilay\n Küçükada\n Kültür\n Kurtuluş\n Lale\n Levent\n M.

The Turkish name Kadifekale literally means \"the velvet castle\" and is used both for the castle and for the hill on whose summit the castle is situated. The summit is located at a distance of about  from the shoreline and commands a general view of a large part of the city of İzmir, as well as of the Gulf of İzmir.\n\nAgora of Smyrna \n\nAs is the case with Pagos hilltop castle at Kadifekale, the foundation of the second city of Smyrna to replace its Archaic Period predecessor at what is Bayraklı district today, is associated and contemporaneous with Alexander the Great, although the present-day remains date from later periods. In the case of ancient Smyrna, the ruins are centered around the Roman period Agora of the city, rebuilt after a 178 AD earthquake, although much evidence leads to the conclusion that further research could bring many other vestiges of the antique city to daylight. A new drive in the last decade, once the excavations were placed under the authority of İzmir's Metropolitan Municipal Administration, led to new acquisitions of land around the site of the Agora, incurring considerable expenses and with the objective of enlarging the area to explore.\n\nFirst scientific explorations at the Agora of Smyrna were conducted by Charles Texier in late-1830s and the present state of the site as accessible to visitors is the consequence of the work accomplished between 1931 and 1942 by the archaeologists Rudolf Naumann and Selâhattin Kantar.\n\nKonak Square and Kemeraltı (grand bazaar) \n\nKonak Square is the central point where the structure that became İzmir city's symbol, İzmir Clock Tower, built upon decision of the city council by the Levantine French architect Raymond Charles Père on the occasion of Sultan Abdülhamid II's silver jubilee (1901), is found.\n\nThe tower is in front of İzmir Governor's official residence (Konak), an almost identical replica of the original building built between 1869 and 1872, which itself was lost to a fire in 1970. Between the two structures, the tower and the \"konak\", is a very small mosque, a curiosity today and which was formerly annexed by a medrese, which also dates from the time of the Katipzade, having been built around 1755.\n\nThe eastern end of Konak Square is marked by Konak Pier, a 19th-century construction whose steelworks are claimed to have been designed by Gustave Eiffel. The western end is the location of another 19th-century Levantine/European landmark of the city (see below), İzmir Ethnography and Archaeology Museum, originally built as an orphanage. The central part of the square, just next to the Clock Tower and the Governor's Mansion, leads access to Kemeraltı bazaar area and to the Agora of Smyrna beyond at the bazaar's land's end.\n\nCovering the area between Konak Square and the Agora of Smyrna, Kemeraltı Bazaar is a part of İzmir where residential buildings are practically absent and which consists, not on only of hundreds of commercial establishments but also of numerous religious buildings (historic mosques and synagogues) concentrated in walking distance from each other. İzmir center's two largest churches, a Catholic church dedicated to Polycarp and the Greek Orthodox church of \"Aya Vukla\", premises of the archaeological museum until recently and currently in phase of being restored, are also located slightly outside Kemeraltı zone. The entire area corresponds to İzmir's small inner bay which existed until the 18th century and is thus land gained from the sea. 1590-built Hisar Mosque and the 1744-built Kızlarağası led the pace for the establishment of a commercial zone here which is still marked by many buildings of İzmir's Ottoman period.\n\nKordon (seaside promenade) \n\nAlsancak is a neighborhood of well-designed streets and modern apartment blocks and stores and also where İzmir's trendiest and the most expensive and exclusive residences and commercial space are found here, as well as the busiest office buildings, including consulates. It extends along the First Kordon and the Second Kordon, the first having taken present-day look with the construction of İzmir's new port installations between 1867–1876. With the project, the wharf (Pasaport Quay), as well as a 3250 m long combination of a landing stage, of a street served by a tram line and of an esplanade (Kordon) came into existence, all built on land gained from the sea, and profoundly changing the city's look.\n\nMany restaurants, bars, cafes, discothèques and other entertainment venues are concentrated in Alsancak, increasingly within the intact rows of older and more traditional one- or two-storied buildings found in the inner smaller streets and are often restored specifically for the purpose of the intended commercial activity.\n\nAsansör (elevator) \n\nAsansör (Turkish for \"elevator\") is a building in Konak's Karataş neighborhood and it was built in 1907 as a work of public service by a wealthy Jewish banker and trader of that period, Nesim Levi Bayraklıoğlu, in order to ease passage for people and goods from the narrow coastline of Karataş to the hillside along its steep cliff. The small street that led to the building was recently renamed Darío Moreno in memory of the singer who used to live there before attaining fame in Europe.\n\nKültürpark \n\nKültürpark, behind Alsancak's coastal strait at a short distance, is considered the cradle of Turkey's fairs and expositions industry, and is notable for hosting a series of simultaneous festival activities.\n\nSee also \n\n Alsancak, luxury neighborhood\n Dr. Selahattin Akçiçek Cultural Center\n Eşrefpaşa, deep-rooted popular neighborhood\n Göztepe, neighborhood famous for its football team\n Güzelyalı Bridge\n Hatay, İzmir another important neighborhood\n Kadifekale, historic hilltop castle and neighborhood\n Karataş, traditional Jewish quarter\n Kemeraltı bazaar zone\n Konak Square\n Timeline of İzmir\n\nFootnotes\n\nResources\n\nExternal links \n\n Metropolitan Municipality of Greater İzmir\n Dokuz Eylül University Forum\n Walking routes inside the city\n\n \nDistricts of İzmir Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey"}

{"id": "4105311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GM%20New%20Look%20bus", "title": "GM New Look bus", "text": "The GM New Look bus is a municipal transit bus that was introduced in 1959 by the Truck and Coach Division of General Motors to replace the company's previous coach, retroactively known as the GM \"old-look\" transit bus.\n\nAlso commonly known by the nickname \"Fishbowl\" (for its original six-piece rounded windshield, later replaced by a two-piece curved pane), it was produced until 1977 in the US, and until 1985 in Canada. More than 44,000 New Look buses were built. Its high production figures and long service career made it an iconic North American transit bus. The design is listed as  by Roland E. Gegoux and William P. Strong.\n\nProduction overview\n44,484 New Look buses were built over the production lifespan, of which 33,413 were built in the U.S. and 11,071 were built in Canada (GM Diesel Division).  Separated by general type, the production figures comprised 510  city buses (all U.S.-built);  9,355  city buses (7,804 U.S.-built, 1,551 Canadian);  31,348   city buses (22,034 U.S., 9,314 Canadian) and 3,271 suburban coaches (of which only 206 were built in Canada).  The total production of New Looks was 41,213 transit coaches and 3,271 suburban coaches.\n\nOther than demonstrators, Washington, D.C., was the very first city to take delivery of any GM New Look buses, specifically TDH-5301s built in 1959 for O. Roy Chalk's D.C. Transit System, which operated in Washington, D.C., and the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia.\n\nSeveral different models were introduced over the following years, and modifications made to the design. See the section below, headed \"Description\".\n\nProduction of the New Look in the U.S. ceased in 1977, when it was replaced by the RTS transit bus. Production continued after this, however, at General Motors Diesel Division in Canada, due to the RTS design being rejected by Canadian transit agencies, with the name plate changing from \"GM\" to \"GMC\". Few were produced after 1983 due to the GMDD's introduction of the Classic in that year. The last New Looks to be built were an order for Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines (now Big Blue Bus) of Santa Monica, California, in 1986. The completion of that order brought a final end to New Look production in April 1986. A few transit systems are still operating them to this day (including Société de transport de l'Outaouais in Gatineau, Quebec), nearly 60 years after introduction and more than 30 years after mass production ended.\n\nThe last American-built New Look GM buses were ordered by the city of Wausau, Wisconsin, which placed an order for twelve  transit buses, model T6H-4523N, the last of which was delivered in March 1977.\n\nThe GM Buffalo bus, a group of intercity bus models built between 1966 and 1980, shared many mechanical and body parts with the fishbowl models, and were discontinued by the Pontiac, Michigan, plant shortly after the RTS replaced fishbowl model production there.\n\nGM later sold the rights to produce both Classic and RTS models to other manufacturers, and exited the heavy-duty transit and intercity markets for full-sized buses, although production of some medium-duty and light-duty chassis products sold in these markets continued.\n\nDescription\nLike GM's over-the-road buses, including the Greyhound Scenicruiser, the air-sprung New Look did not have a traditional ladder frame. Instead it used an airplane-like stressed-skin construction in which an aluminum riveted skin supported the weight of the bus. The wooden floor kept the bus's shape. The engine cradle was hung off the back of the roof. As a result, the GM New Look weighed significantly less than competitors' city buses.\n\nVirtually all New Look buses were powered by Detroit Diesel Series 71 two-cycle diesel engines. The original engine was the 6V71 (V6). GM buses used a unique \"Angle-drive\" configuration with a transverse mounted engine. The transmission angled off at a 45-or-so degree angle to connect to the rear axle. The engines were canted backwards for maintenance access; in fact, the only parts not accessible from outside the bus were the right-hand exhaust manifold and the starter. The entire engine-transmission-radiator assembly was mounted on a cradle that could be quickly removed and replaced, allowing the bus to return to service with minimal delay when the powertrain required major maintenance. Originally, all New Looks were powered by the 6V-71. GM resisted V8 power but eventually gave in to pressure from customers.\n\n(The exception to the above was the  TDH-3301, which was powered by the GMC DH-478 Toroflow four-stroke V6, and had a more conventional T-drive transmission.)\n\nOriginal transmission choices were a four-speed non-synchronized manual transmission with solenoid reverse and the Allison Automatic VH hydraulic transmission. The latter was essentially a one-speed automatic transmission which drove the wheels through a torque converter. At sufficient speed a clutch bypassed the torque converter and the engine drove the rear wheels directly. A later option was the VS-2, similar to the VH but with a two-speed planetary gearset with three modes: Hydraulic, direct (1:1), and direct-overdrive. The very last batch of American-built New Looks and most Canadian-built New Looks from 1977 through 1987 use the Allison V730 transmission, a traditional three-speed automatic with a lockup torque converter. These four transmissions were the only V-drive transmissions made.\n\nNew Looks were available in both Transit and Suburban versions. Transits were traditional city buses with two doors; Suburbans had forward-facing seats (four-abreast), underfloor luggage bays, and had only one door. The floor beneath the seats was higher than the center aisle to accommodate the luggage bays. There were also \"Suburban-style\" transits which had forward-facing seats on slightly raised platforms that gave the appearance of a dropped center aisle. GM refused to install lavatories on these buses; at least one transit authority (Sacramento Transit Authority in Sacramento, California) added its own.\n\nThe New Look was built in ,  and  lengths and  widths.  buses had different-length side windows, so the profiles of both buses looked very similar, but not the same. In the 1970s, AC Transit shortened several 35' New Look buses to 29' by removing a section from the middle for dial-a-ride demand-responsive service, maintaining common parts and drivers with the remainder of its fleet.\n\nIn 1967 and 1968, Red Arrow Lines tested a GM New Look bus converted to operate as a railbus on its interurban routes and the Norristown High Speed Line.\n\nVariants based on the New Look\nTurbine engines\nGeneral Motors had been interested in developing gas turbine engines for highway use and showed the General Motors Firebird series of turbine-powered sports car concepts in the 1950s; to demonstrate the engine's practicality, GM fitted a copy of the same GT-300 \"Whirlfire\" engine from Firebird I into an \"old-look\" TDH-4512 transit bus and called it the \"Turbo-Cruiser\". For the 1964 New York World's Fair, the latest version of the gas turbine engine, designated GT-309, was fitted to a New Look bus (TDH-5303, serial #0001) and named \"Turbo-Cruiser II\"; the GT-309 was also fitted to the Chevrolet Tilt-Cab truck chassis and called \"Turbo Titan III\". The GT-309 developed power and torque comparable to the 8V-71 and weighed less, but fuel consumption and emissions proved to be intractable problems. The same TDH-5303 was later equipped with a continuously-variable transmission and rebranded \"Turbo-Cruiser III\". Production records also indicate a \"Turbo-Cruiser V\" was built using a T8H-5305A in 1969. The Turbo-Cruiser III drivetrain also was used on the \"RTX\" (Rapid Transit eXperimental) bus of 1968, prototyping the styling and features of the Rapid Transit Series, which succeeded the New Look buses starting in 1977.\n\nTrolley buses\n\nIn 1981–82, Brown Boveri & Company constructed 100 model HR150G trolley buses from  New Look bus shells for the Edmonton Transit System (ETS). Two coaches (No. 192 and 197) were sent to the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) for evaluation as potential supplements to the aging Flyer E700 trolley bus fleet in 1989 and placed in revenue service in January 1990; pleased with the results, TTC leased 38 more for a three-year term, starting in June 1990. All the leased buses were in the group of ETS fleet numbers between #149 and #199; in TTC service, the leased buses were renumbered with a leading 9 but retained their ETS livery and colors. TTC decided to discontinue trolley bus service in January 1992 to reduce operating costs; as ETS would not allow an early return of the leased buses, TTC continued to run the leased buses on two routes until July 1993.\n\nBack in Edmonton, 19 of the returned trolley buses were retired and used for spare parts, while the rest of the fleet remained in use for 27 years until the Edmonton trolley bus system was shut down in 2009. 28 were sold to Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in an attempt to save the trolleybus system there, but they were abandoned after the Plovdiv trolleybus system shut down as well in 2012. Although they were transferred to Yambol, which had built a trolleybus network but did not have the vehicles to operate it, they were eventually scrapped in 2015 after the city abandoned its plans to open a trolleybus system there as well. A few were preserved after ETS shut down the trolleybus system in 2009: the Illinois Railway Museum received #181 in Fall 2009 and the Seashore Trolley Museum received #125 in 2010.\n\nArticulated buses\n\nA  articulated version was designed and built in 1982 for a Government of Ontario demonstration project. While a New Look body was used, a newer front (to allow a wider entrance), which would eventually be incorporated into the Classic transit bus, was used. For this reason, this model is sometimes not described as being a New Look and is not included in New Look production figures.\n\nSeries production took place in 1982–1983, and a total of only 53 were built. With the newer front and older body, these buses, which were model TA60-102N (for Transit Articulated 60 feet long × 102 inches wide No air-conditioning), were a transitional model. Unlike most other articulated buses with an engine in the front section and a powered middle axle, the TA60-102N utilized a \"pusher\" design that used a conventional New Look drive train and a specially-designed anti-jackknifing articulated joint that limited the angle between the two section to 7° at normal speeds (while traveling straight forward) and to less than 2° at highway speeds. 12 were tested by TTC in 1982, but TTC chose to purchase a fleet of Orion III articulated buses instead.\n\nModel naming\nThe model naming for the GM New Look bus is shown below. Examples of model names are TDH-5301, T8H-5305N, T6H-5307N, S6H-4504A, and T6H-4521N. (Note that not all possible combinations were constructed.) The front end of the bus remained essentially the same through the production of the New Look.\n\nManufacturing location was indicated by the serial number. No prefix was used for Pontiac, Michigan, C (Canada) indicated London, Ontario, and M (Montreal) Saint-Eustache, Quebec. All buses with 17-digit VINs were built in Saint-Eustache.\n\nProduction figures by model\nProduction totals are through August 1980, when serial numbers changed to 17-digit vehicle identification numbers.\n\nSee also\n\nGM \"old-look\" transit bus - predecessor model\nFlxible New Look bus - its main competitor\nFlyer 700/800/900 series - another competitor\nRapid Transit Series - one of two successor models\nClassic (transit bus) - the Canadian successor model\nList of buses\nA bus of this series was prominently featured in the 1994 movie Speed.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\nBurness, Tad (1985).

Ogden) is a generalization of the pumping lemma for context-free languages.\n\nStatement \n\nWe will use underlines to indicate \"marked\" positions.\n\nSpecial cases \nOgden's lemma is often stated in the following form, which can be obtained by \"forgetting about\" the grammar, and concentrating on the language itself:\nIf a language  is context-free, then there exists some number  (where  may or may not be a pumping length) such that for any string  of length at least  in  and every way of \"marking\"  or more of the positions in ,  can be written as\n\nwith strings  and , such that\n\n has at least one marked position,\n has at most  marked positions, and\n for all .\n\nIn the special case where every position is marked, Ogden's lemma is equivalent to the pumping lemma for context-free languages. Ogden's lemma can be used to show that certain languages are not context-free in cases where the pumping lemma is not sufficient. An example is the language .\n\nExample applications\n\nNon-context-freeness \nThe special case of Ogden's lemma is often sufficient to prove some languages are not context-free.

{"id": "4105322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiday%20race", "title": "Multiday race", "text": "Multiday races are ultramarathon running events which are typically either segmented into daily events of a specified distance or time, or staged so that runners can run as far as they want, at their own discretion, over a set course or over a set number of days. Multiday races can range from continuous 48-hour track events to staged transcontinental treks.\n\nBeyond the marathon\nVery long endurance running events can be divided into three broad categories:  the traditional  marathon, the ultramarathon, defined as any event longer than the marathon, and true multiday events, which begin with the 24-hour event and can stretch out almost indefinitely, often ranging from six days to  or longer.\n\nMultiday events are usually timed races such as 48-hour, 72-hour and 6 day races. Set distance races depend on the ability of the runner to complete and what may be a multiday for slower runners may be an ultra to faster athletes. For example the Badwater Ultramarathon, a  race, has a 48 hour time limit, but winners typically finish in under 24 hours.\n\nTypes of courses\nMany multiday races are held on tracks or measured loops, which eases provision of aid station support for runners. Stage races are the alternative; these include point to point races such as the Trans-American races, which traverse the North American continent coast to coast, and the Gobi March, a seven-day journey across the Gobi desert, the Kalahari Augrabies Extreme Marathon, a 7-day, 250 km trail event in the Kalahari Desert, and the Yukon Arctic Ultra, a 430/300/100/26 mile challenge crossing Yukon in the dead of winter.\n\nLonger multiday races include the Trans-Europe race, which ran from Lisbon to Moscow in 2003, a distance of about 5,100 kilometers. These events take the runner to a different level, where the race becomes a way of life and where nutrition, sleep, energy and psychological states have to be carefully managed. The Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race is the longest certified footrace in the world.\n\nThe past\nThe golden era of multiday races stretches back to the 1870s and 1880s, when they were held on indoor tracks and offered substantial prizes. Known as pedestrians, these athletes established records which in some cases have stood until recently. In summer 1809 in Newmarket, England, Robert Barclay Allardice, better known as Captain Barclay, ran/walked one mile (1.6 km) for each consecutive hour, each consecutive day, totalling .\n\nThe most common multiday race of the era was the six-day race, which ran from Monday to Saturday with Sunday being observed as a rest day. In 1878, Sir John Dugdale Astley was inspired to create a series of five international six-day races, in which competitors vied for the Astley Belt. Two early competitors were the American Edward Payson Weston, who covered  in 6 days. The Englishman Charles Rowell covered 241 km in the first day of a 6-day races in the 1880s.\n\nBy the early 1890s, public enthusiasm for such events had moved into bicycle racing, and the multiday running craze came to an end. Interest grew again in the late 1920s, with the advent of Trans-America races. These events were transcontinental stage races that inspired a new generation to challenge the huge distance.\n\nThe recent past\nThere was little reward for these races in the long run, and it was not until the 1980s that interest re-awoke in true multi-day races. In 1980, San Francisco postal delivery worker  organized the first modern era six-day race, on a track in Woodside, California.\nIn recent years, several multiday races have stood out, among them the Australian Westfield Sydney to Melbourne races, which were run from 1983–1991, and the Colac (1983–2005) race which is no longer being held. August 2012 will see possibly the final 64 stage Trans-Europe race organised by Ingo Schulze.\nSri Chinmoy Races hosts several multi-day events annually in the US: six- and ten-day races, a 3,100-mile (5,000 km) race, and several 24- and 48-hour events in Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.

{"id": "4105323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korkuteli", "title": "Korkuteli", "text": "Korkuteli is a municipality and district of Antalya Province, Turkey. Its area is 2,433 km2, and its population is 56,285 (2022). It is  north-west of the city of Antalya. It was previously called İstanoz or Stenez.\n\nEtymology\nIts modern name comes from Korkut, an Ottoman prince, who was murdered by his brother Selim I while trying to hide in a cave in the district.\n\nGeography\nKorkuteli is an area of small plains and hills in the Bey Dağları, the western range of the Taurus Mountains, overlooking the Mediterranean sea. There are two distinct geographical areas of Korkuteli, of equal size: the lowland area nearer the coast has a hot Mediterranean climate, while the larger area of lakes higher up is cooler and less humid. The high country is covered with pine forest, while the lowland is used for agriculture; crops include grains, pulses and vegetable oil-seeds. There are trout in Korkuteli reservoir and other small lakes.\n\nUntil recently economic activity in this district was basically herding sheep and goats on the hillsides, but since the 1960s investment in irrigation and machinery has generated a thriving fruit-growing industry, including many roadside stalls selling fruit to travellers en route to the Mediterranean coast. This in turn has led to better buildings and infrastructure in the town of Korkuteli and the villages in the district. There is no industry or large-scale trading. Korkuteli is a small town of 15,000 people providing high schools and other basic infrastructure to the district.\n\nThe countryside is attractive and Antalya's middle-classes are building holiday homes in Korkuteli, a place to escape the summer heat on the coast. The local delicacy is 'burnt ice-cream', made of goats-milk.\n\nComposition\nThere are 59 neighbourhoods in Korkuteli District:\n\n Akyar\n Alaaddin\n Aşağıpazar\n Avdan\n Bahçeyaka\n Bayat\n Bayatbademleri\n Beğiş\n Bozova\n Büyükköy\n Çaykenarı\n Çıvgalar\n Çomaklı\n Çukurca\n Dereköy\n Duraliler\n Esenyurt\n Garipçe\n Göçerler\n Güzle\n İmecik\n İmrahor\n Karabayır\n Karakuyu\n Karataş\n Kargalık\n Kargın\n Karşıyaka\n Kayabaşı\n Kemerağzı\n Kevzer\n Kiremitli\n Kırkpınar\n Kızılaliler\n Kızılcadağ\n Köseler\n Kozağacı\n Küçükköy\n Küçüklü\n Leylek\n Mamatlar\n Manay\n Nebiler\n Osmankalfalar\n Sımandır\n Söğütcük\n Sülekler\n Taşkesiği\n Tatköy\n Uzunoluk\n Yakaköy\n Yalınlıgediği\n Yazır\n Yeleme\n Yelten\n Yeni\n Yeşiloba\n Yeşilyayla\n Yukarıkaraman\n\nHistory\n\nBuildings of the Roman and Byzantine periods in Korkuteli include the Keşiş Evi (\"priest's house\") and the building that later became the Hamidoglu Medrese, which has Latin inscriptions.\n\nThe area was taken from the Byzantines by the Seljuk Turks of Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev I in 1207, and was used as a summer residence by the local Seljuk rulers. Seljuk architecture in Korkuteli includes the mosque of Sultan Alaadin and some Turkish baths and tombs.\n\nUpon the decline of the Seljuks in the early 14th century the area became a stronghold of the Beylik of Teke and then of the Hamidid clan of nearby Isparta. Bayezid I brought the district into the Ottoman Empire in 1392.\n\nIsinda \n\nNearby was the ancient town of Isinda, whose site is now thought to be at the village of Kişla, though formerly identified with Yazır. In the 1840s, T.A.B. Spratt and E. Forbes visited Kişla, an hour's ride from Korkuteli (referred to as Stenez), with extensive walls of soft stone and burnt brick, and identified it as the city of Isinda, which the Roman consul Gnaeus Manlius Vulso, on his victorious march through Asia Minor in 189 BC, found besieged by Termessus. At the city's request he raised the siege and fined the Termessians 50 talents.\n\nIsinda stood in a strategic position at the western end of the pass leading from Pamphylia by Termessus to Pisidia. Together with Aperlae, Apollonia and Simena, Isinda was a member of a tetrapolis, a federation of four cities.\n\nSamples of the extensive coinage of Isinda are extant, which give evidence that it considered itself an Ionian colony.\n\nIsinda was later included in the Roman province of Pamphylia Secunda. At an early stage, it became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Perge, the capital of the province. Of its bishops, Cyrillus took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325, Edesius in the Council of Ephesus in 431, Marcellinus in the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Talleleus in the Second Council of Constantinople in 553, Ignatius in the Photian Council of Constantinople (879).\n\nNo longer a residential bishopric, Isinda is now listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nDemographics\nThe district has a population of 56,285 (2022). The town itself has 28,725 inhabitants.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The Antalya governorate\n\nPopulated places in Antalya Province\nDistricts of Antalya Province\n \nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nPisidia"}
{"id": "4105326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS%20tracking%20unit", "title": "GPS tracking unit", "text": "A GPS tracking unit, geotracking unit, satellite tracking unit, or simply tracker is a navigation device normally on a vehicle, asset, person or animal that uses satellite navigation to determine its movement and determine its WGS84  UTM  geographic position (geotracking) to determine its location. Satellite tracking devices may send special satellite signals that are processed by a receiver.\n\nLocations are stored in the tracking unit or transmitted to an Internet-connected device using the cellular network (GSM/GPRS/CDMA/LTE  or SMS), radio, or satellite modem embedded in the unit or WiFi work worldwide.\n\nGPS antenna size limits tracker size, often smaller than a half-dollar (diameter 30.61 mm). In 2020 tracking is a $2 billion business plus military-in the gulf war 10% or more targets used trackers. Virtually every cellphone tracks its movements.\nTracks can be map displayed in real time, using GPS tracking software and devices with GPS capability.\n\nArchitecture\nA GPS \"track me\" essentially contains a GPS module that receives the GPS signal and calculates the coordinates. For data loggers, it contains large memory to store the coordinates. Data pushers additionally contain a GSM/GPRS/CDMA/LTE modem to transmit this information to a central computer either via SMS or GPRS in form of IP packets. Satellite-based GPS tracking units will operate anywhere on the globe using satellite technology such as GlobalStar or Iridium. They do not require a cellular connection.\n\nTypes\nThere are three types of GPS trackers, though most GPS-equipped phones can work in any of these modes depending on the mobile applications installed:\n\nData loggers\nGPS loggers log the position of the device at regular intervals in its internal memory. GPS loggers may have either a memory card slot, or internal flash memory card and a USB port. Some act as a USB flash drive, which allows downloading the track log data for further computer analysis. The track list or point of interest list may be in GPX, KML, NMEA or other format.\n\nMost digital cameras save the time a photo was taken. Provided the camera clock is reasonably accurate or used GPS as its time source, this time can be correlated with GPS log data, to provide an accurate location. This can be added to the Exif metadata in the picture file. Cameras with a GPS receiver built in can directly produce such a geotagged photograph.\n\nIn some private investigation cases, data loggers are used to keep track of a target vehicle. The private investigator need not follow the target too closely, and always has a backup source of data.\n\nData pushers\nA data pusher is the most common type of GPS tracking unit, used for asset tracking, personal tracking and vehicle tracking systems. Virtually every cell phone is in this mode per user agreement, even if shut off or disabled storing the data for future transmission.\n\nAlso known as a \"GPS beacon\", this kind of device push (i.e. \"sends\"), at regular intervals, the position of the device as well as other information like speed or altitude to a determined server, that can store and analyze the data instantly.\n\nA GPS navigation device and a mobile phone sit side-by-side in the same box, powered by the same battery. At regular intervals, the phone sends a text message via SMS or GPRS, containing the data from the GPS receiver. Newer GPS-integrated smartphones running GPS tracking software can turn the phone into a data pusher (or logger) device. As of 2009, open source and proprietary applications are available for common Java ME enabled phones, iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, and Symbian.\n\nMost 21st-century GPS trackers provide data \"push\" technology, enabling sophisticated GPS tracking in business environments, specifically organizations that employ a mobile workforce, such as a commercial fleet. Typical GPS tracking systems used in commercial fleet management have two core parts: location hardware (or tracking device) and tracking software. This combination is often referred to as an Automatic Vehicle Location system. The tracking device is most often hardwired installed in the vehicle, connected to the CAN-bus, ignition system switch, battery. It allows collection of extra data, which is later transferred to the GPS tracking server. There it is available for viewing, in most cases via a website accessed over the Internet, where fleet activity can be viewed live or historically using digital maps and reports.\n\nGPS tracking systems used in commercial fleets are often configured to transmit location and telemetry input data at a set update rate or when an event (door open/close, auxiliary equipment on/off, geofence border cross) triggers the unit to transmit data. Live GPS tracking used in commercial fleets generally refers to systems that update regularly at one-minute, two-minute or five-minute intervals while the ignition status is on. Some tracking systems combine timed updates with heading change triggered updates.\n\nGPS tracking solutions such as Telematics 2.0, an IoT based telematics technology for the automotive industry, are being used by mainstream commercial auto insurance companies.\n\nData pullers\nGPS data pullers are also known as \"GPS transponders\". Unlike data pushers that send the position of the devices at regular intervals (push technology), these devices are always on, and can be queried as often as required (pull technology). This technology is not in widespread use, but an example of this kind of device is a computer connected to the Internet and running gpsd.\n\nThese can often be used in the case where the location of the tracker will only need to be known occasionally (e.g. placed in property that may be stolen, or that does not have a constant source of energy to send data on a regular basis, like freight or containers.)\n\nData Pullers are coming into more common usage in the form of devices containing a GPS receiver and a cell phone which, when sent a special SMS message reply to the message with their location.\n\nCovert GPS trackers\nCovert GPS trackers contain the same electronics as regular GPS trackers but are constructed in such a way as to appear to be an everyday object. One use for covert GPS trackers is for power tool protection; these devices can be concealed within power tool boxes and traced if theft occurs.\n\nApplications\nThe applications of GPS trackers include:\n\nPersonal tracking\n Race control: in some sports, such as gliding, participants are required to carry a tracker. In particular, this allows race officials to know if the participants are cheating, taking unexpected shortcuts, and how far apart they are. This use was illustrated in the movie Rat Race.\n Law enforcement: an arrested suspect out on bail may have to wear a GPS tracker, usually an ankle monitor, as a bail condition. GPS tracking may also be ordered for persons subject to a restraining order.\n Espionage/surveillance: a tracker on a person or vehicle allows movements to be tracked.\n Vehicle tracking: some people use GPS Trackers to monitor activity of their own vehicle, especially in the event of a vehicle being used by a friend or family member.\n GPS personal tracking devices are used in the care of the elderly and vulnerable, and can be used to track small children who may get into danger. Some devices can send text alerts to carers if the wearer moves into an unexpected place. Some devices allow users to call for assistance, and optionally allow designated carers to locate the user's position, typically within five to ten meters. Their use helps promote independent living and social inclusion for the elderly. Devices often incorporate either one-way otwo-way voice communication. Some devices also allow the user to call several phone numbers using pre-programmed speed dial buttons. Trials using GPS personal tracking devices for people living with dementia are underway in several countries. Text and voice communication is usually provided by a connection to mobile telephony, but GPS devices are available that use satellite communications, always available even if out of mobile telephone range.\n Some Internet Web 2.0 pioneers have created their own personal web pages that show their position constantly, and in real time, on a map within their website. These usually use data push from a GPS enabled cell phone or a personal GPS tracker.\n Sports: the movements of a ramblers, cyclists, and so on, can be tracked. Statistics such as instantaneous and average speed, and distance travelled, are logged. In the rugby union Six Nations Championship, all players wear trackers, sewn into their shirts. Some rugby clubs also use GPS units on their players. The England Rugby Union team uses GPS.\n Adventure sports: GPS tracking devices such as the SPOT Satellite Messenger are available to allow the position of a person to be tracked. In particular, this allows rescue personnel to locate the carrier. These devices also allow the carrier to send messages and emergency alerts, even when out of cellular telephone range.\n Monitoring employees: GPS-handled tracking devices with a built-in cellphone are used to monitor employees by various companies, especially those engaged in fieldwork.\n Lone Workers : It is ideal for improving the safety of your employees working in distant, isolated work sites. Maintenance workers, forestry, mining, and employees in similar fields may be required to work in remote areas without any contact nearby, in such scenarios the risk of their well-being increases\n\nAsset tracking\n\nSolar Powered: the advantage of some solar powered units is that they have much more power over their lifetime than battery-powered units. This gives them the advantage of reporting their position and status much more often than battery units which need to conserve  energy to extend their life. Some wireless solar-powered units, such as the RailRider can report more than 20,000 times per year and work indefinitely on solar power, eliminating the need to change batteries.\n\nAircraft tracking\n\nAircraft can be tracked either by ADS-B (primarily airliners and General Aviation aircraft with ADS-B-out enabled transponder), or by FLARM data packets picked up by a network of ground stations (primarily used by General Aviation aircraft, gliders and UAVs), both of which are data pushers. ADS-B is to be superseded by ADS-C, a data puller.\n\nAnimal tracking\n\nAnimal monitoring (GPS wildlife tracking): when put on a wild animal (e.g. in a GPS collar), it allows scientists to study the animal's activities and migration patterns. Vaginal implant transmitters mark the location where pregnant females give birth. Animal tracking collars may also be put on domestic animals, to locate them in case they get lost.\n\nLegislation\n\nAustralian law\nThere are no Australian Federal Laws for surveillance and GPS tracker legality.\nHowever, most states have statutes covering the use and restrictions of tracking devices used for surveillance.\n\nThe below states have formal statutes. At present, only Queensland and Tasmania do not have legislation.\n\nUnited States law\nIn the United States, the use of GPS trackers by government authorities is limited by the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution. So police, for example, usually require a search warrant. While police have placed GPS trackers in vehicles without a warrant, this usage was questioned in court in early 2009.\n\nUse by private citizens is regulated in some states, such as California, where California Penal Code Section 637.7 states: \n(a) No person or entity in this state shall use an electronic tracking device to determine the location or movement of a person. \n(b) This section shall not apply when the registered owner, lesser, or lessee of a vehicle has consented to the use of the electronic tracking device with respect to that vehicle.\n(c) This section shall not apply to the lawful use of an electronic tracking device by a law enforcement agency.\n(d) As used in this section, \"electronic tracking device\" means any device attached to a vehicle or other movable thing that reveals its location or movement by transmission of electronic signals.\n(g) A violation of this section is a misdemeanor.\n(f) A violation of this section by a person, business, firm, company, association, partnership, or corporation licensed under Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Business and Professions Code shall constitute grounds for revocation of the license issued to that person, business, firm, company, association, partnership, or corporation, pursuant to the provisions that provide for the revocation of the license as set forth in Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Business and Professions Code.\n\nNote that 637.7 pertains to all electronic tracking devices, and does not differentiate between those that rely on GPS technology or not. As the laws catch up with the times, it is plausible that all 50 states will eventually enact laws similar to those of California. \n\nOther laws, like the common law invasion of privacy tort as well as state criminal wiretapping statutes (for example, the wiretapping statute of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which is extremely restrictive) potentially cover the use of GPS tracking devices by private citizens without consent of the individual being so tracked. Privacy can also be a problem when people use the devices to track the activities of a loved one. GPS tracking devices have also been put on religious statues to track the whereabouts of the statue if stolen.\n\nIn 2009, debate ensued over a Georgia proposal to outlaw hidden GPS tracking, with an exception for law enforcement officers but not for private investigators. See Georgia HB 16 - Electronic tracking device; location of person without consent (2009).\n\nUnited Kingdom law\nThe law in the UK has not specifically addressed the use of GPS trackers, but several laws may affect the use of this technology as a surveillance tool.\n\nData Protection Act 1998\n\nIt is quite clear that if client instructions (written or digitally transmitted) that identify a person and a vehicle are combined with a tracker, the information gathered by the tracker becomes personal data as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998. The document “What is personal data? – A quick reference guide” published by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) makes clear that data identifying a living individual is personal data. If a living individual can be identified from the data, with or without additional information that may become available, is personal data.\n\nIdentifiability\n\nAn individual is 'identified' if distinguished from other members of a group. In most cases, an individual's name, together with some other information, will be sufficient to identify them, but a person can be identified even if their name is not known. Start by looking at the means available to identify an individual and the extent to which such means are readily available to you.\n\nDoes the data 'relate to' the identifiable living individual, whether in personal or family life, business or profession?\n\nRelates to means: Data which identifies an individual, even without an associated name, may be personal data which is processed to learn or record something about that individual, or the processing of information that affects the individual. Therefore, data may 'relate to' an individual in several different ways.\n\nIs the data 'obviously about a particular individual? \n\nData 'obviously about' an individual will include their medical history, criminal record, record of work, or their achievements in a sporting activity. Data that is not 'obviously about' a particular individual may include information about their activities. Data such as personal bank statements or itemised telephone bills will be personal data about the individual operating the account or contracting for telephone services. Where data is not 'obviously about' an identifiable individual it may be helpful to consider whether the data is being processed, or could easily be processed, to learn, record or decide something about an identifiable individual. Information may be personal data where the aim, or an incidental consequence, of the processing, is that one learns or records something about an identifiable individual, or the processing could affect an identifiable individual. Data from a Tracker would be to identify the individual or their activities. It is therefore personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nAny individual who wishes to gather personal data must be registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and have a DPA number. It is a criminal offense to process data and not have a DPA number.\n\nTrespass\n\nIt may be a civil trespass for an individual to deploy a tracker on another's car. But in the OSC's annual inspection, the OSC's Chief Surveillance Commissioner Sir Christopher Rose stated \"putting an arm into a wheel arch or under the frame of a vehicle is straining the concept of trespass\".\n\nHowever, entering a person's private land to deploy a tracker is clearly a trespass which is a civil tort.\n\nPrevention of Harassment Act 1997\n\nAt times, the public misinterprets surveillance, in all its forms, as stalking. Whilst there is no specific legislation to address this kind of harassment, a long-term pattern of persistent and repeated efforts at contact with a particular victim is generally considered stalking.\n\nThe Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 created two new offenses of stalking by inserting new sections 2A and 4A into the PHA 1997. The new offences which came into force on 25 November 2012, are not retrospective. Section 2A (3) of the PHA 1997 sets out examples of acts or omissions which, in particular circumstances, are ones associated with stalking. Examples are: following a person, watching or spying on them, or forcing contact with the victim through any means, including social media.\n\nSuch behavior curtails a victim's freedom, leaving them feeling that they constantly have to be careful. In many cases, the conduct might appear innocent (if considered in isolation), but when carried out repeatedly, so as to amount to a course of conduct, it may then cause significant alarm, harassment or distress to the victim.\n\nThe examples given in section 2A (3) are not an exhaustive list but an indication of the types of behavior that may be displayed in a stalking offense.\n\nStalking and harassment of another or others can include a range of offenses such as those under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the Offences Against the Person Act 1861; the Sexual Offences Act 2003; and the Malicious Communications Act 1988.\n\nExamples of the types of conduct often associated with stalking include direct communication; physical following; indirect contact through friends, colleagues, family or technology; or, other intrusions into the victim's privacy. The behavior curtails a victim's freedom, leaving them feeling that they constantly have to be careful.\n\nIf the subject of inquiry is aware of the tracking, then this may amount to harassment under the Prevention of Harassment Act 1997. There is a case at the Royal Courts of Justice where a private investigator is being sued under this act for the use of trackers. In December 2011, a Claim was brought against Richmond Day & Wilson Limited (First Defendant) and Bernard Matthews Limited (Second Defendant), Britain's leading Turkey Provider.\n\nThe case relates to the discovery of a tracking device found in August 2011 on a vehicle supposedly connected to Hillside Animal Sanctuary.\n\nRegulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000\n\nProperty Interference: The Home Office published a document entitled \"Covert Surveillance and Property Interference, Revised Code of Practice, Pursuant to section 71 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000\"  where it suggests in Chapter 7, page 61 that;\n\nGeneral basis for lawful activity\n\n7. 1 Authorizations under section 5 of the 1994 Act or Part III of the 1997 Act should be sought wherever members of the intelligence services, the police, the services police, Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or Office of Fair Trading (OFT), or persons acting on their behalf, conduct entry on, or interference with, property or with wireless telegraphy that would be otherwise unlawful.\n\n7. 2 For the purposes of this chapter, \"property interference\" shall be taken to include entry on, or interference with, property or with wireless telegraphy.\n\nExample: The use of a surveillance device for providing information about the location of a vehicle may involve some physical interference with that vehicle as well as subsequent directed surveillance activity. Such an operation could be authorized by a combined authorization for property interference (under Part III of the 1997 Act) and, where appropriate, directed surveillance (under the 2000 Act). In this case, the necessity and proportionality of the property interference element of the authorization would need to be considered by the appropriate authorizing officer separately to the necessity and proportionality of obtaining private information by means of the directed surveillance.\n\nThis can be interpreted to mean that placing a tracker on a vehicle without the consent of the owner is illegal unless you obtain authorization from the Surveillance Commissionaire under the RIPA 2000 laws. Since a member of the public cannot obtain such authorizations, it is therefore illegal property interference.\n\nAnother interpretation is that it is illegal to do so if you are acting under the instruction of a public authority and you do not obtain authorization. The legislation makes no mention of property interference for anyone else.\n\nCurrently, there is no legislation in place that deals with the deployment of trackers in a criminal sense except RIPA 2000 and that RIPA 2000 only applies to those agencies and persons mentioned in it.\n\nUses in marketing\n\nIn August 2010, Brazilian company Unilever ran an unusual promotion where GPS trackers were placed in boxes of Omo laundry detergent. Teams would then track consumers who purchased the boxes of detergent to their homes where they would be awarded a prize for their purchase. The company also launched a website (in Portuguese) to show the approximate location of the winners' homes.\n\nSee also\n\n Automatic Packet Reporting System\n Data privacy\n Electronic tagging\n GPS aircraft tracking\n GPS navigation device\n GPS tracking server\n GPS watch\n GPS wildlife tracking\n Intelligent transportation system (ITS)\n IVMS\n Mobile phone\n Radio clock#GPS clocks\n Real-time locating\n Telematics\n Telematics 2.0\n Vehicle infrastructure integration\n Vehicle tracking system\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGlobal Positioning System\nSurveillance\nGeopositioning\nNavigational equipment\n\nde:Track Log\nfr:Géolocalisation"}
{"id": "4105328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane%20Helene%20%281958%29", "title": "Hurricane Helene (1958)", "text": "Hurricane Helene was the most intense tropical cyclone of the 1958 Atlantic hurricane season. The eighth tropical storm and fourth hurricane of the year, Helene was formed from a tropical wave east of the Lesser Antilles on September 21, 1958. Moving steadily westward, the storm slowly intensified, attaining hurricane strength on September 24. As conditions became increasingly favorable for tropical cyclone development, Helene began to rapidly intensify. Nearing the United States East Coast, the hurricane quickly attained Category 4 intensity on September 26, before it subsequently reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of  and a minimum barometric pressure of . The intense hurricane came within  of Cape Fear, North Carolina before recurving out to sea. Accelerating northward, Helene gradually weakened, and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it passed over Newfoundland on September 29. Helene's extratropical remnants traversed eastwards across the Atlantic Ocean before dissipating near Great Britain on October 4.\n\nDespite not making landfall on North Carolina, its close proximity to land caused extensive damage across the US East Coast. Strong winds resulted in widespread power outages, cutting telecommunications along the coast. A weather station in Wilmington, North Carolina reported a wind gust of , setting a new record for fastest wind gust reported there. Though mostly concentrated in North Carolina, rainfall was widespread, reaching as far north as Maine. In the United States, damages reached $11.2 million and there was one indirect death. After impacting the US, Helene produced strong winds and heavy rain across much of Atlantic Canada. In Cape Breton Island on Nova Scotia, the storm was considered the worst in at least 21 years. Power outages cut most communications from the island to the mainland, and property damage in Sydney, Nova Scotia totaled to C$100,000. At Helene's landfall in Newfoundland, strong gusts peaking at  in Naval Station Argentia were reported, and loss of power severed communications. Damage across there totaled to at least C$100,000. Total damages associated with Helene in the United States and Canada amounted to $11.4 million, making Helene the costliest storm of the season.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nThe origins of Hurricane Helene can be traced back to an easterly wave that formed near Cape Verde on September 16. Moving towards the west due to trade winds associated with the Hadley cell, the disturbance gradually intensified. On September 20, ships in the system's vicinity reported widespread shower activity and generally low barometric pressures. Early the following day, a reconnaissance flight reported evidence of a weak circulation, with gusts of  in heavy squalls surrounding the circulation center. At 0200 UTC later that day, the United States Weather Bureau office in San Juan, Puerto Rico began issuing bulletins on the system for public interests. In HURDAT, the tropical wave was first classified as a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on September 21, well east of the Leeward Antilles. At the time, the depression had maximum sustained winds of .\n\nMoving on a west-northwest track at roughly  early on September 22, the storm initially changed little in intensity. However, a large upper tropospheric anticyclone developed over the southern Atlantic coast, producing the favorable wind shear needed for tropical cyclone development. A second reconnaissance flight reported an intensified tropical cyclone, indicating that the storm system had reached tropical storm strength. At 0000 UTC on September 23, the depression attained tropical storm strength, with maximum winds of  and a central minimum pressure of . The US Weather Bureau issued their first advisory on the newly developed tropical storm at 1600 UTC later that day, giving the storm the name Helene. Despite the storm's poor organization, Helene gradually intensified in favorable conditions generated by the large anticyclone. Throughout the day, a second anticyclone moved eastward until it was situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, while a mean trough in the lower levels of the atmosphere became situated over the United States East Coast. This would set up a path for Helene to pass very close to the United States. The tropical storm attained hurricane intensity by 2200 UTC on 2200 UTC on September 24, while located  east of Fort Pierce, Florida. However, in post-season analysis, it was found that Helene reached hurricane intensity earlier that day, by 1200 UTC. At the time, gale-force winds extended up to  out from the storm's center of circulation.\n\nThe hurricane steadily strengthened as it moved towards the northwest around the western periphery of the Azores High on September 25. Encountering the anticyclone situated off of the Mid-Atlantic states, Helene began to curve slightly towards the west. The lack of strong steering currents in the storm's vicinity caused the hurricane to move very slowly throughout the day, giving the hurricane time to significantly intensify. By 0000 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to the equivalent of a modern-day Category 2 hurricane, with a minimum pressure of . Moving slowly towards The Carolinas, the hurricane rapidly intensified. A recon flight reported a minimum pressure of , a drop of  from the previous day. As the hurricane neared the coast, its eye became apparent on coastal long-range WSR-57 weather radar images. By 1800 UTC on September 26, Helene strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane and then to a Category 4 hurricane the following day. The major hurricane continued to strengthen before reaching its peak intensity on September 27 with winds of . However, Helene's lowest barometric pressure of  was recorded earlier during the day. Still moving northwestward due to the influence of the Azores High, the hurricane came within  of the US East Coast before recurving towards the northeast out to sea.\n\nAs Helene recurved and accelerated towards more northerly latitudes, it steadily weakened. By 1200 UTC on September 28, Helene was no longer a major hurricane. The hurricane's wind field also expanded from the storm's center as it weakened. By midday on September 29, Helene had weakened to minimal hurricane strength, and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 1800 UTC that day, though it still maintained hurricane-force winds. At roughly the same time, Helene passed over Newfoundland, with gale-force winds having expanded  from the system's center, coinciding with the US Weather Bureau's final advisory on the system. Helene's extratropical remnants continued eastward across the Atlantic, becoming a dominant synoptic feature, before entirely dissipating by 0600 UTC on October 4 just west of Great Britain.\n\nPreparations\n\nUpon the storm's formation, the Weather Bureau cautioned ships in Helene's path of the impending conditions, and did so throughout the storm's duration. As the storm moved west on September 23, advisories specified for small craft in northern islands of The Bahamas to remain in \"protected places.\" After Helene was forecast to remain north of the archipelago, notifications were lifted except for small craft along the coast of the South Atlantic States. Nearing the US East Coast, the Weather Bureau began to issue special bulletins for press radio and television stations early on September 24. At the same time, small craft were warned of the storm from The Carolinas southward. The following day, the weather forecast office (WFO) in Charleston, South Carolina began to issue local statements regarding the hurricane, while small craft alerts were shifted northward to coastal regions between Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and Daytona Beach, Florida. The first hurricane watch was issued on 1000 UTC on September 26 for the entirety of the Georgian coast to Charleston, South Carolina. A gale warning was posted at the same time for coastal areas from Daytona Beach, Florida to Wilmington, North Carolina. Small craft alerts continued to shift northwards along with Helene.\n\nAs the storm began to quickly intensify on September 26, areas of the watch from Savannah, Georgia to Cape Fear, North Carolina were upgraded to a hurricane emergency area at 1600 UTC. Affected communities were advised to begin precautionary measures immediately and evacuate. Shipping and small craft were told to exercise \"extreme caution.\" Gale warnings were changed to warn areas between Fernandina, Florida to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The heightened warnings caused WFOs to issue local bulletins regarding the impending hurricane. At the time, the Weather Bureau projected Helene to make landfall in South Carolina. These landfall forecasts shifted further north along the coast over time, before they were stopped after Helene recurved away from the coast entirely. At 0400 UTC on September 27, hurricane warnings were extended to include areas between Cape Fear and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Gale warning issuance reflected the changes and were too shifted northwards to the Virginia Capes area, while hurricane watches covered both warning areas. At 1600 UTC later that day, hurricane emergency and gale warnings were extended north to Manteo, North Carolina, while hurricane watches were continued for coastal regions from Savannah, Georgia to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. After Helene began recurving away from the coast, all warnings south of Wilmington, North Carolina were discontinued at 2200 UTC on September 27. As Helene passed certain areas, warnings were discontinued upon the storm's passage. At 1000 UTC the next day, all onshore hurricane warnings were either downgraded to gale warnings or discontinued. However, offshore gale warnings were still issued for oceanic regions from the Virginia Capes to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Shortly after, all warnings, with the exception of the offshore gale warnings, were discontinued. Remaining warnings lasted until 2200 UTC on September 28. Despite not issuing any warnings, the Weather Bureau cautioned interests in Newfoundland, and forecasted hurricane-force winds to effect the island.\n\nDue to the potential impacts from Helene, the Weather Bureau began to advise prompt emergency evacuation in their advisories. Areas between Beaufort, South Carolina and Cape Fear, North Carolina were urged to begin evacuation procedures immediately. The Southeastern American Red Cross sent ten field staff warnings to locations in Georgia and South Carolina in order to assist in setting up emergency shelters. The Red Cross held 27 hurricane preparation conferences to plan preparation procedures. Other civil defense organizations also mobilized hurricane preparation staff and equipment. The Weather Bureau sent a mobile weather station to Charleston, South Carolina in order to monitor weather conditions and alert surrounding populations with short-range radio equipment. Beaches on North Carolina's coast, including Wrightsville Beach and Carolina Beach, were completely evacuated during the night of September 27. In Wilmington, North Carolina, 100 members of the United States National Guard were dispatched to monitor waterfront property, while 60 others were kept on standby. Civilian vehicles attempting to enter Myrtle Beach, South Carolina were sent back by highway patrol  outside the city borders, following an order issued by Governor of South Carolina George Bell Timmerman, Jr. The order was issued to minimize casualties and prevent looting. Approximately 100 members of the National Guard and local police were kept to patrol the beach. Despite repeated orders for mandatory evacuation, a few people remained in Myrtle Beach. Civil Defense authorities forcibly evacuated stragglers, but others were permitted to remain.\n\nImpact and aftermath\n\nUnited States East Coast\n\nDespite not making landfall, Helene's close proximity to the United States resulted in impacts along the East Coast. Impacts were most severe in North Carolina, where the hurricane made its closest approach. Wind impacts were felt primarily from South Carolina to Virginia, though a frontal zone aided in bringing precipitation as far north as Maine. In the United States, Helene caused $11.2 million in damages and one indirect fatality.\n\nNorth Carolina\nRoughly paralleling the North Carolina coast beginning on September 26, Helene's slow movement and strong intensity resulted in moderate to heavy impacts in coastal areas of the state. Despite the hurricane's Category 4 hurricane intensity, due to its closest approach to land remaining offshore, its storm surge remained less than initially forecast. The hurricane's track also placed its strongest storm surge in the eastern hemisphere of the storm, away from any landmasses. Surge heights peaked at  near Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. In Wilmington, Helene produced ocean swells at the coast 2.5 – 3 times per minute, indicative of a strong hurricane. There, the cumulative sea level was roughly  above normal. However, as a result of the storm striking at low tide, damage caused by storm surge was mostly mitigated. Despite this, sand dunes in southern areas of Fort Fisher, were mostly destroyed by waves. On Cedar Island, strong winds produced by the hurricane pushed waves inland, inundating homes. Elsewhere, minor beach erosion occurred.\n\nFurther inland, several weather stations reported hurricane-force winds. The Weather Bureau office in Wilmington, North Carolina, reported maximum sustained winds of  and a peak gust of , exceeding the previous record for fastest measured wind speed of  set during Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Beach resorts there were heavily damaged. In Wrightsville Beach, located  of Wilmington, 12 houses were flattened by the hurricane. Damage to homes there were estimated by police to cost $300,000, and extensive damage to the water system was reported. In Long Beach, damage was less severe, with only minor property damage. Waves pushing past sand dunes caused cracks in seaside roads. Though surveys made no damage estimates, damage in Holden Beach was reported to have been worse than in Long Beach. A  pier and a pavilion in Ocean Isle Beach were destroyed. In Topsail Beach and Kure Beach, several homes and businesses were either unroofed or destroyed. Yaupon Beach and Shallotte also had similar reports of unroofed homes. Two homes on Topsail Island were demolished, and extensive property damage was reported in Atlantic Beach. At Cape Fear, winds were estimated at , with gusts as high as , well into Category 3 intensity. The powerful winds forced power to be cut off in Wilmington as a precautionary measure. As a result, 7,000 telephones were knocked out of service. Damage to the Southern Bell Telephone Company's offices cost $150,000. Total damages in the city was estimated to cost nearly $2 million. In Morehead City, a roof was blown from a yacht shed and multiple structures. Long-distance telephone services were also cut off. Off the coast on Ocracoke Island, power and communications failed during the storm after the island was battered by winds of . Power outages were commonplace in other areas as well. In Southport, metal debris was scattered across city streets, and the damage there was described as worse than Hurricane Hazel. Half of its pier was swept away by the rough seas, and other buildings collapsed or sustained heavy damage. Numerous trees, including live oak, were uprooted by the winds. The United States Army provided the port with a temporary electrical generator, which provided power for water pumps and light. In Cape Hatteras, Helene caused an estimated $1 million in damages. Although damage to infrastructure tapered off  from the coast, crop damage was observed  inland. Corn was the crop most affected by Helene.\n\nRainfall associated with Helene was primarily concentrated in coastal regions North Carolina, peaking at  in Wilmington International Airport. In Hatteras,  of rain was measured. Rainfall totals of at least  were commonplace elsewhere along the North Carolina coast. An indirect death occurred when a car skidded off a flooded highway, killing the driver. In the state, damages from Helene amounted to $11 million.\n\nSouth Carolina\nEffects from Helene in South Carolina were less severe than in North Carolina. Helene made its closest approach to the state on September 27, . In Charleston, sustained winds reached  and there was minor damage reported Trees and street signs were blown down, and beach houses suffered shingle damage. Sporadic and small power outages occurred throughout the city. Damage became progressively worse from Georgetown to Little River, with automobile accidents, torn roofs, and damaged piers. On Harbor Island, 50 percent of structure were reported to have roof damage, causing and estimated $125,000 in damages. Elsewhere along the South Carolina coast, beach erosion occurred due to the strong waves, and sections of pier were swept into sea. In Windy Hill and Cherry Grove Beach, three fishing piers were damaged. Damage was minor in Myrtle Beach, and was limited to roof and window damage. Further inland, in Columbia, damage was minimal, with no rainfall reported. Light damage to crops was reported inland, particularly in Marion County. Across the state, damages were estimated at $200,000 from the hurricane, though this did not include beach erosion or damage to sand dunes.\n\nElsewhere in the United States\nAs a result of Helene recurving away from the United States East Coast, damage in the United States outside of the Carolinas was less severe. In Virginia, damage was relatively minor. A peak gust of  was reported in Norfolk. In Hampton Roads, damage was minor, and was confined to downed utility wires and marginal infrastructural damage. Although rainfall was primarily concentrated in the Carolinas, 1,434 official rain gauges measured precipitation in coastal areas from South Carolina to Maine. Precipitation was further increased by a frontal zone to the hurricane's north. In the Mid-Atlantic States, rainfall peaked at  in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Outside of Pennsylvania or the Carolinas, no weather station reported rainfall exceeding . In the New England region, rainfall peaked at  in Hyannis, Massachusetts. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, rainfall totals ranging from  caused minor flooding and road washouts. The minor floods led to several automotive accidents. Other states in New England reported rainfall peaks of at least , with the lowest peak occurring at a weather station in Machias, Maine, which reported  of rainfall.\n\nAtlantic Canada\n\nAs Helene approached Atlantic Canada in the process of transitioning into an extratropical storm, it produced heavy rainfall and strong winds along the region. Passing just east of Nova Scotia on September 29, Helene dropped at least  across the entire province, peaking at  in Cape Breton Island. Gusts peaked at  across Cabot Strait,  at CFB Shearwater and  at Summerside, Prince Edward Island. The storm damaged power lines on the island but they were quickly repaired. The strong winds uprooted trees in the Halifax and Dartmouth, Nova Scotia area. In Nova Scotia, Helene's worst effects were felt in Cape Breton Island, where the storm was considered the worst in at least 21 years. Only one communication line from the island to the mainland was effective after the storm passed. Numerous downed power lines resulted in minor fires, and schools were closed throughout the island. In Sydney, Nova Scotia, there was considerable property damage, and as many as 700 people lost power. The lack of sufficient electricity forced the suspension of publications of the Cape Breton Post and disrupted normal restaurant cooking procedures. Damages in the community amounted to C$100,000. Offshore, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cutter Fort Walsh, measuring  in length, was washed ashore on the coast of Scatarie Island. The fishing wharf in Caribou, Nova Scotia was destroyed by rough seas generated by Helene, and at least 1,000 lobster traps were carried into the Northumberland Strait as a result. In New Brunswick, the hurricane's impacts were relatively minor, and rainfall peaked at .\n\nQuickly accelerating northwards, Helene made landfall on Newfoundland late on September 29. Rainfall peaked at  in northern parts of the island, while rainfall amounts were generally minimal across the Avalon Peninsula. A weather station in Naval Station Argentia reported maximum sustained winds of  and a gust of . The winds severed communications in southwestern Newfoundland and cut communications in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador from the mainland. Bell Island was cut off from the rest of Newfoundland due to rough seas generated by Helene, which resulted in the destruction of piers and lack of boat service. Damage caused by the hurricane on the island were estimated to be in excess of C$100,000.\n\nAftermath\nFollowing the storm, Governor of North Carolina Luther H. Hodges and United States Senator from North Carolina B. Everett Jordan requested a disaster declaration for the state. President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower designated portions of North Carolina impacted by the storm as a disaster area. According to the American Red Cross, at least 5,000 people were kept in shelters after Helene. Following the large-scale evacuation procedures and resulting low loss of life after the storm, the Weather Bureau recommended that certain organizations be awarded the Outstanding Service to the Public certificate due to their cooperation with the Weather Bureau during the hurricane's duration. The recommended recipients were the radio stations WPTF and WRAL, and the North Carolina State Highway Patrol.\n\nSee also \n\n Other storms of the same name\n List of North Carolina hurricanes\n Hurricane Able (1950)\n Hurricane Diana (1984)\n Hurricane Florence\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\nNational Hurricane Center Hurricane Helene \"Storm Wallet\" Archive\nMovie of a Helene reconnaissance flight\n\nHelene\nHelene (1958)\nHelene (1958)\nHurricanes in Canada\n1958 natural disasters in the United States"}

Cury (born November 6, 1928 in Allentown, Pennsylvania – January 11, 1977) was the owner of the Mandarin Super Market and a resident of Mandarin, Florida.  He was known as the founder of POWER, an advocacy group on utility rates, and as an opponent of the Dames Point Bridge and nuclear power plants.\n\nFounding of POWER\nCury received an electrical bill from the Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) which was double the cost of the month before. He called the company to inquire and they said it was because of the high cost of oil. Cury then founded People Outraged With Electric Rates (POWER), a local advocacy group. The treasurer was Harry Shorstein, former State Attorney for the city of Jacksonville, Florida. Ralph Nader became involved with the protests for a short time. Inspired by Nader's brief involvement, Cury changed P.O.W.E.R. to Consumer P.O.W.E.R.\n\nCury strongly opposed the construction of the Dames Point Bridge, and was a vocal leader of the opposition to the project. He was also opposed to the movement to bring an Offshore Power Systems (O.P.S.) assembly facility to the Jacksonville area. In 1975, Cury considered running for mayor of Jacksonville and realizing that he would have to borrow too much money, he considered city council instead. He received a letter threatening to reveal his conspiracy to robbery conviction from Pennsylvania. Cury had been convicted of the attempted theft of $1200.00 (the equivalent of approximately \n$13,000 with inflation) and reported the letter to the authorities, where it was found to contain only the fingerprints of Cury and the investigating officer.Dudley Clendenin, St. Petersburg Times, July 1976. Cury was also part of the opposition of the Dames Point Bridge movement. His main opposition in this project was Wesley Paxson, the chairman of the Jacksonville Transportation Authority (JTA). He was also opposed by George Truett Ewton, the chairman of the JEA. At his store, he sold a copy of Ralph Nader's newsletter, Critical Mass''.\n\nOpposing nuclear power plants\nCury opposed the Offshore Power Systems (OPS) project, a 1970 joint venture between Westinghouse Electric Company, which constructed nuclear generating plants, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock, which had recently merged with Tenneco, to create floating nuclear power plants at Jacksonville, Florida. Opposition to the project was both local and national because many people questioned the safety of nuclear power.\n\nOPS ultimately was not successful due to the 1973 oil crisis. By the end of the embargo in March 1974, the price of oil had risen nearly 300%, from US$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally; US prices were significantly higher. The embargo caused an oil crisis, or \"shock\", with many short- and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy. Less oil available resulted in higher oil prices, which encouraged conservation and less demand for electricity. PSE&G did not need the additional capacity from the nuclear generators they had ordered, so PSE&G requested a two-year delay, culminating in a canceled contract. Cury became known to the community through his public interest work and was frequently in the local press. After his death, the local Southside Business Men's Club awarded him their Outspoken Citizens Award.\n\nDeath\nHe died from heart disease in 1977 at age 48.\n\nPersonal life\nJoseph and his wife Betty had two children, Charles (deceased) and Pamela.\n\nReferences\n\n1928 births\n1977 deaths\nAmerican grocers\nBusinesspeople from Florida\nUnited States Marines\nAmerican anti–nuclear power activists\n20th-century American businesspeople"}

It measures  × . The work is now in the collection of the Kunsthalle Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. It was the first work of pop art to achieve iconic status.\n\nHistory\nJust what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? was created in 1956 for the catalogue of the exhibition This Is Tomorrow in London, England in which it was reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit. Hamilton and his friends John McHale and John Voelcker had collaborated to create the room that became the best-known part of the exhibition.\n\nHamilton subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring the female bodybuilder Bernie Price which he produced using a Quantel Paintbox.\n\nSources\n\nAccording to a 2007 article by the art historian John-Paul Stonard, the collage consists of images taken mainly from American magazines. The principal template was an image of a modern sitting-room in an advertisement in Ladies' Home Journal for Armstrong Floors, which describes the \"modern fashion in floors\". The title is also taken from copy in the advert, which states \"Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing? Open planning of course—and a bold use of color.\" The body builder is Irvin \"Zabo\" Koszewski, winner of Mr L.A. in 1954. The photograph is taken from Tomorrow's Man magazine, September 1954. The artist Jo Baer, who posed for erotic magazines in her youth, has claimed that she is the burlesque woman on the sofa, but the magazine from which the picture is taken has not been identified. The staircase is taken from an advertisement for Hoover's new model \"Constellation\", and it was sourced from the same issue of Ladies' Home Journal, June 1955, as the Armstrong Floors ad. The picture of artist Jack Kirby's cover of Young Romance was from an advertisement for the magazine included in its associated publication Young Love (no 15, 1950). The TV is a Stromberg-Carlson, taken from a 1955 advert. Hamilton asserted that the rug was a blow-up from a photograph depicting a crowd on the Whitley Bay beach. The image of planet Earth at the top was cut from Life magazine (Sept 1955). The original reference image for the collage from Life magazine supplied to Hamilton is in the John McHale archives at Yale University. It was one of the first images to be laid down in the collage. The Victorian man in the portrait has not been identified. The periodical on the chair is a copy of The Journal of Commerce, founded by telegraph pioneer Samuel F. B. Morse. The tape recorder is a British-made Boosey & Hawkes \"Reporter\", but the source of the image has not been identified. The view through the window is a widely reproduced photograph of the exterior of a cinema in 1927 showing the premiere of the early \"talkie\" film, The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson; the actual original source of the image has not yet been found.\n\nAuthorship\nIn 2006, artist John McHale's son, John McHale Jr., said that his father claimed he was the creator of the image, having provided the original measured design and iconic material for the collage, including the magazines from which much of the collage was assembled. McHale said that the source material was his, sent to Hamilton from Yale University, where McHale was studying, and that Hamilton's role was simply \"mechanical\" cutting out and pasting according to McHale's design.\n\nIn response, Hamilton said this was \"absurd. The collage has been widely reproduced over the last fifty years and my authorship was never, to my knowledge, contested by John McHale Sr. when he was alive.\" Hamilton said that McHale provided him with a rough layout for six pages for the This is Tomorrow exhibition catalogue, but he only used two of them, and the other pages, including this collage, were created by himself; the American magazines that provided the images were from the collection of Magda and Frank Cordell, and the images were cut out by Hamilton's wife, Terry O'Reilly, and Magda Cordell.\n\nMagda Cordell has said that \"While Richard, of course, put together the well-known poster collage for the group (Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?), some of the material in that collage came from John McHale's files, and both Terry Hamilton and I helped gather the images. We often looked for material in the studio John and I shared. Sometimes when I look at that poster, I think it looks a bit like the sitting room in Cleveland Square where our studio was, but this may be only my imagination\".\n\nReferences in popular culture\nIn 2007, the Serbian and former Yugoslav new wave band VIS Idoli released a career spanning box set featuring the image as a basis for the box set cover.\n\nNotes and references\n\n1956 works\nCollage\nEnglish art\nPop art\nBritish art"}

Brandeis harshly criticized investment bankers who controlled large amounts of money deposited in their banks by middle-class people. The heads of these banks, Brandeis pointed out, routinely sat on the boards of railroad companies and large industrial manufacturers of various products, and routinely directed the resources of their banks to promote the interests of their own companies. These companies, in turn, sought to maintain control of their industries by crushing small businesses and stamping out innovators who developed better products to compete against them. \n\nBrandeis supported his contentions with a discussion of the actual dollar amounts—in millions of dollars—controlled by specific banks, industries, and industrialists such as J. P. Morgan, noting that these interests had recently acquired a far larger proportion of American wealth than corporate entities had ever had before. He extensively cited testimony from a Congressional investigation performed by the Pujo Committee, named after Louisiana Representative Arsène Pujo, into self-serving and monopolistic business dealing.\n\nFamous quote\nChapter V of the book (\"What Publicity Can Do\") contains in its opening section a well-known line that has frequently been cited in support of regulation through disclosure obligations: \"Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.\"\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\n US corporate law\n\nExternal links\n\n\"The Value of Other People's Money\" in the New York Times\n\n1914 non-fiction books\nBanking controversies\nFinance books\nWorks by Louis Brandeis\nCriticisms of companies\nEssay collections"}

It was abolished at the January 2015 NUTS 3 revision. Its 15 municipalities occupied an area of  in the north-east of continental Portugal with an estimated 2008 population of 214,460 inhabitants; thus it constituted approximately 40% of the area, but only 6.1% of the population, of the Norte Region.\n\nGeography\nThe Trás-os-Montes area refers to a contiguous territory that has similar social and cultural identities, but diverges on the potential economic abilities, while constituting a territorial unit with scale and critical mass to act in concert politically. In addition to its land border with Spain (in the north and north-northeast), it is also juxtapositioned with the subregions of the Douro (to the south), Tâmega Subregion (in the southwest), Ave (in the southwest) and Cávado (in the west). The NUTS III region of Alto Trás-os-Montes includes the following municipalities:\n Alfândega da Fé - a Moorish enclave, it was conquered by Asturian Christians and its original name, Alfandagh (which means hospice), was extended with Fe (meaning faith). The beginnings of its municipal history date back to a foral established on 8 May 1294, by King Denis of Portugal;\n Boticas - its history dates back to the Guedeões-Barroso line of hereditary clans (the Barrosos, were the predominant line, fixing themselves in Braga and Barcelos) becoming signeurs and administrators of the lands of the Trás-os-Montes until the lands were donated. The municipality was established during the Liberal regime (6 November 1836 decree) from portions of Chaves and Montalegre;\n Bragança - home to the hereditary line of the House of Braganza, established in 1442 by King Afonso, responsible for providing Portugal its kings (from 1640 to 1910) and the emperors (from 1822 to 1889): at the end of the Iberian Union with Spain, after the 1 December 1640, that the ascension of the 8th Duke of Braganza (then military governor of Portugal), John IV to the title of King that restored the Portuguese monarchy;\n Chaves – founded during the reign of the Flavian Emperor Vespasian, Aquae Flaviae, was renowned during this period for its thermal springs and baths. During the Middle Ages it was traded back and forth between Spanish and Portuguese monarchs, as well as the seat of Monarchy of the North, during the failed monarchist revolts of the 20th century;\n Macedo de Cavaleiros – named in honour of Martim Gonçalves de Macedo, who saved John, the Master of Aviz during the Battle of Aljubarrota, the municipality is best known for the Paisagem Protegida da Albufeira do Azibo a reservoir constructed during the 1980s to support the communities, but used for both recreational and leisure activities.\n Miranda do Douro\n Mirandela\n Mogadouro\n Montalegre\n Murça\n Valpaços\n Vila Pouca de Aguiar\n Vimioso\n Vinhais\n\nThe inhabitants are not homogeneously distributed within the region: with most of the population concentrated in the principal urban agglomerations, the region has experienced a continuous process of rural-to-urban population migration to centres within or outside the region. Yet, simultaneously, the medium-to-small centres have taken on a catalytic role in urbanization and economic development.\n\nThe structure of the Trás-os-Montes hierarchy is highlighted by the largest of these \"medium\"-sized cities (Bragança, Mirandela and Chaves), corresponding to the principal urban poles, and articulated by a complementary urban network, constituted by the seats of the municipalities of Alfândega da Fé, Boticas, Macedo de Cavaleiros, Miranda do Douro, Mogadouro, Montalegre, Ribeira de Pena, Valpaços, Vila Flor, Vila Pouca de Aguiar, Vimioso and Vinhais.\n\nThe proximity of Trás-os-Montes with Spain has allowed a cross-cultural and cross-social partnership, that has helped to develop both social and economic projects.\n\nEconomy\n\nInstitutionally, the municipalities of the Trás-os-Montes are aggregated into three associations that plan and promote regional development tasks within the region: Associação de Municípios da Terra Fria do Nordeste Transmontano (which include Bragança, Miranda do Douro, Mogadouro, Vimioso and Vinhais), the Associação de Municípios da Terra Quente Transmontana (with Alfândega da Fé, Macedo de Cavaleiros, Mirandela and Vila Flor) and Associação de Municípios do Alto Tâmega (Boticas, Chaves, Montalegre, Ribeira de Pena, Valpaços and Vila Pouca de Aguiar). The municipality of Mogadouro falls within the Associação de Municípios do Douro Superior. The AMTF-NT assumes the largest part of regional development funding and organizational motivation.\n\nThe agro-forestry activities in the region are transitioning to socially or economically viable commerce sectors, with the emigration of more residents into the urban areas. Agriculture, with its base in the production of olive oil, the raising of cattle, and cultivation of fruit orchards, remains the primary source of income in this region.\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nSources\n \n\nFormer NUTS 3 statistical regions of Portugal"}
{"id": "4105384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harassment%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom", "title": "Harassment in the United Kingdom", "text": "Harassment is a topic which, in the past couple of decades, has been taken increasingly seriously in the United Kingdom, and has been the subject of a number of pieces of legislation.\n\nIntroduction\nRacial and sexual discrimination have been unlawful under the Race Relations Acts and the Equality Act 2010 (originally the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 which was repealed). Respectively, it is only comparatively recently that specific legislation has defined harassment specifically as unlawful.\n\nBecause of the rise recently in awareness of the issues involved in harassment, recent trends have shown significant rises in the number of people making claims of harassment at Employment Tribunals. If the complaint is serious, high damages may be awarded against the Employer, so it is important for the Employer to take seriously any allegation of harassment at an early stage and take steps to quickly resolve it.\n\nThere is also legislation in place to be able to deal with discrimination, and this legislation is distinct to that provided under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Race Relations Acts.\n\nDefinition\nUnder the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 - this statute makes harassment a crime and a civil wrong:\n\nSection 1(1): 'A course of conduct which amounts to harassment, and which the defendant knows or ought to know amounts to harassment is prohibited.'\n\n\"A person must not pursue a course of conduct\n '(a) which amounts to harassment of another, and\n (b) which he knows or ought to know amounts to harassment of the other.'\n'As for what the defendant 'ought to know', the test is whether a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think it amounts to harassment' - Section 1(1)(2). The defendant need not know that their conduct amounts to harassment of the other, so long as you ought to know that your course of conduct ought to amount to harassment of the other:\n\nPer Section 1(2) - 'the person whose course of conduct is in question ought to know that it amounts to [or involves] harassment of another if a reasonable person in possession of the same information would think the course of conduct amounted to harassment of the other.Harassment also occurs when, on the grounds of race, disability, sex, sexual orientation, belief or religion, an employer - or their agent such as another employee or a manager - engages in unwanted conduct which has the purpose or effect of violating an individual's dignity or creating an interrogating, degrading, hostile offensive or humiliating environment for the employee in question.  This is wide spectrum, and covers all types of harassment.\n\nSuch actions can be:\n\n Physical conduct;\n Verbal conduct; and\n Non-verbal conduct.\n\nIn addition, while the conduct must be unwanted by the recipient, it does not necessarily have to be that the harasser has a motive or an intention to harass. So it is still harassment even if the harasser does not know there is harm caused by their actions.\n\n Requirements for the Tort of Harassment \nWhilst under Section 2 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, states that harassment is a crime, the statute also provides a civil remedy, for actual or apprehended harassment under section 3(1).\n\n'In life one has to put up with a certain amount of annoyance', but 'To cross the boundary from the regrettable to the unacceptable, the gravity of the misconduct must be of an order which would sustain criminal liability under section 2.' Under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, Section 7(2) 'References to harassing a person include alarming the person or causing the person distress.'\n\n Elements \n\n Alarm or distress \n'As with any common English word, what amounts to harassment, alarm or distress in any given situation is a question of fact for the magistrates.'\n\nHowever, whilst it is 'evident that the 1997 Act created an offence of potentially enormous scope, 'Not any trivial act of harassment will do; there is a minimum level of alarm and distress which must be suffered in order to constitute harassment.' This has been specified in previous case law that mere alarm or distress might not be enough to result in the defendant being liable for harassment; the defendant's behaviour must be oppressive. Moreover, in the case of Haynes v Willoughby, harassment was described as a persistent and deliberate course of unreasonable and oppressive conduct, targeted at another person, calculated to cause 'alarm, fear and/or distress.'\n\nFurthermore, following Pill LJ's judgment: 'To harass as defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, Tenth Edition, is to \"torment by subjecting to constant interference or intimidation. The conduct must be unacceptable to a degree which would sustain criminal liability and also must be oppressive. Course of conduct \nThere 'must be a course of conduct, that is to say conduct on at least two occasions.' 'A single act of harassment will not amount to an offence.' Under Section 7(3): A course of conduct must involve-\n\n(a) 'In the case of conduct in relation to a single person, conduct on at least two occasions in relation to that person, or\n\n(b) in the case of conduct in relation to two or more persons, conduct on at least one occasion in relation to each of those persons.'\n\nSo, a single occasion is not enough. For example, in the case of R v Curtis where the defendant was in a volatile relationship with the claimant. The court 'required proof of a course of conduct,' and it was held the 'course of conduct [present here] amounted to harassment.'\n\n What about where the conduct is not targeted at the claimant? \nIt is not necessary that the victim themselves be the target:\n\n 'Liability is incurred where the defendant engaged in a course of conduct which they knew, or ought to have known, amounted to harassment. \n The conduct does not need to be targeted at the claimant, although it must be foreseeable that the claimant will suffer the harm.'\n\nFor example, in the case of Levi v Bates [2015], the defendant published the claimant's address and number, however, the wife of the claimant also suffered distress and alarm resultant of this. The court held that although the husband was the target of the harassment, the wife could also sue because it was foreseeable that she too would have been harassed by the defendant's conduct.\n\nEmployer's liability\nAn employer is liable, as is the case for many other acts, for the actions of their employees during the course of employment. Though it would be relatively easier to prove that a manager or supervisor to the recipient could be guilty of harassing \"during the course of employment\", it may require more proof if the harasser is in a subordinate position.\n\nEmployers can avoid liability for discriminatory harassment if they can prove that they took such steps that were reasonably practical to prevent harassment from occurring.\n\nHowever, employers cannot use this defence to a claim of harassment under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, under which they will have vicarious liability for the actions of their employees.\n\nLegislation\nThe United Kingdom has a \"rag bag of statutes\" relating to harassment.\n\nAdministration of Justice Act 1970\nSection 40 of the Administration of Justice Act 1970 creates the offence of harassing a contract debtor.\n\nProtection from Eviction Act 1977\nThe marginal note to section 1 of the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 refers to \"harassment of occupier\".\n\nPublic Order Act 1986\nSection 4A of the Public Order Act 1986, inserted by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, creates the offence of intentional harassment, alarm or distress.\n\nSection 5 creates the offence of harassment, alarm or distress.\n\nProtection from Harassment Act 1997\n\nThis Act was primarily created to provide protection against stalkers, but it has been used in other ways.\n\nUnder this Act, it is now an offence for a person to pursue a course of action which amounts to harassment of another individual, and that they know or ought to know amounts to harassment. Under this act the definition of harassment is behaviour which causes alarm or distress. This Act provides for a jail sentence of up to six months or a fine. There are also a variety of civil remedies that can be used including awarding of damages, and restraining orders backed by the power of arrest.\n\nThe introduction of this legislation considers 'emotional harm generally,' which was considered a 'radical change to the law.'\n\nEmployers have vicarious liability for harassment by their employees under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, (see Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust). For employees this may provide an easier route to compensation than claims based on discrimination legislation or personal injury claims for stress at work, as the elements of harassment are likely to be easier to prove, the statutory defence is not available to the employer, and it may be easier to establish a claim for compensation. Also as the claim can be made in the County Court costs are recoverable and legal aid is available.\n\nIn Scotland the Act works slightly differently:\n\n A jail term of up to five years in very serious cases can be imposed.\n Civil remedies include damages, interdict and non-harassment orders backed by powers of arrest.\n\n Defences \nUnder the Protection from Harassment Act ‘1(3) Subsection (1) [or (1A)] does not apply to a course of conduct if the person who pursued it shows—\n\n (a) that it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime\n (b) that it was pursued under any enactment or rule of law or to comply with any condition or requirement imposed by any person under an enactment, or \n (c) that in the particular circumstances the pursuit of the course of conduct was reasonable.'\n\nFor example, shown again in the case of Haynes v Willoughby where the defendant was making allegations against his former employer of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion and engaged in a six-year campaign, writing to the police of the Department of Trade and Industry, among others. However, after investigation there was found to be nothing behind the allegations. Yet, even after the police shared their conclusions the defendant continued to make allegations. This amounted to harassment, as there was no further rational basis to continue his 'investigations.' Hence, the defence under Section 1(3)(a) was not upheld:[13] It cannot be the case that the mere existence of a belief, however absurd, in the mind of the harasser that he is detecting or preventing a possibly non-existent crime, will justify him in persisting in a course of conduct which the law characterises as oppressive. Some control mechanism is required, even if it falls well short of requiring the alleged harasser to prove that his alleged purpose was objectively reasonable'.[15]''' ‘Before an alleged harasser can be said to have had the purpose of preventing or detecting crime, he must have sufficiently applied his mind to the matter. He must have thought rationally about the material suggesting the possibility of criminality and formed the view that the conduct said to constitute harassment was appropriate for the purpose of preventing or detecting it. If he has done these things, then he has the relevant purpose.’\n\n Damages \nSee the main article: Damages\n\nUnder Section 3(2), compensatory damages may be awarded for anxiety and financial loss resultant of the harassment. Harassment incurs liability for all direct losses, and not merely those which were reasonably foreseeable.\n\nPotential remedies also include an injunction and if that injunction is transgressed, the claimant may apply for an arrest warrant under Section 3(3). For example, in the case of Brand v Berki,'' the claimant made repeated serious criminal allegations against Russell Brand, the comedian. She had reported the matter to the police, who investigated and said there was no cause to answer. However, she continued with the allegations in the national press and on Twitter. Resultantly, an interim injunction was granted, pending trial.\n\nSee also\nUnited Kingdom employment equality law\nSexual harassment\nUnited Kingdom labour law\nWorkplace harassment\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMajrowski v Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Trust  \n \n Neighbours From Hell in Britain: Harassment from your Neighbour\nWeaver v.

In 1872 he received an appointment at the University of Kiel, where he remained until 1878 when he became director of the herbarium at the University of Berlin.  He died in Berlin on March 2, 1887, of leukaemia.\n\nEichler made important contributions to the study of the comparative structure of flowers (mainly on floral symmetry in his work Blütendiagramme). He wrote extensively on the Coniferae, Cycadaceae and other plant groups of Brazil.\n\nEichler System\nThe Eichler System divided the plant kingdom into non-floral plants (Cryptogamae) and floral plants (Phanerogamae). It was the first to accept the concept of evolution and therefore also the first to be considered phylogenetic. Moreover, Eichler was the first taxonomist to separate the Phanerogamae into Angiosperms and Gymnosperms and the former into Monocotyledonae and Dicotyledonae.\n\nThe Eichler system was the foundation for Adolf Engler's System and was widely accepted in Europe and other parts of the world.\n\nWorks\n \n Volume I: 1875\n Volume II: 1878 \n Syllabus der Vorlesungen über Phanerogamenkunde  Lipsius und Tischer, Kiel 1876.\n Subsequent editions published as Syllabus der Vorlesungen über specielle und medicinisch-pharmaceutische Botanik, 2nd ed. 1880, 3rd ed. 1883, 4th ed. 1886, 5th 1890\n \n \n \n\n Flora Brasiliensis (Flora of Brazil) editor after death of Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1868 until 1887,  succeeded by Ignatz Urban (Available online at Botanicus.org Website)\n Beiträge zur Morphologie und Systematik der Marantaceen (1884)\n Zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der Palmenblätter (1885)\n Caroli Frid.

The road's first few kilometres are notoriously dangerous as the road is a continuous decline towards the river Seine from the A13 autoroute to the RN 13.\n\nAfter crossing the RN 13, the RN 15 follows the Seine towards Vernon. The RN 15 straightens and leaves the river, passing the town of Gaillon. The road runs parallel to the A13 autoroute and passes through the Forêt de Louviers heading North and over the river at Pont-de-l'Arche onto the right bank of the Seine.\n\nThe road follows the river bank overlooked by surrounding cliffs including the Roches de Saint-Adrien. The road meets the Route nationale 14 and enters the capital of Normandy, Rouen.\n\nThe N15 heads Northwest from the city centre and towards Yvetot. It enters the town of Yvetot to continue westwards. The road passes near the town of Bolbec, passes the A29 autoroute, Harfleur and enters Le Havre, ending at the city town hall.\n\nHistory\nThe N 15 was numbered N 13BIS from the 1950s until the end of the 1970s reclassification scheme. The RN 13BIS replaced the RN 182 (between Bonnières-sur-Seine and Rouen) and the RN 14 (between Rouen and Le Havre).Until 1972, the RN 15 was going from Pontoise to Dieppe; this road has been changed in RD 915 except in the Eure where it is called RD 15BIS.In 2006, the RN 15 has also been changed in a départementale and is now numbered RD 6015 in the Eure and Seine-Maritime départements and D 915 in the Yvelines. Nowadays, the RN 15 is limited to the crossing of Rouen.\n\nReferences\n\n015\nTransport in Normandy"}

Pratibha Singh, representing INC, won the last Lok Sabha byelection in 2021 from Mandi following the death of Ram Swaroop Sharma who won in 2019 general Lok Sabha election.\n\nHistory \nMandi Parliamentary constituency already emerged as a hot bed of politics where not only the BJP and the Congress will fight for their prestige, but is the only seat in the state where the Left front has popped up a candidate.\nThe constituency then was named as Mandi - Mahasu was represented by Rani Amrit Kaur of the erstwhile Patiala state and Sh Gopi Ram Mandi during 1952–57. In the Lok Sabha elections that followed in 1957, the seat was represented by Raja Joginder Sen of the erstwhile Mandi state, who represented the seat till 1962. In the following elections that year Raja Lalit Sen of Sundarnagar or the erstwhile Suket State was elected. He repeated his victory in the 1967 elections.\n\nHowever, in period from 1977 to 1979, the constituency was represented by Ganga Singh who represented the Janata Party, which came to power at the centre immediately after the elections that followed the imposition of emergency in the country and the Congress, under Indira Gandhi was routed. He defeated Congress candidate Virbhadra Singh.\n\nThen came along the man, who called himself the son-of-the-soil, Sukh Ram. He switched from state politics to the Parliament and won comfortably in 1985. In the next election, however, it was again another blue-blooded royal, Maheshwar Singh, scion of the erstwhile Kullu state who drubbed the son-of-the-soil at the polls.\n\nBut Sukh Ram bounced back and won again in 1994, but was expelled from the Congress a couple of years later, following the reported recovery of large amounts of cash from his residence. To re-establish his political dominion Sukh Ram floated Himachal Vikas Congress and came back into politics with a bang – winning five Assembly seats in 1998 along with wresting Shimla (reserved) parliamentary seat from the Congress in 1999. In 1998, Sukh Ram's HVC under an alliance with the BJP supported the candidature of Maheshwar Singh, who won easily. In 2004, Congress candidate Pratibha Singh defeated Maheshwar Singh.  In the last Parliament elections 2009, Congress candidate Virbhadra Singh defeated Maheshwar Singh by a very small gap.\n\nVidhan Sabha segments\nMandi Lok Sabha constituency presently comprises the following 17 Vidhan Sabha (legislative assembly) segments:\n\nMembers of Lok Sabha\n\n^ bye-poll\n\nElection results\n\n2021 by-election\n\n2019 Election\n\n2014 election\n\n2013 by-election\n\n2009 election\n\n2004 election\n\n1999 election\n\n1998 election\n\n1996 election\n\n1991 election\n\n1989 election\n\n1984 election\n\n1980 election\n\n1977 election\n\n1971 election\n\n1967 election\n\n1962 election\n\n1957 election\n\n1951 election\n\n \n \n\nStations and 2 Auxiliary polling stations are being set up in the Four Parliamentary Constituencies for Lok Sabha Elections – 2009 in the State. 1259 Pole been declared as sensitive while 708 polling Stations have been classified as Hypersensitive to ensure free and fair elections in the State.

{"id": "4105526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This%20Is%20Tomorrow", "title": "This Is Tomorrow", "text": "This Is Tomorrow was an art exhibition in August 1956 at the Whitechapel Art Gallery on Whitechapel High Street in London's East End, UK, facilitated by curator Bryan Robertson. The core of the exhibition was the ICA Independent Group.\n\nHistory and philosophy\nThis is Tomorrow was a collaborative art exhibition that opened at the Whitechapel Art Gallery on 9 August 1956 and featured 12 exhibits within the show that featured collaborations between a variety of architects, painters, sculptors, and other artists. While each using their own style, they built pieces that represented their version of contemporary art. The result of the twelve groups was the attempt to evoke a variety of external environment through theories that were inspired by communications guru Marshall McLuhan, as well as symbols of pop culture. This is Tomorrow was nearly two years in the making, after architect and art critic Theo Crosby came up with the idea of mounting a large scale collaborative show at Whitechapel Gallery. By 1955 the participants were roughly divided into two camps; Constructivist, and the Independent Group, known for their meetings at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London with some overlap between the two groups. The 12 exhibits were each produced separately and were independent of each other. After This is Tomorrow opened nearly a thousand people a day saw the exhibit. The catalogue for the exhibit, designed by Independent member and graphic designer Edward Wright cost five shillings, a high price for 1956, sold out and had to be reprinted. This is Tomorrow is considered to be the forerunner of the British Pop Art movement.\n\nCrosby writes on 8 June 1955 that the discussions... are really the point of the collaboration... the exhibition will not be a collection of miscellaneous art works. The This Is Tomorrow exhibition included artists, architects, musicians and graphic designers working together in 12 teams—referred to as \"groups\"—an example of multi-disciplinary collaboration that was still unusual. Each group took as their starting point the human senses and the theme of habitation. Each group worked independently but saw the final display as one environment. In highlights from a 1979 documentary by the architectural critic Reyner Banham, artists and architects who were involved recall the sense of excitement they felt over the collaborations; the constraints of cost—only £50 was assigned to each group for materials; and their sense of the importance of the show within the context of the establishment they opposed. This is Tomorrow is viewed as a groundbreaking exhibition because of the issues it addressed early that later became crucial in contemporary art, not simply the process of collaborative action, but the whole notion of creating an environment inside the art gallery. The ripples of influence it created 50 years ago are still being felt today.\n\nAs Banham stated in his documentary: This is modern art to entertain people, modern art as a game people will want to play. The sense of involvement and fun carries through in the press clippings; journalists were most taken by the fact that the show was opened by Robby the Robot, star of the sci-fi movie Forbidden Planet and easier to book than Marilyn Monroe.\n\nGroup 2\nThe exhibition's most remembered exhibit was the room created by Group 2, comprising Richard Hamilton, John Voelcker and John McHale, though with help from Magda Cordell and Frank Cordell. It included the Op Art dazzle panels, collage Space modules, and pop art readymade of a Marilyn Monroe poster, the Van Gogh Sunflowers poster, a film advertising billboard of the Forbidden Planet, Robby the Robot,  a Jukebox, the strawberry perfumed carpet, an endless reel of film depicting the Royal Navy Fleet at sea, large Guinness beer bottles, a Marlon Brando poster image and a 'CinemaScope' collage mural design, and the design of the Pop art collage poster that were all provided by John McHale.\n\nFrank Cordell assisted McHale with accessing the film posters such as Julius Caesar (1953) for the collage murals, the Forbidden Planet items, the juke box, and installing the film projector, and installing the Duchamp rotor discs given to McHale by Marcel Duchamp in New York. Frank Cordell also installed the electronic amplifier and microphone enabling the ambient sounds from audience cybernetic feedback. The Senses panel with arrows featuring Tito was a joint collaboration between Hamilton and McHale, and the version reproduced in the catalogue was slightly different in wording to alter the optical perception of viewers. Hamilton later produced a third version depicting the Senses panel in an interior collage depicting the TIT, but he changed the face to Pierre Mendès France, and changed the Guinness beer bottles and altered other visual details in the mural. McHale and Hamilton collaborated on the Spectrum diagram reproduced in the exhibition catalogue, and McHale later produced a modified version of this in his Man Plus section in his book on the Future of the Future.\n\nThe Pop art poster Just What Is It that Makes Today's Homes So Different, So Appealing?, was designed by Hamilton for Group 2. A second poster, comprising intersecting arrows and swirls was designed by McHale and taken to the silk screen stage by Hamilton. McHale also supplied a third separate designed poster to Hamilton with an arrow, containing the formula E=MC2 which was a Pop art '\"mass\" consumer' reference to the Albert Einstein famous mass-energy equivalence relativity formula. But Hamilton chose not to collaborate on the third poster, and expend the 'creative \"energy\"' to bring the E=MC2 to final completion at the TIT.\n\nGroup 6\nGroup Six was composed of architects Alison and Peter Smithson and artists Eduardo Paolozzi and Nigel Henderson. The resulting work, \"Patio and Pavilion\", was a three walled structure with a corrugated plastic roof and surrounded by a sand patio. Found objects such as bike parts, a battered bugle and a clock without hands were strewn throughout the installation. In a country still recovering from war, the spare architecture offered an exploration of the fractured, but enduring presence of quotidian life during conflict.\n\nCatalogue and guides\nThe exhibition catalogue featured essays by Reyner Banham and Lawrence Alloway. McHale wrote the text for the page Are they Cultured? and it was intended to be featured with the McHale-designed collage that got mispaginated in the catalogue.\n\nColin St John Wilson designed the exhibition guide. The graphic designer Edward Wright (1912–88), who taught typography at the Central School of Art from 1950 to 1955 and then the Royal College of Art, designed the catalogue for This Is Tomorrow. Theo Crosby found the money for it, and it was printed by Lund Humphries. The director of Lund Humphries, Peter Gregory along with Peter Watson were among the original founding patrons of the ICA.\n\nLegacy\n\nThis is Tomorrow is now considered a watershed in post-war British Art and in some respects kick started the development of the British arm of Pop Art. The 1977 song \"This is Tomorrow\" from In Your Mind by Bryan Ferry, a student of Richard Hamilton's, took its title from the name of the show.\n\nParts of This Is Tomorrow were recreated in 1990 for an exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts.\n\nArtist teams in exhibition\n Group One: Theo Crosby, Germano Facetti, William Turnbull, Edward Wright\n Group Two: Richard Hamilton, John McHale, John Voelcker\n Group Three: J.

Elocutionist (1976), Tank's Prospect (1985), Pine Bluff (1992), Smarty Jones (2004), Afleet Alex (2005), Curlin (2007), and American Pharoah (2015) all won the Preakness Stakes.  1980 winner Temperence Hill, 1998's Victory Gallop, 2005's Afleet Alex, and 2015's American Pharoah all went on to capture the Belmont Stakes, as did Creator in 2016.  The 1994 winner, Concern, won that year's Breeders' Cup Classic.\n\nThe most celebrated Arkansas Derby champion is American Pharoah, who became the 12th Triple Crown winner and the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years. He is the first Arkansas Derby champion to win the Triple Crown. Like Smarty Jones, he too swept the Rebel and Arkansas Derby before winning the Kentucky Derby. The 2021 Arkansas Derby champion is Super Stock.\n\nPrior to American Pharoah's 2015 Triple Crown, Curlin had been the most decorated Arkansas Derby Winner, after winning races that included the 2007 Preakness Stakes, the 2007 Breeders' Cup Classic, and the 2008 Dubai World Cup. For his efforts, Curlin won the Eclipse Award in both 2007 and 2008 for American Horse of the Year, the highest honor given in American thoroughbred horse racing. Curlin was later admitted to thoroughbred racing's National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\n\nThe inaugural Arkansas Derby in 1936 offered a total purse of $5,000. The first winner was Holl Image, who was owned and trained by Jack Carter.\n\nThe race was run in two divisions in 1960, and again in 2020.  The 2020 race was moved to May 2, 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the Kentucky Derby had been moved to September. Both races will pay identical points towards Kentucky Derby eligibility.\n\nRecords\nSpeed  record:\n 1:46.80 – Althea (1984)\n\nMost wins by a jockey:\n 3 – Pat Day (1986, 1987, 1997)\n\nMost wins by a trainer:\n 5 – Todd A.

{"id": "4105550", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent%20Civilian", "title": "Silent Civilian", "text": "Silent Civilian is an American heavy metal band originating from Los Angeles, California. Following his departure from nu metal band Spineshank in 2004, frontman Jonny Santos felt he wanted to move in a different direction musically and start from scratch. Silent Civilian was thus formed and the band faced trouble from the start after experiencing several line-up changes and departing from their original record label Corporate Punishment Records.\n\nThe band signed with Mediaskare Records and released their debut record, Rebirth of the Temple, in 2006. Receiving generally positive reviews, the album has sold more than 25,000 copies since its release in the United States. Their line-up consists of Santos (vocals and guitar), Matt Bredemeier (guitar) and Robbie Young (bass) and Alex Morgan (drums)\n\nSilent Civilian released their second album, Ghost Stories, on in 2010. The band has plans to release a third studio album. In December 2022, the band announced that new material was in the works.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\nJonny Santos, who is best known as the vocalist and songwriter for the Grammy Award nominated industrial metal band Spineshank was displeased with the direction the band was going in and felt it had 'run its course'. Santos felt it was time to move on and left Spineshank, although he was unsure what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost everything and was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.\n\nRealizing he wanted to start a band from scratch, Santos placed an ad for a drummer on the social networking website MySpace. After receiving a large number of e-mails, Santos received an e-mail from Chris Mora with a video of him drumming. Santos thought \"You can’t be for real, dude\" and asked Mora to come down for the first audition. 10 minutes into the audition Mora was hired as the drummer. Santos auditioned for an Australian band that moved to America called Cryogenic. Although he thought the band was not for him, he met the band's bassist Henno. As Cryogenic and Mudrock, who were working together, had both lost their vocalists, Henno contacted Santos and asked him to join the band, to which Santos accepted. Ryan Ready, who Santos had known since high-school, was recruited as the second guitarist. The band's original name was announced as Silent Civilians, which originates from the world's climate change by that people have opinions on life and politics and they do not voice their beliefs, living in a nation full of 'silent civilians'.\n\nLabel and line-up changes\nSilent Civilians signed to Corporate Punishment Records in January 2005 and began work on their debut album, Rebirth of the Temple. However, in May Santos announced they left CPR for reasons he was unable to discuss. The band began talking to several labels after this and pushed the release of their debut to late 2005 or early 2006. The album was recorded at Undercity Recordings, with production duties handled by former Machine Head and Soulfly guitarist Logan Mader, and co-production handled by his partner, Lucas Banker. The band also announced they had changed their name to Silent Civilian. In June, guitarist Ryan Ready left the band due to personal reasons, not relating to the band. Santos sought a replacement, and the following day to Ready's departure set up auditions. Tim Mankowski, who Santos had known for 15 years and played in the band Basic Enigma with him, was hired as the new guitarist.\n\nIn November 2005, the band signed with Mediaskare records and planned a tentative release for their debut album for February 21, 2006. At this time, the band had three demo versions of the songs \"Lies in the House of Shame\", \"Divided\" and the title track, \"Rebirth of the Temple\". Mora and Santos were involved in the writing process of the album. While Mora was at work, Santos was at home writing riffs and would create roughly three to four 'skeletons of songs' a week. When Mora finished work, he would help Santos with arrangements, the body of the song, and track it that night and record the vocals and melodies the following day. 30 songs were primarily written for the album as Santos wanted fans to get their money's worth. 16 songs were recorded that included two cover versions of the thrash metal band Slayer's \"War Ensemble” and Death Angel's \"Seemingly Endless Time\". Although neither cover songs made it onto the album. The length of the CD is 64 minutes, which features the video of the album's title track, and an exclusive 10-minute documentary on the creation process of the album.\n\nRebirth of the Temple (2006–2007)\nSilent Civilian released their debut album Rebirth of the Temple on May 2, 2006. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Scott Alisoglu thought \"on virtually every track, the group meshes attacking riffs, searing solos, brutal drumming, and melody-drenched bombast\". Although he did not believe it was a 'grand slam', he thought it was a \"pleasant surprise and strong first effort\". Charlie Steffens of KNAC described the album as \"goddamn electric\", while Greg Maki of live-metal.net awarded the album a perfect 10 out of 10 selecting it as his \"best album I have heard so far in 2006.\" As of June 5, 2007, Rebirth of the Temple has sold 25,000 copies.\n\nThe video for the first single, \"Rebirth of the Temple\", was directed by Scott Culver and was filmed at Santos' childhood home. Santos invited 50 friends over for a party and posted a bulletin that read \"If you’re in the L.A. area, if you’re a Silent Civilian fan, show up at this address\" two hours before filming. This resulted in another 30 people turning up. Static-X front-man Wayne Static, Stone Sour drummer Roy Mayorga and Logan make appearances in the video.\n\nTim Mankowski departed the band  and Henno broke his ankle on an on-stage mishap. The band continued to tour as a three-piece as they sought for a replacement guitarist and bassist as soon as possible — Henno was able to perform on a bar stool temporarily. While touring with Nothingface and Crossbreed, Santos had met guitarist Marcus Rafferty, who he became friends with and recruited him to replace Mankowski after an audition. Touring partners Bleed the Sky assisted in replacing members for live shows. Bassist Disco Daylen took to the stage replacing Henno and guitarist Kyle Moorman assisted with the replacement of the guitarist by playing half the set and Rafferty would play the other. Santos asked Rafferty if he knew any bass players who were interested in a position, he contacted a friend of his, Stan Derby, who replaced Disco after one month.\n\nIn a July 2006 interview with Live-Metal.net, Santos stated the band was planning on recording a tribute EP of cover versions on old Bay Area music, including such bands as Sacred Reich, Death Angel, Exodus and Testament. The band is touring on The Sweet Revenge Tour with Kittie, It Dies Today and Bring Me the Horizon and by the end of the year Santos hopes to establish the band as a headlining act. On December 28, 2007, in a statement released to Blabbermouth.net, Mora explained his departure from the band was based on personal reasons.\n\nGhost Stories (2008–present)\nAs of November 12, 2008, their official Myspace page confirmed that they are currently writing a new record. In March 2009, their Myspace page stated that the new record will be called Ghost Stories. On June 11, 2010, the band's Myspace was updated with a new song titled \"Ghost Stories\" which would be featured on the upcoming album. Ryan Halpert ignited the band as Chris Mora's replacement on drums in mid-2009. Their sophomore album Ghost Stories was released via Mediaskare Records on May 18, 2010. In 2013, bassist Robbie Young launched his new project Atlas.\n\nThe band has plans to release a third studio album. As of December 2017, no new material has been released.\n\nIn 2018, Silent Civilian launched a crowfunding campaign to raise money for the production of a third album, with a goal of US$20,000. As of January 2020, they had only raised $5,435 but claim to still be making the album regardless. In 2019, the band launched an online store, but it has since shut down for unknown reasons.\n\nOn January 20, 2023, Silent Civilian released \"De La Muerte\", a new song from their upcoming third album, due to be released in 2023 via Black Horse Entertainment. The band had previously released \"My Addiction\" the month prior.\n\nMembers\n Jonny Santos – vocals, guitar (2005–present)\n Robbie Young – bass (2009–present)\n Matt Bredemeier – guitar, vocals (2011-2013, 2020-present)\n Alex Morgan - drums (2020-present)\n\nFormer\n Ryan Ready – guitar (2005)\n Daylen Elsen – bass (2006–2007)\n Tim Mankowski – guitar (2005–2006, recorded Rebirth of the Temple)\n Henno – bass (2005–2006, recorded Rebirth of the Temple)\n Chris \"Mad Man\" Mora (Black Veil Brides) – drums (2005–2007, recorded Rebirth of the Temple) \n Dave Delacruz – guitar (2008–2010, 2018-2020)\n Ryan Halpert – drums (2009–2010, recorded Ghost Stories)\nZac Morris - drums (2012)\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nSingles\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Silent Civilian on Myspace\n \n\nMusical groups established in 2005\nHeavy metal musical groups from California\nMetalcore musical groups from California\nMusical groups from Los Angeles"}

{"id": "4105560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer%20ha-Chinuch", "title": "Sefer ha-Chinuch", "text": "Sefer ha-Chinuch (, \"Book of Education\")  is a Jewish rabbinic text which systematically discusses the 613 commandments of the Torah. It was published anonymously in 13th-century Spain.\n\nHistory\nThe work's enumeration of the commandments (; sing. mitzvah) is based upon Maimonides' system of counting as per his Sefer Hamitzvot; each is listed according to its appearance in the weekly Torah portion and the work is structured correspondingly.\n\nThe book separately discusses each of the 613 commandments, both from a legal and a moral perspective. For each, the Chinuch's discussion starts by linking the mitzvah to its Biblical source, and then addresses the philosophical underpinnings of the commandment (here, termed the \"shoresh\", or \"root\"). Following this, the Chinuch presents a brief overview of the halakha (practical Jewish law) governing its observance - usually based on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah - and closes with a summary as to the commandment's applicability.\n\nBecause of this structure, the work remains popular to this day. The philosophic portions are widely quoted and taught, while the legal discussion provides the basis for much further study in yeshivot. The Minchat Chinuch by \"Rabbeinu Yosef\" (Yosef Ben Moshe Babad, 1800–1874), Av Beit Din of Ternopil, serves as a legal commentary.\n\nAuthorship\nThe sixteenth century author Gedaliah ibn Yaḥyah credited the Sefer ha-Chinuch to Rabbi Aharon HaLevi of Barcelona (1235-c. 1290), a Talmudic scholar and halakhist; but others disagree, as the views of the Chinuch contradict opinions held by HaLevi in other works. This has led to the conclusion that the true author to Sefer HaChinuch was a different Reb Aharon Halevi, a student of the Rashba, rather than his colleague. Though there is a debate about who is the true author, it is agreed upon that the Sefer ha-Chinuch was written by a father to his son, upon reaching the age of Bar Mitzvah. In 1980, Professor Israel Ta-Shma of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem said that the author of \"Sefer ha-Chinuch\" was in fact Aaron's brother, Pinchas ben Joseph ha-Levi.\n\nSee also\nSefer Mitzvot Gadol\nSefer Mitzvot Katan\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nTranslation: The Book of Mitzvah Education.

{"id": "4105566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%20Day%20No%20Pigs%20Would%20Die", "title": "A Day No Pigs Would Die", "text": "A Day No Pigs Would Die is a semi-autobiographical novel by Robert Newton Peck about Rob Peck, a boy coming of age in rural Vermont on an impoverished farm.  Originally published in 1972, it is one of the first books to be categorized as young adult fiction, in addition to being Peck's first novel; the sequel, A Part of the Sky, was published in 1994.\n\nBackground \n\nRobert Newton Peck was born on February 17, 1928, in Ticonderoga, New York to Frank Haven Peck and Lucile Dornburgh Peck, who may have had an interest in the tenets of Shakerism. He served as a machine-gunner in the 88th Infantry Division during World War II, and then upon returning home in 1947 enrolled in Rollins College. After graduating in 1953, Peck began taking courses at Cornell Law School, but never finished. He pursued multiple careers during his adult life, including working as a lumberjack, in a paper mill, and he even killed hogs. Eventually, Peck began working as an advertising scriptwriter for American Home Products.\n\nPeck had long believed that \"the brutal truths of farm life survival are quite beautiful\", and had wanted to write about them since he was eleven. It took him thirty-three years to do so. Peck starting publishing young adult novels at the age of forty-four, using the time he spent commuting to and from New York City – ten hours a week – to write; working this way, he produced the manuscripts for five young adult novels in just three years. A Day No Pigs Would Die was written over the course of three weeks and became Peck's first published work.\n\nPlot summary \n\nWhile skipping school one day, twelve-year-old Rob Peck finds himself assisting a neighbor's cow through the delivery of a pair of calves (and saving her life from her goiter). He is injured in the process but eventually recovers and the farmer whose animals he helped gives Rob a piglet. He names the piglet Pinky. Pinky quickly becomes Rob's best friend and closest companion save for his father, Haven, a butcher working to save money to pay off the Peck family's farm. Unfortunately, Pinky is barren and they eventually decide that they have to kill the piglet if it cannot bring the family any more piglets or profit. Robert hates his father when he kills Pinky but understands that his father is heartbroken as well. Rob's father, Haven, dies in his sleep a few months later and Rob discovers while doing random chores that his father had been trying to teach himself to write.\n\nMain characters \n Robert Peck:  The sheltered twelve-year-old narrator who learns to be a man from his farmer father and his best friend, his pet pig Pinky.\n Haven Peck:  Rob's faux-Shaker father; a poor, illiterate farmer who wants to provide for his family and teach his son how to grow up right.\n Pinky:  A sow given to Rob in thanks for his helping Mr. Tanner's cow through a difficult birth. \n Lucy Peck:  Rob's caring, resilient mother who fears that her son is growing up too quickly. \n Aunt Carrie:  Lucy's older sister who lives with the Pecks and serves as a second mother to Rob.\n Benjamin Tanner:  A Baptist farmer who is a neighbor and friend to the Peck family.\n\nThemes \nA Day No Pigs Would Die, like many of Peck's books, draws from his childhood experiences, dealing with the maturation of children growing up in country settings in the early part of the twentieth century. The Peck family and their neighbors all farm and engage in animal husbandry, including butchering and preparing their own meat, and Rob's life is strongly limited by the isolation of his environment. An unexpected trip to the city of Rutland and how different it is from the world that Rob is used to is the central focus of chapters ten and eleven of the novel.\n\nThe Peck family, living during Calvin Coolidge's presidency shortly before the beginning of the Great Depression, is poor, and it is their poverty that necessitates one of the tragedies of the book. Winter is unusually cold, the Pecks' apple orchard has produced a poor crop, and game is in short supply. Needing food and not having the money to care for a barren animal, Rob and Haven have to kill Pinky.\n\nThe adults in the Peck family are illiterate, and Haven tells Rob that this inability has kept him from voting. Rob does well in school, however, and his family is supportive of his education, allowing a relative to tutor him when his English grades are low. When Rob exclaims that he wants to be just like his father, Haven responds, \"No boy, you won't. You'll have your schooling. You'll read and write and cipher.\"\n\nReligion also plays a large part in this work. Rob and his family call themselves Shakers, although they appear to be only selectively following the tenets of this religion. Peck describes \"Shakers who marry, live in nuclear families, read a Shaker 'bible,' and attend a Shaker church.\" Shakers, however, do not form into traditional family units, have a distinct scriptural text, or procreate. Rob also tells Pinky about the ability of his Shaker namesake to commit acts of violence, which diverges from the Shaker commitment to pacifism, and Haven Peck places importance on earning the wealth to buy his farm, while Shakers were not permitted to own personal property.\n\nAt first, Rob has a negative opinion of people who are not practicing Shakers, actually believing that being a Baptist would be worse than going to hell. He eventually questions and overcomes this prejudice as he learns that the Tanners, who are good neighbors and trusted friends to the Pecks, are actually Baptists.\n\nA Day No Pigs Would Die has been noted for not withdrawing from the harsh realities of birth and death, despite being written for youth. From the first chapter, \"readers begin to understand the value of life, the ever-present possibility of death, and the need for self-reliance\".  The book opens with Rob helping a cow through a bloody, difficult birth. He later has Pinky breed for the first time, in a graphic scene, and must then help his father butcher Pinky, after she proves to be barren and too costly for the family to keep if she cannot bear piglets for them to sell. And, in the closing chapters of the text, Haven Peck comes down with \"an affection\", sickens and dies, leaving Rob to arrange his funeral and then deal with the fact that, now thirteen, he must be considered a man for the sake of his family's continued welfare.\n\nReception \n\nA Day No Pigs Would Die grossed $300,000 in its first four months in stores, drawing the attention of Twentieth Century Fox, who approached Peck about creating a film adaptation of the novel.\n\nIt has received the Colorado Children's Book Award (1972) and has been named to several best books lists, including the ALA Best Books for Young Adults (1973), the Library of Congress Children's Books of the Year (1973), and the School Library Journal Best Books of the Year (1973). In 2005, it made the list of the top 1000 titles owned by Online Computer Library Center members, a list of \"the intellectual works that have been judged to be worth owning by the 'purchase vote' of libraries around the globe\".\n\nIn a nationwide survey of English teachers and librarians conducted in 1976, A Day No Pigs Would Die, was one of only four books (Cormier's The Chocolate War, Zindel's The Pigman, and Hinton's The Outsiders were the other three) that was recommended more than four times.\n\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer said that A Day No Pigs Would Die is \"a fantastic adventure, told simply and graphically, with echoes somehow of Mark Twain and of Stephen Vincent Benet\". The New York Times claimed that \"you'll find yourself caught up in the novel's emotion from the very opening scene which will grab you and not let you go...love suffuses every pages\" and likened it stylistically to True Grit and Addie Pray. The Boston Globe deemed it \"honest, moving, homely in the warm and simple sense of the word,\" and Jerry Weiss and James Alexander have agreed, calling it, respectively, \"homespun culture at its finest\" and \"a bucolic gentle book\". The School Library Journal said it shows \"plenty of Yankee common sense and dry wit, and some pathos... [it is] for boys of this age and for the young of any age\". And Newsweek declared that \"reading this book is like sipping hot cider in front of a crackling potbellied stove. Every page is suffused with wit and charm and glowing with warmth.\"\n\nA Day No Pigs Would Die is an early book in the development of the adolescent literature genre. It was written during the second generation of young adult literature, so it was able to avoid what young adult novelist Richard Peck described as \"an annoying pioneer period that coincided with the late 1960s in which a great many books were pretty cheap propaganda\", that disappeared rapidly with the demise of the youth culture of the 1960s. Peck's novel is still being used in classrooms today, over forty years after its initial publication, because it combines aspects of literary form considered suitable for adult consumption with a sophisticated subject matter, making it a high level book that is easily approachable for lower level readers.\n\nCensorship \nA Day No Pigs Would Die has been a frequent target for censorship, coming in as 16th on the American Library Association's list of the books that were most often challenged in the 1990s.\n\nIt has largely been censored because it has content that has been seen as sexually explicit and graphically violent, with specific complaint given to a pig breeding scene, which has been likened to a rape. Pinky \"resists the male's advances—at one point sinking her teeth into his ear in protest. 'All part of courting,' says the sow's owner. 'Samson just got his face slapped. That's all.' In the scene that follows, the boar violently overpowers the sow and after being bruised, battered, and bloodied, she can't stop whining.\" However, the graphic nature of this scene may be meaningful particularly because it is explicit. MIT lecturer in Comparative Media Studies Amy Carleton notes that it gave her a means by which to have a conversation about consent with her child.\n\nParents have objected to the book's \"graphic and gory descriptions\" of animals being bred, born, and dying, as well as to its including such \"shocking content\" as an unmarried couple cohabiting. Another complainant maintained that Peck was \"trying to depict Shaker life but... really showing a perverted lifestyle as their norm.\" Others have protested that A Day No Pigs Would Die \"appeals to the erotic and at times prurient mentality\", and features \"scenes of brutality\".  The book has also been targeted because it uses \"objectionable\" language, such as the words \"damn\" and \"bitch\".\n\nThere has also been some concern that A Day No Pigs Would Die would have a negative influence on adolescent male readers, conditioning boys to view \"violence and killing as a part of their initiation into the adult world\". A Day No Pigs Would Die has been seen as a particularly vicious example of the young adult novel stereotype that boys become men only after committing an act of violence against an animal or another part of the natural world. Rob, after helping his father slaughter Pinky, is told that he now knows what it is to be a man, enforcing the idea that boys must pass into the \"cult of the kill\" in order to mature.\n\nSequel \nPeck published a sequel, A Part of the Sky, in 1994. It picks up where A Day No Pigs Would Die leaves off, following Rob's decision to leave school in order to find employment so that he can pay for the farm and care for his mother and aunt, despite being only thirteen.\n\nA Part of the Sky was not as well received as its predecessor; the New York Times said that it \"has the disconcerting effect of making us wonder whether we were wrong about the first book. Was it really so lugubrious and uplifting? Dare we go back? Don't worry. From the first page, A Day No Pigs Would Die pulls readers into its world and holds us fast with a combination of harsh realism, tenderness and laughter that sweeps to the heartbreaking ending.\"\n\nReferences \n\n1972 American novels\nAlfred A.

{"id": "4105584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill%20Musgrave", "title": "Bill Musgrave", "text": "William Scott Musgrave (born November 11, 1967) is an American football coach and former player who is the senior offensive assistant for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He is a former quarterback, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for multiple NFL teams. He played college football at the University of Oregon. He is also the uncle of Green Bay Packers tight end Luke Musgrave.\n\nMusgrave is a 21-year coaching veteran with 19 years of NFL experience as a quarterbacks coach or offensive coordinator. He has previously coached in the NFL with the Denver Broncos (2017–18), Oakland Raiders (2015–16, 1997), Philadelphia Eagles (2014, 1998), Minnesota Vikings (2011–13), Atlanta Falcons (2006–10), Washington Redskins (2005), Jacksonville Jaguars (2003–04) and Carolina Panthers (1999–2000). During his coaching career, Musgrave helped three different quarterbacks to Pro Bowl seasons: Derek Carr (2015–16), Matt Ryan (2010) and Steve Beuerlein (1999).\n\nEarly years\nMusgrave attended Grand Junction High School, earning All-conference honors at safety as a sophomore. The next year he was named the starter at quarterback and earned All-conference honors in his last 2 seasons.\n\nHe was the Colorado High School Athlete of the Year in 1985, after registering 30 touchdown passes (a state record). He also received the Denver Post Gold Helmet Award as the state's top scholar football athlete.\n\nCollege career\nMusgrave accepted a football scholarship from the University of Oregon, at a time when the school had only four winning seasons in the last 22 years and hadn't been invited to a bowl game since 1963. He became a starter as a freshman, leading his team to a No. 16 national ranking, including wins against USC and Washington. \n\nAs a sophomore, he helped Oregon achieve a top 20 ranking and a 6-1 record, until breaking his collarbone against Arizona State University. The team went winless in the last 4 games.\n\nAs a junior, he posted 3,081 passing yards, 22 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. Against BYU, he passed for a then school-record 489 yards, combining with Cougars quarterback Ty Detmer who tallied 470 passing yards, to set an NCAA record for passing yardage in a game by two players.\n\nAs a senior, he was named team MVP, first-team All-conference quarterback, GTE Academic All-American of the Year, and earned a Scholar-Athlete Award by the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame. In his final game he injured his shoulder in the fourth quarter against UCLA, only to return and throw a 16-yard touchdown pass with 2:10 remaining for a 28–24 win.\n\nHe was a four-year starter at quarterback and a three-year team captain, while leading the Oregon to its first bowl game in 26 years and to back-to-back bowl appearances for the first time in school history. He finished with 8,343 passing yards, a 57.4 passing percentage, 60 touchdowns and 40 interceptions. Musgrave finished as the school's all-time leader in passing yards and total offense, until being broken by Marcus Mariota in 2014. He set 15 passing records, while his 60 career passing touchdowns and 8,343 career yardage ranked second only to John Elway in Pacific-10 Conference history.\n\nIn 1996, he was inducted into the Colorado High School Activities Association Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was inducted into the University of Oregon Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\nCollege statistics\n1987: 139/234 for 1,836 yards with 13 TD vs 8 INT.\n1988: 62/121 for 815 yards with 8 TD vs 4 INT.\n1989: 231/401 for 3,081 yards with 22 TD vs 16 INT.\n1990: 173/301 for 2,219 yards with 14 TD vs 12 INT.\n\nProfessional career\n\nMusgrave was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (106th overall) of the 1991 NFL Draft. He went into training camp with Troy Aikman, Babe Laufenberg and Cliff Stoudt at quarterback. On August 25, the Cowboys traded for Steve Beuerlein to improve the backup position and released Musgrave and Stoudt, opting to keep just two quarterbacks.\n\nOn August 28, 1991, he was signed to the practice squad by the San Francisco 49ers. He was promoted to the active roster in week 11 and made his professional debut in the week 17 game against the Chicago Bears, throwing for a touchdown and 33 yards, after replacing Steve Young late in the contest. The next year, he was the fourth-string quarterback, until being placed on the injured reserve list on December 15. In 1993 and 1994, he was named the team's third-string quarterback and was rarely activated on game days. He played under head coach George Seifert and offensive coordinators Mike Holmgren and Mike Shanahan.\n\nIn 1995, he signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos, reuniting with Shanahan, who was the new team's head coach. He was the backup quarterback behind John Elway, before announcing his retirement on July 22, 1997.\n\nFollowing a brief coaching stint as the quarterbacks coach of the Oakland Raiders, Musgrave signed with the Indianapolis Colts on April 8, 1998, but was released during training camp.\n\nCoaching career\n\n1997−1998\nImmediately after being released as a player, Musgrave joined the Oakland Raiders as a quarterbacks coach in 1997 under head coach Joe Bugel. When the Raiders fired Bugel following the season, Musgrave attempted another try as a player with the Colts in 1998, but was released during training camp. He was immediately hired by the Philadelphia Eagles as an offensive assistant under Ray Rhodes, a former 49ers assistant coach. Musgrave was promoted to offensive coordinator and called plays in place of Dana Bible for the final 10 games of the season. However, Musgrave was not retained by new head coach Andy Reid when Rhodes was fired at the end of the season.\n\nCarolina Panthers\nMusgrave was hired as the quarterbacks coach under George Seifert with the Carolina Panthers in 1999, in an arrangement that saw he and Seifert having a heavy hand in calling the plays over offensive coordinator Gil Haskell.  Upon Haskell's departure to Seattle, Musgrave was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2000. The team chose him to replace Haskell, who was a holdover from a previous staff, due to his favorable relationship with Seifert as well as his experience calling plays the previous season. However, as an inexperienced coordinator, Musgrave had faltered at times, been criticized in the media for choices in playcalling, and was at one point rumored to have been yelled at by Seifert in front of the team. Musgrave resigned from the position after three games.\n\nVirginia\nMusgrave was hired as offensive coordinator, quarterbacks coach, and tight ends coach under Al Groh for the Virginia Cavaliers in 2001, tutoring quarterback Matt Schaub to school records in his two years as coach.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\nMusgrave was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars under new head coach Jack Del Rio in 2003. In 2004, he picked up additional duties as quarterbacks coach before he was fired at the conclusion of the season.\n\nAtlanta Falcons\nMusgrave was the quarterbacks coach for the Atlanta Falcons from 2006 to 2009. In 2010, Musgrave was promoted to assistant head coach/quarterbacks coach. Coaching quarterbacks with very different skillsets, Musgrave played a large role in the development of Michael Vick (2006), Matt Schaub (2006) and Matt Ryan (2008-10).\n\nMinnesota Vikings\nMusgrave was hired by the Minnesota Vikings to the position of offensive coordinator under head coach Leslie Frazier on January 16, 2011. The Vikings posted the top-ranked rushing offense in the league over that span, and Adrian Peterson had his 2,000 rushing yards season and received the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award in 2012. After three seasons with the Vikings, he was not retained by new head coach Mike Zimmer after the 2013 season.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nMusgrave was hired by the Philadelphia Eagles as the team's quarterbacks coach on January 27, 2014. The Eagles finished sixth in the league in passing offense (272.3 ypg) despite splitting time between two quarterbacks. Nick Foles and Mark Sanchez started eight games apiece for the Eagles and combined to throw for 4,581 yards—a total topped by only five NFL quarterbacks that season.\n\nOakland Raiders\nMusgrave was hired by head coach Jack Del Rio on January 19, 2015, to serve as offensive coordinator. Musgrave took over an offense that ranked last in the NFL in total offense (282.2 ypg) and 31st in scoring (15.9 ppg) in 2014. The Raiders made the biggest offensive improvement in the NFL in yards per game (+91.1) and scoring (+10.2 ppg) in two seasons under Musgrave, finishing in the top seven in the league in both categories in 2016 (373.3 ypg/26.0 ppg). The Raiders' offensive resurgence was spurred by the development of quarterback Derek Carr, who in two seasons in Musgrave's offense passed for nearly 8,000 yards to go along with 60 touchdowns.\n\nOn January 10, 2017, Musgrave's contract was not renewed, and was let go by head coach Jack Del Rio after losing to the Houston Texans in a wild card playoff game.\n\nDenver Broncos\nMusgrave was hired by the Broncos on January 13, 2017 to serve as the quarterbacks coach under new head coach Vance Joseph. He was promoted to offensive coordinator following the firing of offensive coordinator Mike McCoy on November 20, 2017. The Broncos posted a 6–10 record during the 2018–19 season. Musgrave's offense finished ranked 19th in total yards, 12th in rushing yards, and 19th in passing yards.\n\nFollowing the 2018–19 season, the Broncos hired Vic Fangio as head coach and did not retain Musgrave.\n\nCalifornia\nOn January 3, 2020, Musgrave was announced as the offensive coordinator for the California Golden Bears, replacing Beau Baldwin and marking his return to the college ranks after 18 years. Musgrave was let go on November 13, 2022 after the Golden Bears lost their sixth game in a row to Oregon State.\n\nCleveland Browns\nOn February 26, 2023, Musgrave was announced as a senior offensive assistant under HC Kevin Stefanski.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1967 births\nLiving people\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nAtlanta Falcons coaches\nCalifornia Golden Bears football coaches\nCarolina Panthers coaches\nDallas Cowboys players\nDenver Broncos players\nIndianapolis Colts players\nJacksonville Jaguars coaches\nMinnesota Vikings coaches\nOakland Raiders coaches\nOregon Ducks football players\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nPhiladelphia Eagles coaches\nSan Francisco 49ers players\nVirginia Cavaliers football coaches\nWashington Redskins coaches\nPeople from Grand Junction, Colorado\nPlayers of American football from Colorado"}

Its area is 1,243 km2 (the largest in Tekirdağ Province), and its population is 50,988 (2022). It is located at 55 km west of Tekirdağ and 190 km from Istanbul. The mayor is Ulaş Yurdakul (CHP).\n\nClimate\nThe district has cold winters, wet winds from the Balkans blow hard across Thrace.\n\nHistory\nThrace was the scene of fighting during the Persian Wars and the name Malkara is said to come from the Persian 'Margaar' meaning 'cave of snakes'. Alternatively the town may be named after 'Malgar' a general in the army of Alexander the Great who built a fortress here after they had succeeded in bringing to an end the Persian 30-year occupation of Thrace. These fortifications remained in use up until the Byzantine period.\n\nOnce the area had been brought under Ottoman control it was settled with Turks from Anatolia and a Turkish town emerged which thrived supplying the Ottoman cavalry regiments. Malkara was then used as a place of exile for those out of favor in the Ottoman court including:\n\n Hacı Evhat – personal tutor to Suleiman the Magnificent, who exiled Evhat in 1524 when he did not like the lessons\n Koca Sinan Pasha – statesman and Grand Vizier, exiled for four years here after the failure of his campaign against Persia in 1580\n Melek Ahmed Pasha – Grand Vizier, 1650–51\n Boynuyaralı Mehmed Pasha – Grand Vizier, 1656\n Bekri Mustafa Pasha – Grand Vizier, 1688–89\n\nThe 17th-century Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi described Malkara as a tidy, hard-working town of 150 houses of tiled roofs noted for production of honey, cheese, and leather.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century Malkara was the scene of an uprising by the Janissary troops in protest against plans by Sultan Selim III to replace them with a new model army.\n\nMalkara was occupied by Russian troops in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829, again by the Russians in The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 and most painfully by the Bulgarians for 8.5 months during the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913. In the aftermath of the 1913 Ottoman coup d'état, Malkara was reoccupied by Ottoman troops. \n\nDuring World War II, the Greek part of Thrace was occupied by German and Bulgarian troops, and when Turkey was preparing for a possible entry into the war against the Axis powers, refugees from Greece were briefly housed in Malkara for their safety.\n\nMalkara today\nMalkara is a small market town serving the countryside around it, which is mostly devoted to growing sunflowers for seeds and oil. There are also one or two coal mines. Many of the people of Malkara originate in the Balkans and are liberal- and secular-minded.\n\nComposition\nThere are 77 neighbourhoods in Malkara District:\n\n Ahievren\n Ahmetpaşa\n Aksakal\n Alaybey\n Allıışık\n Bağpınarı\n Balabancık\n Ballı\n Ballısüle\n Batkın\n Bayramtepe\n Camiatik\n Çavuş Köy\n Çimendere\n Çınaraltı\n Çınarlıdere\n Danişment\n Davuteli\n Deliller\n Demircili\n Dereköy\n Deveci\n Develi\n Doğan Köy\n Dolu\n Elmalı\n Emirali\n Esendik\n Evrenbey\n Gazibey\n Gönence\n Gözsüz\n Güneşli\n Hacıevlat\n Hacısungur\n Halıç\n Hasköy\n Hemit\n Hereke\n İbribey\n İbrice\n İshakça\n Izgar\n Kadiköy\n Kalaycı\n Karacagür\n Karacahalil\n Karaiğdemir\n Karamurat\n Kavakçeşme\n Kermeyan\n Kiremitlik\n Kırıkali\n Kozyürük\n Küçükhıdır\n Kürtüllü\n Kuyucu\n Mestanlar\n Müstecep\n Pirinççeşme\n Sağlamtaş\n Şahin\n Sarıpolat\n Sarıyar\n Sarnıçköy\n Sırtbey\n Tekke Köy\n Teteköy\n Vakıfiğdemir\n Yayla Köy\n Yaylagöne\n Yeni\n Yenice\n Yenidibek\n Yılanlı\n Yörücek\n Yörük\n\nPlaces of interest\nThe village of Yenidibek with its reservoir and ruined Byzantine castle is a popular picnic spot.\n\nReferences\n\n \nPopulated places in Tekirdağ Province\nFormer Greek towns in Turkey\nDistricts of Tekirdağ Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey"}

Lombardi also previously served as an assistant coach for the Atlanta Falcons. He is the grandson of Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Vince Lombardi.\n\nEarly years\nA 1994 graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, Lombardi played tight end for the Falcons under head coach Fisher DeBerry. He lettered three seasons and started as a senior; he also lettered a season in lacrosse. He served his four years on active duty in the Air Force, where he was a program manager on the F-22 program at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

This is mostly fertile farmland and agriculture is well-developed in Manavgat, keeping livestock and growing crops including grains, sesame and many fruits and vegetables; in recent years olives have also been planted. There is no industry except for food-processing, so apart from agriculture the local economy depends on tourism. \n\nThe mountains are covered with forests and typical Mediterranean shrubs, there are small plains higher in the mountains too, traditionally used for summer grazing by the yörük nomads. Manavgat has a Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and warm, wet winters; the temperature rarely drops to freezing. The district is irrigated by the Manavgat River, and has two dams for hydro-electric power. In 2001 plans began to export water from these reservoirs to Israel and other Mediterranean countries including Malta and Cyprus; as of 2006 these plans are on hold.\n\nHistory\nThe ancient cities of Side and Selge date back to the 6th century BC. Manavgat was taken over by the Seljuk Turks in 1220 and the Ottoman Empire in 1472.The town also has a castle named \"Zindan Kalesi\"literally Dungeon Castle in English.\n\nTourism\nWith  of hot, sunny coastline, much of it sandy beaches, with a long river and the waterfall, well-protected countryside including mountains and forests, Manavgat has an important tourist industry. There is plenty of accommodation on the coastline and many places to explore including historical sites, rivers, streams and caves. And there is the sea itself including the odd experience of swimming from fresh water into the salt sea at the rivermouth. Predictably the cuisine includes fish from the Mediterranean. \nThe villages of Kumköy and Ilıca on the coast are particularly lively.\n\nPlaces of interest\n Köprülü Canyon - in the middle of a forested national park; the canyon is popular for river-rafting.\n The antique cities of:\n Side, with its theatre and port.\nSeleucia (Pamphylia) - visited by Alexander the Great\nSelge\nManavgat Waterfall, and another smaller waterfall on the river.\nOymapinar Dam\nTilkiler Cave\n\nComposition\nThere are 106 neighbourhoods in Manavgat District:\n\n Ahmetler\n Aksaz\n Altınkaya\n Aşağıhisar\n Aşağıışıklar\n Aşağıpazarcı\n Aydınevler\n Bahçelievler\n Ballıbucak\n Belenobası\n Bereket\n Beşkonak\n Beydiğin\n Boztepe\n Bucakşeyhler\n Büklüce\n Burmahan\n Çağlayan\n Çakış\n Çaltepe\n Çardakköy\n Çavuşköy\n Çayyazı\n Çeltikçi\n Çenger\n Cevizler\n Çolaklı\n Değirmenözü\n Demirciler\n Denizkent\n Denizyaka\n Dikmen\n Doğançam\n Dolbazlar\n Düzağaç\n Emek\n Eski Hisar\n Evrenleryavşı\n Evrenseki\n Gaziler\n Gebece\n Gençler\n Gültepe\n Gündoğdu\n Güzelyalı\n Hacıali\n Hacıisalı\n Hacıobası\n Halitağalar\n Hatipler\n Hocalar\n Hocalı\n Ilıca\n Kadılar\n Kalemler\n Karabucak\n Karabük\n Karacalar\n Karakaya\n Karaöz\n Karavca\n Kasaplar\n Kavaklı\n Kırkkavak\n Kısalar\n Kızılağaç\n Kızıldağ\n Kızılot\n Milli Egemenlık\n Mimarsinan\n Namaras\n Odaönü\n Örenşehir\n Örnek\n Oymapınar\n Perakende\n Sağırin\n Salkım Evler\n Salur\n Sanayi\n Saraçlı\n Sarılar\n Şelale\n Sevinçköy\n Seydiler\n Side\n Sırtköy\n Şişeler\n Sorgun\n Sülek\n Taşağıl\n Taşkesiği\n Tepeköy\n Tilkiler\n Ulukapı\n Uzunkale\n Uzunlar\n Yalçıdibi\n Yavrudoğan\n Yayla\n Yaylaalan\n Yeniköy\n Yeşilbağ\n Yukarıhisar\n Yukarıışıklar\n Yukarıpazarcı\n\nGallery\n\nExternal links \n\n Manavgat - Manavgat Excellent Photos\n Some 50 pictures of the town\n Side-Manavgat - Side and Manavgat\n Titreyengol.com - Titreyengöl in Manavgat\n\nReferences\n\nTurkish Riviera\nPopulated places in Antalya Province\nDistricts of Antalya Province\n \nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey"}

They released their debut album, Get in Line, in 1990.\n\nHistory\nAtom Seed were formed in early 1989 in London, England, after former Zoodoll guitarist Simon James and bassist Chris Huxter met with singer Paul Cunningham and the Iranian-born drummer Amir. After recording a demo and playing a handful of gigs, Huxter left in late 1989 and was replaced by Chris Dale on bass. The band toured the UK constantly as headliners and also supporting Wolfsbane and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their debut EP was released in early 1990, followed in 1991 by the album Get in Line on FM Revolver Records. Amir was replaced by Jerry Hawkins (formerly of Metal Monkey Machine) on drums before the band's debut European tour. They were signed to London Records for the Dead Happy EP in 1992, but were dropped from the label and split up soon after, with an unreleased album, Hard Sell Paranoia, shelved.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of Atom Seed, Chris Dale went on to perform, record, and write for Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. Dale now plays for the British heavy metal band Tank as well as his own pop rock band, Sack Trick. Simon James formed the band Moko Jumbi, recording an album for A&M Records in 1996 which remained unreleased after the label folded.

{"id": "4105641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazgirt", "title": "Mazgirt", "text": "Mazgirt (; ), is a town and seat of the Mazgirt District of the Tunceli Province in Turkey. It had a population of 1,344 in 2021 and is populated by Kurds.\n\nThe current mayor is Murat Becerikli from the Justice and Development Party (AKP).\n\nThe town has a number of interesting buildings, such as an abandoned castle, an old mosque, and an Armenian church which is soon to be renovated.\n\nIt is divided into the neighborhoods of Eltihatun and Yenimahalle.\n\nGeography \nMazgirt is located in a bowl-shaped depression in the heights overlooking the Munzur Su valley. On the west side of town is a rocky outcrop that has a commanding view of the brush-covered slopes below. This outcrop historically served as the castle rock.\n\nThe main road coming from Tunceli turns sharply southeast just beneath the castle rock and then becomes the main commercial street in town. There is a gentle slope uphill as it runs southeast to the main town square, which is where the high school is located. The historic Elti Hatun mosque and türbe are located further north, along with the old Armenian church of Surb Hakop.\n\nHistorically, Mazgirt was the start point of a route that led to Pülümür through wooded valleys and hills, thus connecting the Dersim region with the upper reaches of the Euphrates while bypassing the narrow Kutu Dere upstream from Tunceli.\n\nHistory \nHistorically a market town, Mazgirt was an important fortified settlement during the period of Arab rule (7th to 10th centuries). It lay in a border region and was likely connected to Bağın and then Kiğı by a road for defensive purposes.\n\nIn 1144, Arslan-Doğmuş, brother of the Artukid ruler Kara Arslan, seized Mazgirt and made it his capital. Mazgirt's high and relatively inaccessible position made it a good place for him to resist his brother's rule, but he died in 1148 after only four years in power and Kara Arslan took over Mazgirt.\n\nMonuments\n\nElte Hatun Cami \nThe medieval Elte Hatun Cami is built out of a dark purplish composite stone and consists of a main prayer hall with a smaller entrance hall adjoining it on the east side of the north wall. There is a garden on the east side of the complex, although the gate is usually kept locked. There is a çeşme or fountain outside the entrance hall on the north; inside the building on the same wall is a niche where water was also piped in. These were designed for worshippers to perform the ghusl washing required before prayer; the fountain outside would have been used mostly during summer while the one inside would have been used during winter.\n\nThe mosque was founded in 1252-3 by Elte Hatun, daughter of a prince named Süleyman. She probably belonged to the Seljuk dynasty, since Mazgirt had come under Seljuk control in 1234 when they annexed the principality of Harput. A medrese, which was probably founded at the same time as the mosque, formerly existed to the east; the garden wall was built over its remains.\n\nElte Hatun Türbesi \nThe Elte Hatun Türbesi is purportedly the tomb of the same Elte Hatun, but in reality this is unlikely - the carvings are of a much lower quality than the mosque's - and the türbe was probably built well after Elte Hatun's lifetime, perhaps in the 15th century. Whoever the tomb actually belongs to is unknown.\n\nCastle \nThe castle rock is basically shaped like an elongated platform running from northwest to southeast. Steep cliffs provide a natural barrier on all sides except the southeast, which has a gentler slope. An inner rocky outcropping juts up from the main platform towards the northwest end. The castle walls are only standing in some places. The masonry that survives is mostly the same dark reddish-purple stone as the Elte Hatun mosque and likely date from the same period (mid-13th century). On the inner outcropping there is a circular pit carved out of the rock whose original purpose is unknown; a \"rectangular block of masonry\" built partly over its western side belonged to an old windmill that was built on the site at a later date.\n\nArmenian churches \nThe Armenian church of Surb Hakop appears to date from the 16th or 17th century, although it was probably rebuilt from the ruins of an earlier church. The present structure is somewhat awkwardly proportioned - it seems truncated - and the previous building was probably larger than the one today. The remains of a second Armenian church, probably a basilica, is located on the northeast slope of the citadel. This one is hard to date but may have been built in the Middle Ages.\n\nReferences\n\nPopulated places in Mazgirt District\nKurdish settlements in Tunceli Province\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey"}

Until the 2010s, it offered regular connections to Kathmandu and Jomsom; and seasonal connections to Manang. In 2011 Buddha Air, a Nepali private airline, began international flights from Pokhara to Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow, India, and announced plans to fly to New Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport in the future.

Pokhara Airport is a diversion airport for the country's main airport in Kathmandu in times of problems such as fog. Due to a short runway and crowded apron, flights must often be re-diverted to third airports with even shorter runways.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nSeveral Ultralight aviation companies offer recreational and sightseeing flights from Pokhara Airport.\n\nStatistics\n\nIncidents and accidents\nOn 6 November 1997, a Necon Air Avro 748-100 had a hydraulic failure after landing from a flight from Kathmandu Airport. The pilot attempted to steer the plane, but it hit another stationary Hawker Siddeley HS 748.

{"id": "4105688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menemen", "title": "Menemen", "text": "Menemen is a municipality and district of İzmir Province, Turkey. Its area is 573 km2, and its population is 200,904 (2022). The district extends on a fertile plain formed by the alluvial soil carried by the Gediz River. Adjacent districts are, from east to west; Aliağa and Foça to the north and Bornova, Karşıyaka and Çiğli to the south. Menemen district has a  long coastline in the west and neighbors Manisa Province to the east. The town of Menemen is located at a distance of  from İzmir center (Konak Square). Settlement across the district is loosely scattered along the Greater Metropolitan Area of İzmir in the south and consists of isolated villages along prairies in the north, which results in an average urbanization rate of only 42 per cent. The economy still relies on agriculture and stock breeding in large part, although the production and export of leather, ceramic and other earthenware products, as well as potentially of plastic products, based in two separate and specialized organized industrial zones made important steps forward during the last decade. Menemen's earthenware pottery products have been famous across Turkey for centuries. These two organized industrial zones as well as activities rebounding from the adjacent İzmir metropolitan area gain an increasing importance in the district's economy. Nevertheless, Gediz River, whose lower basin crosses Menemen plain to join the sea within the district boundaries still constitutes the lifeline of the region and matters relating to the river's flow as well as its present rate of rather high pollution is a matter of constant debate.\n\nEtymology\nThere are different accounts related to the historical origin of the Greek-derived name of \"Menemen\" (Μενεμένη or Μαινεμένη in Greek language). The most commonly encountered explanation based on the ancient Greek word mainómenos (μαινόμενος \"furious, raving, out of one's mind\"), which refers to a Greek Mythology story when Herakles went out of his mind for which Euripides wrote the play \"Herakles Mainomenos\" (). In addition, \"meneménos\" (μενεμένος) meant \"flood\" or \"overflow\". In  the absence of modern dams and other means of waterflow control in antiquity, the Hermos River (now Gediz River) used to cause serious and frequent damages in the valley until recent times. The river was nicknamed in Turkish \"Gediz the Sorceress\" (Cadı Gediz).\n\nOn the other hand, a minority of researchers discuss the possibility of a Luwian origin.\n\nIn any case, it is obvious, particularly in the light of recent discoveries made at the premises of Ege Fertilizer (Ege Gübre; the site being termed in the literature under the name of the industrial installations), at Araptepe and more particularly at Panaztepe and Menemen's Larissa, that settlement in the region extends far back in prehistoric times, at least until the late Neolithic and early Chalcolithic.\n\nSettlement and population\nWith a population of around 136,000, Menemen is the fifth most populous district in İzmir Province, in a ranking that includes İzmir's metropolitan municipalities and this indicates Menemen's degree of prominence within its province. Considering the district population stood at slight above a hundred thousand in 2000, it can be deducted that Menemen and especially the center town has a high rate of population increase. The determining factor in this increase was the immigration the region received from Turkey's Eastern Anatolia Region in the 2000s, especially from such towns as Bulanık, Karayazı, Malazgirt, Midyat, Diyadin, Patnos and Akyaka, Kars according to a report, cited below, prepared on the district.\n\nMenemen has, aside from the district center, eight settlements with their own municipalities. The number of depending villages displayed variations in recent times, a result of development and human movements among others, many former villages having been attached to the district center as its neighborhoods, and new villages having been officially constituted at localities where there were mere hamlets previously or some neighborhood saw their previous status of villages accorded back. The count stood at twenty villages at the end of 2005.\n\nThere are 22,100 residences in all in Menemen district. The number of pupils per teacher is 19 and the number of patients per doctor is 1,241.\n\nEconomy\nMenemen's yearly per capita income was calculated as 3870 US Dollars in 2006, slightly below the national average despite the region's fertility and its closeness to İzmir center, a rate which could partially be accounted by the high rate of migration Menemen received in recent decades especially from Eastern Anatolia. The district realized exports reaching ten million US Dollars in the same year. Much expected boost to Menemen's economy by the plastic products industrial zone is yet to materialize and the sales made by the district within and beyond Turkey still rely largely on a handful of agricultural and dairy products, such as dried tomatoes, dry raisins, pickled products and yogurt, and to two items of industrial products, namely leather and ceramics and other earthenware products. The total number of enterprises in Menemen was 10,723 the same year of 2006. Seven banks provide services through seven branches across Menemen district.\n\nUnderground riches include andesite, basalt and marble. Drinking water obtained from sources at Mount Yamanlar south of Menemen, and sold under brand names associated with the mountain are also very popular across İzmir region as a whole.\n\nComposition\nThere are 65 neighbourhoods in Menemen District:\n\n 29 Ekim\n Ahihıdır\n Alaniçi\n Asarlık Gölcük\n Asarlık İncirlipınar\n Asarlık Irmak\n Asarlık Yeşilpınar\n Asarlık Zeytinlik\n Atatürk\n Ayvacık\n Bağcılar\n Belen\n Bozalan\n Buruncuk\n Çaltı\n Camikebir\n Çavuş\n Çukurköy\n Doğa\n Emialem Değirmendere\n Emiralem Kır\n Emiralem Merkez\n Emiralem Yayla\n Esatpaşa\n Gaybi\n Gazi Mustafa Kemal\n Göktepe\n Görece\n Hasanlar\n Hatundere\n Haykıran\n İğnedere\n İsmet Inönü\n İstiklal\n Karaorman\n Kasımpaşa\n Kazımpaşa\n Kesik\n Koyundere Atatürk\n Koyundere Cumhuriyet\n Koyundere Gazi\n Koyundere Ulus\n Maltepe Cumhuriyet\n Mermerli\n Musabey\n Mustafa Kemal Atatürk\n Seydinasrullah\n Seyrek Cumhuriyet\n Seyrek Günerli\n Seyrek İnönü\n Seyrek Süzbeyli\n Seyrek Tuzçullu\n Seyrek Villakent\n Süleymanlı\n Telekler\n Tülbentli\n Turgutlar\n Türkelli Fatih\n Türkelli Yıldırım\n Uğur Mumcu\n Ulukent 30 Ağustos\n Ulukent Dokuz Eylül\n Yahşelli\n Yanıkköy\n Zafer\n\nTransportation\nMenemen is serviced by the E87 roadway, and is railroad is serviced by TCDD. The Menemen Railway Station has 7 passenger trains daily.\n\nSights of interest\nHistorical vestiges of Menemen occupy a small area in the old neighborhood of the town, marked by the recently restored Taşhan (literally the stone caravanserai) whose precise date of construction is unknown but is thought to have been built end-16th or early-17th century. A covered bazaar (bedesten) faces Taşhan and is still awaiting restoration. A few shrines-tombs in the Turkish style dating from mid-Ottoman centuries near Taşhan, two old mosques, a number of old houses, as well as the abandoned remains of what is likely to have been the town synagogue complete the picture. In nearby Hıdırtepe, slightly outside the popular quarter of Menemen characterized by low single-storeyed houses with gardens, typical for the climate of the plain, is another Ottoman shrine as well as the memorial area dedicated to Mustafa Fehmi Kubilay in a military zone open to visitors and occupying the summit of the hill, with tombs and a renowned high statue.\n\nHistory\nA late Bronze Age settlement in Panaztepe with a number of tholos tombs indicates an apparent Mycenaean influence. The first nucleus of Menemen was formed on the left bank of the River Gediz in the immediate vicinity of today's Yahşelli village. This settlement dates back to 1000 B.C. and is on the natural fluvial frontier between Ionia and Aeolia of antiquity. It is believed that the settlement was moved from its former place to today's Asarlık village between 263 and 241 B.C. and later to its actual place during the Turkish principalities era in Anatolia (13th-14th centuries).\n\nThe city was founded by Greek settlers and the region was first under Greek political influence and later came under the rule of Phrygian Kingdom. The region was taken over by the Lydians and their rule lasted between 676 and 546 B.C. until the commencement of the Persian rule in the western Anatolia after the defeat suffered by the Lydians in the face of the famous Persian King Cyrus.\n\nAs the Persian Empire collapsed after a series of definitive defeats against the Macedonians, the region became a part of Alexander's Empire. After Alexander's death in 323 B.C. Menemen and its environs had been ruled by the Pergamon Kingdom.\n\nIn 64 B.C. the region became a part of the Roman Empire. Later, with the division of the Roman territory into two independent states in 395 A.C., it came under the Byzantine rule with the rest of the eastern Roman provinces.\n\nWith the commencement of the Turkish rule in Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert (Malazgirt) (1071 A.C.), the region became a part of the Seljuk Empire in 1084 A.C. But the Seljuk rule was frequently interrupted by the Crusades which had a devastating influence on both Byzantine and Seljuk territories in Asia Minor.\n\nWith the decadence of Seljuks in the last quarter of the 13th century, local feudal lords had founded several principalities on the Anatolian territory. The Beylik of Saruhan, founded around Manisa, captured the site of Menemen together with Foça and its surroundings in 1313. At the moment of the Turkish conquest, Menemen didn't exist as a town: it was only the center of the domanial complex the aristocratic Byzantine family of Tarchaneiotes possessed in the area. But it seems that under the Saruhanoglu its emergence as a locality was relatively fast. As a reminder of its origin, this new locality was called Tarhaniyat, and this alternative name survived for a long time, as the Ottoman documentation shows, in particular census registers.\n\nBut the Saruhan rule on Menemen did not last too long as the new emerging power in Anatolia, the Ottomans took over the city in the last quarter of the 14th century during the reign of Bayezid I the Thunderbolt.\n\nAs Timur invaded Anatolia following the Battle of Ankara in 1402, the Ottoman state was dismembered and the Saruhan Principality took over the region once more until a definitive annexation to Ottoman territory in 1425 during the reign of Murad II.\n\nAt least under the end of the 18th century, Menemen was one of the important traditional centers of production of textiles and clothing in western Anatolia, advantaged by its location right in the middle of a region where cotton was cultivated in a large scale. Its fabrics, and particularly those called the \"demite\", \"demiton\" and \"escamite\" were much sought after, notably as export products in overseas markets \n\nFrom 1867 until 1922, Menemen was part of the Aydin Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire with its seat in İzmir.\n\nEarly 20th century\nIn 1914, the local Greek population in the area was affected by the violent ethnic cleansing campaign of the Ottoman state, while Ottoman irregular bands, Bashi-bazouks, some were Cretan Muslims, many of them were Muslim refugees, were looting and murdering local Greeks, looting villages south of Menemen. The CUP saw this as retaliation for the Muslims suffering under Greek domination since the Balkan wars (1912-1913), in which tens of thousands had left their homes. In Serekieuy, Menemen district, the Greek villagers were killed by these irregulars, after attempting to form some kind of resistance. A few escaped to the town of Menemen, which had a population of 20.000, the Bashi-bazouks shot who left the town but didn't attack the town itself.\n\nAfter World War I Greek troops landed at Smyrna and advanced inland during the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). After the battle at Bergama  retreating Greek army units managed to enter Menemen as part of the Greek occupation zone of Smyrna. However, they had to retreat temporarily from the town after fierce Turkish resistance during which excesses were committed by both sides. The subsequent massacre, on 17 June 1919, due to these developments, resulted in 200 Turkish civilians being killed and 200 others being wounded by the Greeks, while Turkish sources themselves claim 1000 dead. The events were protested by the Ottoman Sheikhulislam. The Greek military claimed that they were attacked in the town, on the other hand an Allied commission, after investigation, believed that their statements was not correct and found the Greeks alone responsible for the bloodshed, however they agreed that the massacre was not organized by the Greek Command, but was as a result of the panic and anger of the young Greek troops who were still affected by the Bergama events and whom their officers were not able to calm.\n\nThe city was recaptured, three years later on 9 September 1922 by the Turkish Army, during the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922). The Greek inhabitants of the town had to leave Menemen late in 1923 and in 1924 under the agreement for the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations between the two countries according to which Turkish immigrants from different parts of Greece were later lodged in town.\n\nMenemen Incident\n\nOn December 23, 1930, Dervish Mehmed, a Cretan Muslim Sufi and self-proclaimed prophet, arrived in Menemen with six followers in an attempt to incite rebellion against the secular government and reestablish Islamic law. Mehmed and his enthusiastic supporters overwhelmed the local army garrison and killed the commander, Lieutenant Mustafa Fehmi Kubilay. Kubilay's severed head was put on a pole and paraded through the town. The army soon regained control, killing Mehmed and several of his followers.\n\nThe young Turkish Republic considered the incident a serious threat against secular reform. After a series of trials, 37 people were sentenced to death and later hanged in the town square; and several others were sent to prison. In 1932 a monument was erected in Menemen to commemorate the incident.\n\n21st century\n\nIn May 2015, the Greek Church \"Agios Konstantinos\" has reopened and held a mass for first time in 93 years.\n\nNotable people\n Attilâ İlhan\n Çağlar Söyüncü\n Harun Tekin\n Kaymakam Kemal Bey\n\nTwinnings\n Menemeni, a suburb in Thessaloniki\n\nSee also\nMenemen Gediz Bridge\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \nMenemen Free Zone\n\nFurther reading\n\n \n Irène Beldiceanu-Steinherr, Thierry Ganchou, Tarhaniyat / Menemen.

He was born in the village of Nabagram in Laud (in present-day Sunamganj District, Bangladesh), in 1434, some fifty years before Chaitanya, and spent most of his adult life in the town of Shantipur in Nadia with his wife and family. Advaita Acharya had six sons, Acyutananda Das (who also became a disciple of Chaitanya), Krisna Mishra, Gopala Das, Balarama Das Mishra (whose lineage became the zamindar of Krishna Chandra), Swarupa Das and Jagadisa Mishra.\n\nAdvaita Acharya contributed in two Sanskrit literature, named Yogabashishta-Bhaishta and Geeta Bhaishya. The ancestry and life of Advaita Acharya are narrated in a number of hagiographical works, which include the Balyalila-Sutra (1487?) of Krishnadasa in Sanskrit and the Advaitasutrakadacha of Krishnadasa, the Advaitamangala of Haricharanadasa, the  Advaitaprakasha of Ishana Nagara and the Advaitavilasa of Naraharidasa in Bengali. Many of his activities are described in the Chaitanya Charitamrta, the Chaitanya Mangala and the Chaitanya Bhagavata.\n\nLife story \n\nAdvaita Acharya was the son of Kubera Acharya. Kubera was the courtier of Divya Singh, the King of Laur. Kubera's father was Narsingha who was the minister of King Ganesha of Nadiyal.\n\nIn his latter years, Advaita Acharya became increasingly saddened by the pursuit of materialistic goals that, he believed, lead to a dysfunctional, unhappy society and concluded that the only solution was to offer prayers, begging his Supreme Lord Krishna to come as an Avatar and attract people back to the joy of the spiritual life. Advaita Acharya is said to have prayed for several months, crying out and worshiping him in the form of his Shaligram Shila with sacred Tulasi leaves and Ganges water. At the end of thirteen months during an eclipse of the full moon, his prayers were answered when Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was born.\nIt was also Advaita Acharya who first proclaimed Chaitanya to be God Himself by reciting the Vedic text 'namo brahmanya devāya go-brāhmaṇa hitāya ca jagaddhitāya kṛṣṇāya govindāya namo namaḥ' 'I salute Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, the god of brāhmaṇas who benefits cows and brāhmaṇas and the whole world.'\nHe is known to have been a close friend of both Chaitanya and Nityananda in their mission of spreading the Hare Krishna mantra. Advaita Acharya's abode was the first place where Chaitanya took alms, and this is where He told Chaitanya \"Wherever you are is .\" \nOn the day marking his birth members hold a celebration in his honour and read and discuss stories of his life.\n\nDescendants of Advaita Acharya \nHe has many lineages from two of his children.  Bijoy Krishna Goswami falls under one lineage.

He previously served as the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks, New York Jets, St. Louis Rams and the University of Georgia and also served as an assistant  coach for the Washington Redskins, San Diego Chargers,  Indianapolis Colts, and Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\nEarly years \nSchottenheimer was born in Denver, Colorado.  He prepped at Blue Valley High School in Overland Park, Kansas, where he quarterbacked his team to the Kansas Class 5A state football championship in 1991, while earning first-team all-state and honorable mention high school All-American honors.  He threw for 2,586 yards and 26 touchdowns in his career. His success at Blue Valley High School led to a scholarship for the University of Kansas.\n\nPlaying career\n\nCollege\nSchottenheimer first attended the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas, where he was a member of the Kansas Jayhawks football team for a single season in 1992 serving as a backup to starting quarterback Chip Hilleary.  He transferred to the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, sat out a year as required by NCAA transfer rules, and then played for coach Steve Spurrier's Florida Gators football team from 1994 to 1996.  Schottenheimer served as backup to starting quarterback Danny Wuerffel, and was a member of the Gators' 1996 Bowl Alliance national championship team.  During his college playing career, he completed twenty-five of thirty-eight passes (65.8%) for 290 yards and two touchdowns, and also ran for a touchdown.\n\nSchottenheimer graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in exercise and sports science in 1997.\n\nCoaching career\n\nEarly career\nSchottenheimer was an assistant coach from 1997 to 2005 with the St. Louis Rams, Kansas City Chiefs, Syracuse Orange, and USC Trojans, including as quarterback coach for the Washington Redskins and San Diego Chargers. He was an assistant under his father, Marty Schottenheimer, in three of those coaching positions: Kansas City Chiefs, Washington Redskins, and San Diego Chargers.\n\nNew York Jets\nIn 2006, he became offensive coordinator for the New York Jets and, in early 2007, Schottenheimer's name was floated around as being a possible replacement for the departed Nick Saban as the Miami Dolphins head coach. He later removed his name from consideration for the Dolphins head coaching position, preferring to stay with the New York Jets.\n\nAfter the 2008 NFL season, when Jets coach Eric Mangini was fired, Schottenheimer was one of the first candidates interviewed for the open head coaching position. However, he eventually lost out to Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan. On January 13, 2010, Schottenheimer announced that he was staying with the Jets as offensive coordinator and would not interview for the head coaching vacancy in Buffalo.\n\nSt. Louis Rams\nOn January 10, 2012, Schottenheimer announced he would not return to the Jets for the 2012 season. On January 21, 2012, Schottenheimer became the offensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams.\n\nGeorgia\nOn January 7, 2015, it was announced that Schottenheimer would take over as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for the Georgia Bulldogs football team of the University of Georgia, under head coach Mark Richt.  Following Richt's firing at the end of the 2015 season, Schottenheimer announced on December 14 to his position players that he would not return as a Georgia Bulldogs assistant coach in 2016.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\nOn January 18, 2016, the Indianapolis Colts announced that they had hired Schottenheimer as their quarterbacks coach.\n\nSeattle Seahawks\nOn January 15, 2018, the Seattle Seahawks announced that they had hired Schottenheimer as their offensive coordinator. The Seahawks went on to have the leagues top rushing offense for the 2018 season and quarterback Russell Wilson had a career high 110.9 passer rating.\n\nOn January 12, 2021, Schottenheimer was fired by the Seahawks following the Seahawks' Wild Card loss to the Los Angeles Rams due to \"philosophical differences\". Despite a torrid start to the 2020 season which saw career highs for quarterback Russell Wilson in touchdowns and completion percentage, Seattle's offense struggled considerably during the final weeks, with Schottenheimer taking the brunt of the scrutiny due to lack of creativity in the offense and adjustments to the scheme. Regardless, the Seahawks set their franchise record for points scored in a season with 459.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\nOn February 1, 2021, Schottenheimer was hired by the Jacksonville Jaguars as their passing game coordinator under head coach Urban Meyer.\n\nOn February 8, 2022, upon the Jaguars hiring of Doug Pederson as the head coach, Schottenheimer was not retained on the coaching staff.\n\nDallas Cowboys \nOn March 24, 2022, Schottenheimer was hired by the Dallas Cowboys as a consultant. He was promoted to offensive coordinator on February 4, 2023.\n\nPersonal life\nSchottenheimer is the son of the late Marty Schottenheimer, who had been the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, Washington Redskins, San Diego Chargers, and Kansas City Chiefs and his uncle, Kurt Schottenheimer, was also the defensive backs coach and defensive coordinator for the Chiefs. In addition to coaching, Schottenheimer is a frequent contributor to The 33rd Team, which describes itself as a \"football Think Tank.\"\n\nReferences\n\n1973 births\nLiving people\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nDallas Cowboys coaches\nFlorida Gators football players\nGeorgia Bulldogs football coaches\nIndianapolis Colts coaches\nJacksonville Jaguars coaches\nKansas City Chiefs coaches\nKansas Jayhawks football players\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nNew York Jets coaches\nPlayers of American football from Denver\nSan Diego Chargers coaches\nSeattle Seahawks coaches\nSportspeople from Denver\nSt. Louis Rams coaches\nUSC Trojans football coaches\nWashington Redskins coaches"}

{"id": "4105727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midyat", "title": "Midyat", "text": "Midyat (, , , ) is a municipality and district of Mardin Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,241 km2, and its population is 120,069 (2022).\n\nIn the modern era, the town is populated by Assyrians, Kurds and Mhallami people. The old Estel neighborhood is about 80 to 85% Kurdish-populated.\n\nHistory\nAssyrian tablets from 9th century BC refer to Midyat as Matiate. During a campaign in 879 BC, the Assyrian king Assurnasirpal II and his army marched through the city, staying for two nights. His successor, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III did the same in 845 BC. The tablets also described how Assurnasirpal II erected a monument in the city, which remains to be found. The archaeological site Matiate is located below the town and is assumed to have been in use for about 1,900 years and at its peak been inhabited by up to 70,000 people.\n\nThe leading Assyrian  Syriac Orthodox family, the Safars, were highly placed in the Deksuri confederation, while other local Assyrians were aligned with the opposing, anti-government Heverkan confederation. In mid-1915, Assyrian Christians in Midyat considered resistance after hearing about massacres elsewhere, but the local Syriac Orthodox community initially refused to support this. Hanne Safar Pasha was persuaded to break with other Christian leaders who wanted to organize an uprising in Midyat. Shortly thereafter, Safar was killed after all male members of the pacifist Protestant Hermez family. In late June, kaymakam Nuri Bey disappeared, likely executed by Mehmed Reshid after refusing to massacre local Christians. On 21 June, 100 Christian men (mostly Armenians and Assyrian Protestants) were arrested, tortured for confessions implicating others, and executed outside the city; this panicked the Assyrian population. Local people refused to hand over their arms, attacked government offices, and cut telegraph lines; local Arab and Kurdish tribes were recruited by the Ottoman government to attack the Christians. The town was pacified in early August after weeks of bloody urban warfare which killed hundreds of Christians (Assyrians and Armenians). Survivors fled east to the more-defensible Iwardo, which held out successfully with the food aid of local Yazidis.\n\nDemographics\n\nMidyat, in Diyarbekir vilayet, was the only town in the Ottoman Empire with an ethnic Assyrian majority, although denominationally divided between the  Syriac Orthodox Church, Chaldean Catholic Church, and Assyrian Protestants.\n\nOn the eve of the First World War, various sources report a total population of about 8,000 people. Most of them being Syriac-Orthodox Christians, plus some Protestants, Syriac-Catholics, Chaldeans, Armenians, and Muslims (mostly Kurds). The Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate of Constantinople recorded 1,452 Armenians in the kaza of Midyat before the First World War.\n\nMidyat is an historic centre of the Assyrian in Turkey, and as late as the Assyrian genocide in 1915 they constituted the majority of the city's population. During the early 20th century, the Assyrian population of the city started to gradually diminish due to emigration, but the community was still very large. The Assyrian of Tur Abdin were the only significant population of Christians outside of Istanbul, until 1979, when panic ensued over an act of war and an exodus of local Christians overtook the city as a result, because a mayor and major Assyrian figure in Turabdin of the city of Kerboran, now named Dargecit, was assassinated and replaced with a Kurdish representative against the peoples will. The Assyrian up until then had control over the local government, and could therefore unify to resist threats. Panic ensued as the local Muslim population made a symbolic declaration of war against the Assyrian people and soon after the takeover, local Mhallami and Kurdish inhabitants started immigrating into the traditionally Assyrian areas, causing a demographic shift which – along with the start of the Turkey-PKK conflict a few years later in 1984 – sounded a death toll to the community not only here, but in all of Tur Abdin. From a 1975 population of 50,000 comprising 10% of Mardin Province's demographic structure: barely 2,000 were left by the end of the conflict in 1999. Now only around 3–5,000 live in Tur Abdin, with the other 15–17,000 living in Istanbul and other still functioning Syriac Diocese like Adiyaman, Harput, and Diyarbakir.\n\nThe churches and houses belonging to the Christians have been preserved although many of them are empty, with their owners living away in Europe. At present 500 Assyrian Christians live in Midyat, and they have been joined by 100–300 Syriac refugees fleeing the Syrian Civil War who have settled in the city and region according to different estimates, and comprise 1% of the population of Midyat. There are five churches in the city, and all are Syriac.\n\nComposition\nThere are 72 neighbourhoods in Midyat District. Twelve of these (Akçakaya, Bağlar, Bahçelievler, Cumhuriyet, Gölcük, Işıklar, Ortaçarşı, Sanayi, Seyitler, Ulucamii, Yenimahalle and Yunus Emre) form the central town (merkez) of Midyat.\n\n Acırlı ()\n Adaklı ()\n Akçakaya\n Altıntaş (, )\n Anıtlı ()\n Bağlar\n Bağlarbaşı ()\n Bahçelievler\n Bardakçı ()\n Barıştepe ()\n Başyurt ()\n Bethkustan \n Budaklı ()\n Çaldere ()\n Çalpınar ()\n Çamyurt ()\n Çandarlı ()\n Çavuşlu ()\n Çayırlı ()\n Cumhuriyet\n Danışman ()\n Doğançay (, )\n Doğanyazı ()\n Dolunay ()\n Düzgeçit (Zernoka)\n Düzoba ()\n Eğlence (Zinol)\n Elbeğendi ()\n Erişti (Tafo)\n Gelinkaya ()\n Gölcük\n Gülgoze ()\n Gülveren ()\n Güngören ()\n Güven ()\n Hanlar ()\n Harmanlı ()\n İkizdere ()\n Işıklar\n Izbırak ()\n Kayabaşı ()\n Kayalar ()\n Kayalıpınar ()\n Kutlubey ()\n Mercimekli (Hapsenas)\n Narlı ()\n Ortaca ()\n Ortaçarşı\n Oyuklu ()\n Pelitli (Barbunus)\n Sanayi\n Sarıkaya (Haldeh)\n Sarıköy ()\n Şenköy (\n Seyitler\n Sivrice ()\n Söğütlü ()\n Taşlıburç ()\n Tepeli ()\n Toptepe ()\n Tulgalı ()\n Üçağıl ()\n Ulucamii\n Yayvantepe ()\n Yemişli (, )\n Yenice ()\n Yenimahalle\n Yeşilöz ()\n Yolbaşı (, )\n Yunus Emre\n Yuvalı ()\n Ziyaret\n\nEconomy\n\nMidyat is the regional center of commerce for the district, and is one of the largest cities in Mardin Province. Similarly with Mardin, the city is known for its Syriac handicrafts such as carpets, towels and other cloth goods. More specific to the city is its Syriac silver crafts called telkari, which are handcrafted filigreed ornaments. To the east of the city there is a winery that makes traditional Syriac wine: a wine native to the region. Another staple in the Midyat market is its bulgur, which is a cereal food derived from wheat.\n\nClimate\nMidyat, part of the province of Mardin, has a semi-arid climate with very hot and dry summers and cold, wet, and occasionally snowy winters. Temperatures in summer usually increase to 40 °C – 50 °C (104 °F – 122 °F) due to Mardin being situated right next to the border with Syria. Snowfall is quite common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two. Mardin has over 3,000 hours of sun per year. The highest recorded temperature is 48.8 °C.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n Study on the spoken Arabic of Midyat, in the Arabic language\n\n \nPopulated places in Mardin Province\nDistricts of Mardin Province\nMetropolitan district municipalities in Turkey\nTur Abdin\nAssyrian communities in Turkey\nPlaces of the Assyrian genocide\nMhallami\nKurdish settlements in Mardin Province\nFormer Armenian communities in Mardin Province\nFormer Yazidi communities in Turkey"}

It is the seat of Mudurnu District. Its population is 5,379 (2021). The mayor is Necdet Türker (MHP), elected in 2019.\n\nHistory\nThe town has a long history and the name Mudurnu comes from the Byzantine princess Modrene (Μωδρηνή in Byzantine Greek), and the ruins of the Byzantine castle can still be seen above the town. In the 8th century AD, the forces of the Byzantine usurper Artabasdos, commanded by his son Niketas, were defeated at or near this location by the army of the legitimate emperor Constantine V, before being defeated again at Chrysopolis, the same location where Constantine the Great defeated his Eastern rival Licinius.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Mudurnu was part of the Kastamonu Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThis is an attractive district of forest and mountain. Mudurnu itself is a historical town with a number of well-preserved Ottoman Empire period houses. A portion of the centre of town has been declared an Historic Preservation District (\"Kentsel Sit Alanı\").\n\nIn 1920, during the Nationalists' push to gain control over the country, İbrahim Çolak with the Kuva-yi Milliye besieged forces loyal to the Porte for three days, May 13 to 15, before taking the town.\n\nEconomy\nUntil 2002 when it went bankrupt, the local economy was heavily dependent on the \"Mudurnu Chicken\" (Mudurnu Tavuk) company, one of Turkey's largest poultry producers and fast-food chains.  There is a large statue of a chicken at the edge of town. After the chicken processing plant closed in 2002, significant numbers of people left the town for jobs elsewhere and the remaining populace began to invest in tidying up and restoring the old town in order to attract tourists and weekend visitors. Many of the old houses are now restaurants serving local cuisine.\n\nIn 2007 as part of the dissolution of Mudurnu Chicken the brand name was sold to Pak Chicken (Pak Tavuk), who produced chicken under that brand name, but not in Mudurnu. Beginning in 2010 Pak Chicken opened a chicken packing plant in Mudurnu, employing 350 people by mid 2010.\n\nPlaces of interest\n Babas Kaplıcası - mineral water spring with accommodation in a restored Ottoman wooden bathhouse.\n Yildrim Bayezid Mosque - built in 1372 as part of a complex of dervish lodges, the hamam and madrasha.

{"id": "4105772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsotsitaal%20and%20Camtho", "title": "Tsotsitaal and Camtho", "text": "Tsotsitaal is a vernacular derived from a variety of mixed languages mainly spoken in the townships of Gauteng province (such as Soweto), but also in other agglomerations all over South Africa. Tsotsi is a Sesotho, Pedi or Tswana slang word for a \"thug\" or \"robber\" or \"criminal\", possibly from the verb \"ho lotsa\" \"to sharpen\", whose meaning has been modified in modern times to include \"to con\"; or from the tsetse fly, as the language was first known as Flytaal, although flaai also means \"cool\" or \"street smart\". The word taal in Afrikaans means  \"language\".\n\nA tsotsitaal is built over the grammar of one or several languages, in which terms from other languages or specific terms created by the community of speakers are added. It is a permanent work of language-mix, language-switch, and terms-coining.\n\nHistory\nThe tsotsitaal phenomenon originates with one variety known as Flaaitaal or Flytaal, and then Tsotsitaal, which became popular under this latter name in the freehold township of Sophiatown, west of Johannesburg, in the 1940s and 1950s. Tsotsitaal, the original variety, is based on Afrikaans, in which were originally added Tswana terms, and later terms from Zulu and other South African languages. Tsotsitaal spread first as a criminal language, as it had the power of insuring secrecy in the speech: only criminals at first could understand it.\n\nLater, as a prestigious sign of rebellion against the state and its police, and as gangsters were admired by youths who would see in them examples of success, Tsotsitaal became a youth and street language. At the time, it would exceptionally be heard in households, as tradition did not allow a gangster language to be used in the house. But it quickly became a symbol of the ethnically, culturally, and linguistically mixed culture of Sophiatown. Tsotsitaal is now a moribund variety in the black townships, as its speakers are mainly above the age of 70. However, it has maintained in slightly different forms as a prison language and among the black communities who are Afrikaans-speaking.\n\nFrom the original Tsotsitaal, the noun tsotsitaal came to refer to any gang or street language in South Africa. However, the specific variety behind the term would depend on the languages actually present in the specific urban environment were one tsotsitaal appears. The most important tsotsitaal nowadays in South Africa is the one from the township of Soweto, the largest township and the place which shows the most diverse linguistic setting in the country.\n\nIt was originally known as Iscamtho or Isicamtho (from Zulu, it is a combination of the class 7 prefix isi- here representing language — see Noun classes in Zulu; with a derivation of ukuqamunda [uk’u!amunda], meaning 'to talk volubly'), but it is now more often referred to as Ringas (from English ringers, as in people forming a ring to chat). Other alternative names are Isitsoti or Setsotsi ('the tsotsi language' in Zulu or Sotho), Sekasi (the township language, from the Iscamtho word kasi 'township', itself derived from Afrikaans lokasie), or simply i-taal 'the language'.\n\nHowever, Iscamtho is quite different from the original Tsotsitaal. It originates in a different criminal argot created in the 1920s by the AmaLaita gang and known as Shalambombo. It is not based on Afrikaans, but on Bantu grammars, mainly Zulu and Sotho. The Zulu-based and Sotho-based varieties are the most widespread in Soweto, but one can actually build Iscamtho over any grammar of the South African Bantu languages, such as Xhosa, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda and others. But as Zulu is the dominant language in Soweto, and as Sotho in Soweto often unifies Sesotho, Setswana and Sepedi in one single variety and is the second most popular language in the township, Iscamtho is more often used \"in\" Zulu or \"in\" Sotho.\n\nTsotsitaal has been a model for Iscamtho, due to the cultural prestige of Sophiatown. But the youth abandoned it in the 1970s, when Afrikaans came to be no more associated with the power of the state, as it had been so far, but was recognized as the language of apartheid and oppression (especially after the 1976 Soweto Uprising). Iscamtho then became the one youth language in Soweto.\n\nStructure\nA number of Afrikaans terms from Tsotsitaal have maintained in Iscamtho (such as niks, vandag, goed, maat,\"daso\", \"darr\", vrou, vriendin, mooi). Also, the taste of Tsotsitaal-speakers for word transformation, language-mixing and word creation has been transmitted to Iscamtho speakers. Thus, linguistic creativity is the main characteristic of the speakers of the Sowetan language. And although it has different varieties, Iscamtho carries a single identity for all of its speakers, who recognize it as one variety, whatever form it takes.\n\nThis is due to the way the language operates: from one grammar which serves as a matrix, the speaker adds words from other languages (including English, Afrikaans, and different Bantu languages) or typically Iscamtho words. One can also create words by modifying existing ones or by coining completely new terms. Thus, Iscamtho and other tsotsitaals experience continuous evolution. Sometimes, new terms made famous by prominent artists can spread extremely quickly and replace older terms.\n\nIscamtho and Tsotsitaal are very similar in form and in the material which forms their vocabulary. But since the seventies and for political reasons, the use of Afrikaans as a matrix has been excluded in Iscamtho. Due to the popularity of Soweto among Black South African youth, and due also to the importance of Soweto-based artists in the foremost post-apartheid culture, kwaito, Iscamtho has been spreading to other township youths in the country, and different tsotsitaals have been enriched with typically Iscamtho material. Thus a form of \"standardization\" of tsotsitaals around the norm of Iscamtho might be on its way. This is largely the consequence of the presence of Iscamtho on the radio (through music but also because many national radios are based in Soweto and Johannesburg), on television (in series and entertainment shows) and in the kwaito culture.\n\nSocial meaning\nAs a gangster language, Tsotsitaal originally was a male-only language. The same applies to Iscamtho. A female speaker would then be identified as either a gangster's girlfriend or a prostitute. For male speakers however, the language quickly acquired a meaning of city-slickness and street-wisdom, and mastering it was the proof that one knew the urban environment well enough to cope and not be threatened. However, as Tsotsitaal became the symbol of the cultural life of Sophiatown (before the area was cleared of its residents in the mid-1950s) it was adopted by a number of women. But only the most independent and self-affirmed women would then become Tsotsitaal-speakers.\n\nDue to the importance of gangsterism in Soweto over about four decades and due to the large numbers of Sowetan youths who experienced prison for criminal or political activities in the last two decades of apartheid, the status of Iscamtho changed: from a street language, it became the main language of most youths, started to be spoken within households among the youths, and then between the youths and adults. In the course of the 1980s for the latest, Iscamtho reached the status of mother language for thousands of Sowetan youths, meaning that children learnt Iscamtho in the cradle from their parents along with their family's other languages. Today, the distinction between Iscamtho and urban Zulu or urban Sotho in Soweto tends to be thinner as hundreds of thousands of youths actually speak Iscamtho as a first language.\n\nIn addition, a post-apartheid evolution has been the adoption of Iscamtho and other tsotsitaals by many female speakers. Especially, many girls in deep Soweto now have Iscamtho as (one of) their native language(s). Iscamtho as a symbol of youth, city-slickness and the multilingualism of the South African democracy (each language is represented in Iscamtho) has become a language proper for both male and female speakers despite some remaining conservative behaviours and considerations towards female speakers. Especially among the younger lesbian community. Iscamtho is often used as a strong identity marker, and many young lesbians appreciate it and use it as their main language.\n\nIscamtho has also become a language used in exchanges with older people, who previously would have been offended to be addressed to in the tsotsi language. But as native speakers of Iscamtho refuse to be discriminated against, they often impose their language in exchanges, and consider it as respectful as any other.\n\nIscamtho in the media\nAfter the abolition of apartheid in South Africa in 1994, kwaito, already a popular music form in South Africa, and its artists came to embrace the use of tsotsitaal in lyrical content. Because they are associated with urban thugs and the criminal subculture, tsotsitaals and Iscamtho are seen by many as a South African form of gangsta slang. However, the language is more than a mere slang, and is referred to by its speakers as \"our language\". With the advent of rising middle-class and elite Blacks in South Africa after apartheid and the significance of gold to the South African history and culture, the attitudes prevalent in kwaito music appropriate gold to notions of success and wealth. Because of their urban nature and form, tsotsitaals came to be emblematic of the attitudes of post-apartheid South African black poor youth that were largely apolitical, concerned mainly with a representation of success and wealth.\n\nToday, kwaito music using tsotsitaal and more especially Iscamtho can be heard on national radio stations such as YFM (for Youth FM). Some prominent artists such as Zola7 speak Iscamtho when they appear in the media (Zola7 especially has its own regular TV show). Iscamtho is also used in advertisement, for all products which aim at the youths. Finally, Iscamtho has spread on television, through youth programs such as series (especially Yizo Yizo), soapies (Rhythm City or Generations) and entertainment shows. From 2007, a local television station opened in Orlando West, Soweto. Called SowetoTV, this station uses Iscamtho as one of its main languages, together with English, Zulu and Sotho. A number of programs for the youths are in Iscamtho only, such as Dlalangeringas (which means “Let's speak Iscamtho”).\n\nThrough the media, and considering the symbolic power of Soweto over black township youths, Iscamtho is influencing young speakers of tsotsitaals in South Africa, and many adopt the words or expressions  they discover on television or in kwaito. Thus, Iscamtho directly influences and reshapes local tsotsitaals.\n\nNative Iscamtho-speaking communities\nNowadays in Soweto, possibly up to 500,000 youths speak Iscamtho as their main language or one of their main languages. Some of them have learnt it from birth, and master Iscamtho better than any other language. As the South African Constitution provides for everyone to be educated in his/her native language, linguistic problems in the educational system are an important issue in Soweto: children considered by the authorities as being Zulu- or Sotho-speakers are educated in those languages. But the languages used at school are the standard ones. As a result, many pupils face comprehension problems, as they don't really know those rural standards. Some can miss up to 30% of the information which they receive. And teachers are so far not allowed to use Iscamtho, although many of them do it informally.\n\nAlso, the issue of language in the judicial system suffers from the non-recognition of Iscamtho. South African citizens have the right to be tried in their language, but dispositions are only provided for the 11 official languages of the country. As a consequence, first-language Iscamtho-speakers face inequalities compared to the rest of the population, as they might be tried in a language which is not the one they master best. On the contrary, when trying to use “their” language at court, they rarely have the opportunity to be supported by a translator who can understand this language, as translators are recruited for their competence in one or more of the 11 official languages.\n\nOne should consider that what occurs with native Iscamtho-speaking communities can also be applied to other tsotsitaal speaking communities in South Africa, in the Black townships as well as in the Coloured townships, where Afrikaans-speaking populations have their own tsotsitaals.\n\nMore often than not, when celebrated in the media capacity or space, tsotsi taal speakers are presented in a manner in which the older generations of such a culture would be described; fairly violent, conniving and restless. This kind of media portrayal usually spreads the logic; like all marginalized and unofficial languages; that there is not or cannot be a voice of reason, intelligence, love or even respect among its speakers. This then, may just be the reason as to why the language is being unrecognized by many communities and institutions. There is however a very distinct level of respect accompanied by the language that many may not understand. When a fellow tsotsi taal speaker sees and meets another; a very profound sense of respect and belonging can be witnessed. The term \"ka\" followed by what the western world would normally call a fist bump was traditionally a shortened versioned term for \"kasi\" meaning township - a proud expression indicating where one was from - the townships.\n\nSee also\nHistorical dialects of Afrikaans\nTsotsi, winner of the 2005 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.\nThe Suit (2016 film), a short film directed by Jarryd Coetsee, set in 1950s Sophiatown.\nMapantsula, a 1988 film directed by Oliver Schmitz.\nFanagalo\nPretoria Sotho\n\nNotes\n\nRelevant reading\n\nAycard, P. 2008.

The founder, Willy Randin, former director of the hospital, and Maurice Lack, an architect specializing in bioclimatics, proposed a project based on renewable sources of energy. Research was conducted in this direction, but the people in charge of the Albert Schweitzer hospital were not interested by the project. Instead of simply abandoning their ideas, Lack and Randin wanted to develop the appropriate technologies with interested people in other parts of the world. To do this, they founded the Albert Schweitzer Ecological Centre (CEAS) and the Sahel Action of Schweitzer's Work, Nouvelle Planète, in Switzerland.\n\nAt the time, Willy Randin was working for a big development agency in Switzerland, and he had been able to see the extent to which citizens had the desire to understand the reality of Southern countries, and to mobilize themselves in view of backing small projects by establishing direct relations with the beneficiaries.\n\nIn 1986, given the success of Sahel Action of Schweitzer's Work, it was decided to extend activities to Haiti, then to the Amazon, while continuing with Sahel-based projects with the CEAS. At that point, the name of the organization was changed to Nouvelle Planète.\n\nPhilosophy\nNouvelle Planète is based on the ethics of Albert Schweitzer, who said: I am life wanting to live with life that wants to live. This ethical position implies a respect for all forms of life inasmuch as it is possible; a balance between humans, animals and plants ensues.\n\nNouvelle Planète embraces political, economic and religious neutrality. It works with groups in the South and the North, starting from their own initiatives, from their knowledge and their know-how.\n\nThe organization feels that the problems of human development and ecology have never been worse, the gap between rich and poor countries has never been greater, and misunderstanding of these problems is growing.\nPeople in northern countries have difficulty mobilizing themselves and demonstrating solidarity with those in need.

It incorporated by Royal Charter in 1931 and opened in 1935. Its first director was Edinburgh Medical School graduate Francis Richard Fraser. It was the result of recommendations by the Athlone Report of 1921, and was a pioneer institution of postgraduate clinical teaching and research. The school had always been closely linked with the Hammersmith Hospital and the Medical Research Council, where its teaching research and clinical work were carried out. Senior academic staff of the school provided consultant services and academic leadership for Hammersmith Hospital. The RPMS has had an enormous influence on British medicine and had a major role in developing endocrine surgery in the UK.\n\nThe school became part of the British Postgraduate Medical Federation in 1947, and was known as the Postgraduate Medical School of London. In 1974 the school became independent, with a new charter and the title Royal Postgraduate Medical School. Its separate status ended in 1997 with its assimilation into Imperial College London.

This was a period of rapid climatic transitions around the North Atlantic, some of which took place during a matter of decades. Similar effects are evident in independent palaeoclimatic reconstructions obtained from pollen zones, marine and ice-core records, but these sequences cannot be reliably calibrated with one another. The ash layer from a specific volcanic event, deposited simultaneously over wide areas, provides a common reference point or time marker called a horizon, which establishes simultaneity in the sequences wherever that layer is found: this set of techniques is called tephrochronology. \n\nRadiocarbon dating establishes a date for the Saksunarvatn tephra of ca 10.200 years BP calibrated, during the late Pre-Boreal climatic phase of rapid warming. The volcanic event happened on Iceland. The name commemorates the site where the ash layer was initially recognized, Lake Saksunarvatn on the island of Streymoy in the Faroe Islands, described by Waagstein and Johansen, 1968.\n\nReferences\nInternational Arctic Workshop, 2004.

South Caicos is known for excellent fishing, both deep-sea and bone fishing, and scuba diving. South Caicos was formerly a salt exporter, the island still hosts a network of salt pans as a reminder of the industry. Today, the island's main income is derived from small-scale commercial fishing.\n\nThe School for Field Studies, a global nonprofit, accredited by the University of Minnesota, has established a well-regarded Center for Marine Resource Studies in Cockburn Harbour. The Centre's research focuses on marine ecology and natural resource management.  The island hosts an Annual South Caicos Regatta, a large celebration that features parties, boat races, and other games. Though there is some real estate development, tourism is, currently, virtually nonexistent on South Caicos.\n\nGeography\nThe island is  west of Grand Turk. Bell Sound is at the western side of the island, providing an important fishing site. Together with uninhabited East Caicos and a number of smaller islands, it forms the South Caicos and East Caicos District, with a total area of . All islands in the east and south of Caicos Bank belong to this district, except French Cay, which belongs to Providenciales and West Caicos. The larger ones of these islands are Hog Cay (), McCartney Cay (), Little Ambergris Cay (), Big Ambergris Cay (), and Long Cay (immediately south of South Caicos, ). Between South Cacios and the Amgergris Cays are the Six Hill Cays () and the Fish Cays (). South of the Ambergris Cays are Bush Cay (), Pear Cay (), Shot Cay (), White Cay (), South Rock, Whale Breaker, and Swimmer Rock (submerged), and southwest, West Sand Spit (submerged). The cays from Bush Cay to White Cay are the Seal Cays. South Rock is submerged, with a depth of less than  above it.\n\nHistory\nSouth Caicos may have been the second island sighted by Christopher Columbus. The original inhabitants of the island were Taíno and Lucayan Indians. In addition to a variety of archaeological treasures, they left behind the names of the islands in the form of the indigenous \"Turk's head\" cactus and the Lucayan term “caya hico” meaning string of islands named Caicos. The Lucayans disappeared roughly 30 years after his arrival, leaving the island sparsely populated and the salt industry booming.\n\nThe French and Spanish briefly captured the island in 1706 during which time it became a pirate haven. Until a fungus outbreak killed them off, sea-sponge farming briefly flourished on the island during the 1930s. The United States built an anti-submarine base on South Caicos in 1944, along with the first airstrip in the archipelago. During the 1950s a Canadian businessman attempted to start a conch shell export business on the island. In 1959 the U.S. returned to South Caicos when the Coast Guard constructed a LORAN (low-frequency radio signal navigation) station on the island. Today the island attracts tourists drawn to its unspoiled coral reefs.\n\nPopulation\nThe population of South Caicos Island was estimated at 1,139 in 2012.\n\nVillages on South Caicos\n Out North\n The Flat\n Highlands\n\nCockburn Harbour \nNamed in 1840 after an official visit by a Governor of the Bahamas – Sir Francis Cockburn – Cockburn Harbour is the largest settlement on South Caicos Island and is home to some 900 year-round residents. Cockburn Harbour is known for having the best natural harbour in the Turks and Caicos Islands.  Until the 1960s it was an important centre of regional trade and a major exporter of salt. Today its main industry is small-scale fishing focused on conch and spiny lobster exports. A variety of historic structures, including the Queen's Parade Grounds, an old Wesleyan Church, the 18th-century Commissioner's House, the old saltworks and the boiling hole that fed them can be found in the town. The abandoned salt pans just outside town have become the home of a number of bird species including large flocks of flamingos.\n\nEducation\nMarjorie Basden High School is in South Caicos.\n\nImages\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n South Caicos at TCIMall\n South Caicos - Visit Turks and Caicos Islands\n\nCaicos Islands"}

His father was Francis Eardley Carr-Gomm, brother of humanitarian Richard Carr-Gomm.\n\nHe met his first spiritual teacher, Ross Nichols, the founder of The Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids, when he was 11. He began studying with him when a teenager, and joined the Order when he was 18. He studied meditation with Olivia Robertson in Ireland, who later founded the Fellowship of Isis, and in his twenties he founded The Esoteric Society in London, which organised journeys for members to Bulgaria and Egypt, and hosted talks by well-known authors such as Gareth Knight, W. E. Butler, and Arthur Guirdham.\n\nSpirituality\nIn 1975 Nichols died, and Carr-Gomm followed a Bulgarian teacher, Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov for seven years, giving talks on his teachings and helping with the translation and publishing of his books into English. He also travelled to Bulgaria and studied the work of Aivanhov's teacher, Peter Deunov, visiting Sofia annually for fourteen years, teaching Deunov's Paneurhythmy dance in England and at Findhorn in Scotland. In his thirties he turned to a study of psychology, taking a BSc degree at University College London and Jungian analysis, with plans to become an analyst. On discovering Psychosynthesis, he trained instead as a therapist at the Institute of Psychosynthesis in London and began a private practice.\n\nIn 1988 he was asked to lead the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. He organised the Order's teachings into a distance-learning course, and edited Nichols' Book of Druidry with John Matthews. Since that time, the Order has grown to become the largest Druid teaching order in the world, with Professor of History Ronald Hutton writing that 'the OBOD correspondence course arguably represents one of the major documents of British spirituality from the late twentieth century'.\n\nIn 2021 the new \"Chosen Chief of OBOD\", Eimear Burke, was installed in the presence of Dave Smith aka Damh the Bard, the Order's Pendragon, and Stephanie Carr Gomm, the Order's scribe. Immediately preceding this Philip Carr Gomm gave a short farewell speech regarding his thirty two years in the role of Chosen Chief of OBOD. Carr Gomm made a broadcast at the beginning of the week in the Tea with a Druid Series, No. 128, addressing the current world situation and the need for peace in terms of the traditional druid's prayer and oath.\n\nDruidcraft\nDruidcraft is a spiritual practice embracing elements of both Druidry and Wicca, developed by Philip Carr-Gomm, and is also the title of a book he wrote about the same topic. That book deals with the combination of druidry and wicca in a new, combined practice. Within this book, Carr-Gomm claims that the differences between Wicca and Druidry do not stem from hundreds or thousands of years worth of tradition as these two distinct paths evolved separately. He claims that in fact the differences between modern Wicca and Druidism are due to the differences between two friends, Gerald Gardner and Ross Nichols who were deeply involved with these paths less than 75 years ago.\n\nBibliography\n Paneurythmy, Privately published. 1980.\n Special Times: Listening to Children, with Dr. Rachel Pinney and Meg Robinson, The Children's Hours Trust 1985.\n When the Flame and the Rose are One: Etchings by Liuben Dimanov with excerpts from letters by Rainer Maria Rilke edited and introduced by Philip Carr-Gomm.

{"id": "4105891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oltu", "title": "Oltu", "text": "Oltu (; ) is a municipality and district of Erzurum Province, Turkey. Its area is 1,441 km2, and its population is 30,075 (2022). The mayor is Necmettin Taşçı, from the AKP.\n\nHistory\nAn inscription found in Oltu's castle has been dated to the 7th century A.D.(see below), but the settlement is known to have been established much earlier. The city-fortress had once belonged to the Mamikonian nakharars and later passed into the hands of the Bagratunis. Administratively, it was found within the borders of the region of Vok'aghe in the province of Tayk. The first mention of Oltu as a fortified settlement is in the 9th century when the Georgian Bagratids occupied this region. After the death of the Iberian Kuropalates David in 1000, the troops of Emperor Basil II occupied the castles and towns in the region of Tao-Tayk‛, which included Oltu. In the following centuries, Oltu successively passed into the control of the Seljuk Turks, the Mongols and Turkmen tribes. The Ottomans conquered Olti from the Georgians in the sixteenth century.\n\nIn the summer of 1829, the Russian Empire took control of the region, but ultimately relinquished it to the Ottomans upon the conclusion of peace. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, Oltu () was incorporated into the Russian Empire and made the center of the Olti Okrug of the militarily administered Kars Oblast.\n\nThe Olti Okrug along with the entire Kars Oblast were ceded by the Russian SFSR to the Ottoman Empire by virtue of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918. After a brief reincorporation, Olti was again relinquished by the Ottomans in their 1919 withdrawal from the Kars Oblast as per the terms of the Armistice of Mudros. The First Republic of Armenia with British support expanded to include the self-governing Kars Oblast in the wake of the power vacuum caused by the Russian Revolution, however, was prevented from occupying the western half of the Olti Okrug by the commander of the Black Sea, G.F. Milne, as he believed Armenia had already acquired more territory than they could handle. In September 1920, 3 months after Armenia had seized the strategic coal fields of Penek in the Olti Okrug from the self-governing Kurdish militias, Turkish forces led by Kazım Karabekir recaptured the entire Olti Okrug, setting the stage for the Turkish–Armenian War—as a result of which, the Kars Oblast including Oltu was brought back under Turkish control in the midst of the Turkish War of National Liberation. The annexation was confirmed by the Treaty of Kars.\n\nThe primary historical sight in Oltu is the castle, which covers the top of a rocky outcrop. Its walls are fortified by large round towers and salients, including an imposing talus at the southwest. A circuit wall once extended from the outcrop to protect a small adjoining settlement. The medieval fortress is the result of two major periods of construction between the 7th and the 11th centuries; major repairs were undertaken by the Turkish Corps of Engineers in 1977. Atop the north tower are the remains of a Georgian hexaconch church in which a fragment of a 7th-century “bilingual” Greek-Armenian inscription was reused in the foundation. This Georgian church was built sometime between the 9th and 10th centuries. Inside the north tower is the tomb of a Muslim saint, Mişrî Zenūn. Late-antique and medieval churches as well as fortresses are located in the hills surrounding the Oltu-Penek valley at Cücürüs, Körolu, Olur, Kamhis, Sağoman, Olan, and nearby Kız.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period the Arslan Pasa Mosque was built in 1665 by Arslan Pasha together with his grave. It is a domed structure with a pencil minaret. Nearby is the 14th century Muslim tomb/kümbet, of Misri Zunnun located. During the Russian rule (1878-1914) a new church was built. Some of its stones could have come from the medieval Bana Cathedral. It was partly ruined until in January 2019, District Governor Senol Turan announced to restore its structure. The project is supposed to complete in 2021, and the church will be converted into a library. In the village of Gaziler there is a 12th-century Saltukid castle with a small Ottoman mosque built in 1784.\n\nDemography\nIn the late 19th century the district of Oltu was mainly Turkish (65% in 1897) while the small town of Oltu was mixed (predominantly Armenian). The district became part of the Russian Empire in 1878. The Russian authorities held a census in 1897 showing that the district of Oltu, including the town, had 31,519 inhabitants of whom 20,719 were Turks (65.7%), 3,505 Kurds (11.1%), 3,125 Armenians (9.9%), 2,704 Greeks (8.6%) and 1,038 Russians (3.3%). In 1897, the town of Oltu had a population of 2,373, which included an Armenian-speaking plurality, and significant Russian and Turkish-speaking minorities.

Operating from 1978 to 2016, it was replaced by the current Niagara Falls station. During its time, it was the western end of the Empire Corridor and served the Empire Service, Maple Leaf, and Niagara Rainbow lines.\n\nThe building was originally a freight warehouse for Lehigh Valley Railroad, built in 1959. The station opened for Amtrak on October 29, 1978, marking the return of the first passenger rail service to Niagara Falls since 1964. After its replacement as a station on December 6, 2016 it now serves as a train servicing and crew facility. It is located at Willard Avenue and 27th Street on the outskirts of town, about three miles from Niagara Falls and the city's downtown.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly stations\n\nRail service arrived in Niagara Falls around 1840, when the Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad completed the connection to Buffalo. As the town grew, prompted by the Erie Canal, the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge, and the Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company, rail service increased. Eventually, three different passenger stations were operating at the same time. New York Central Railroad, which took over the Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad, built a new station downtown at Falls Avenue and 2nd Street in 1851. The Erie Railroad built its own station a block away at Niagara Street and 2nd Street. In 1887, New York Central built a new Union Station at Depot and 10th Avenue near the Suspension Bridge and the U.S. Customhouse; this became the city's main station and at its peak served ten different railroads.\n\nNew York Central's original downtown station burned down in 1888, and was replaced with a new Italianate facility. Erie Railroad shuttered its downtown station in 1901; the structure was relocated to 4th Street and was eventually demolished in 1930. In 1961, New York Central shut down its downtown station. Both it and the Union Station were demolished in 1964, ending passenger rail service to Niagara Falls for 14 years.\n\nAmtrak comes to Niagara Falls\n\nAmtrak, in partnership with the State of New York, established the Willard Avenue station in 1978. For this purpose, they converted a former Lehigh Valley Railroad freight warehouse built in 1959 into a passenger station. The now former station is located on the edge of town, three miles from the falls and Downtown Niagara. Amtrak service began on October 29, 1978. More than 500 people attended the inaugural ceremonies, which included speeches by Congressman John LaFalce, New York Department of Transportation Commissioner William C. Hennessy, and Niagara Falls Mayor Michael O'Loughlin. As the ceremony concluded, the eastbound Niagara Rainbow rolled into the station.\n\nThe Willard Road station posed challenges over its time in operation, especially as the years went on. Though serviceable, the station was built as a freight depot. Passengers on the Niagara Rainbow and later the Maple Leaf needed to walk some distance to board or detrain, since trains could not pull up to the building. Also the station was far from the downtown Niagara Falls core, which officials believe depressed ridership. The building is also located on the edge of a busy CSX (formerly LVRR and later Conrail) freight rail yard. As the station was the first U.S. station serving the Maple Leaf coming in from Canada, it was an international point of entry into the United States. The openness of the area around the station, a lack of a way to properly secure the area and the fact it was a mile into the country made it a less than an ideal location for a U.S. point of entry and Customs inspection location especially in a post September 11, 2001 world. The station also did not have the high level platforms of more modern facilities.\n\nIn 1987, the city of Niagara Falls began the planning on a project to establish a new station at the U.S. Customhouse, near the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. State and local governments later got involved in the process of building the new multi-million dollar Niagara Falls Station and Customhouse Interpretive Center. U.S. Customs and Border Protection would share with Amtrak the complex consisting of the old customhouse and modern additions.\n\nThe project consisted of three phases, with a total estimated cost of $44 million.  Construction on the project began in August 2010, with funding only for the first two phases.\n\nIn October 2010, the U.S. Department of Transportation released $16.5 million in funds from the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program for work on the final phase of the International Station project. The new station was completed in July 2016 and opened on December 6, 2016. The Willard Avenue station closed following the departure of the trains that morning. The last train, an eastbound Empire Service train pulled away from the station at 6:50am.\n\nPost-Amtrak service\nToday the station is used as an Amtrak facility to service trains and change crews as well as a place to turn around Empire Service Amtrak train sets to go eastbound after they back out from stopping at the Niagara Falls Station and Customhouse Interpretive Center.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nNiagara Falls Amtrak Station (USA RailGuide – TrainWeb)\nNiagara Falls, N.Y.

The fifth named storm and third hurricane of the annual season, Ella developed from a tropical wave located just east of the Lesser Antilles on August 30. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella six hours later. The system crossed the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea late on August 30. Ella headed westward and by August 31, intensified into a Category 1 hurricane. Hours later, it strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The storm curved northwestward while south of Hispaniola and as a result, struck the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti on September 1. Flooding in that country killed 30 people in Aux Cayes and left 3 other missing. Additionally, thousands were left homeless, about one-third of crops were washed out, and numerous cattle were killed.\n\nAfter re-emerging into the Caribbean Sea, Ella made landfall on September 2,  near Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. Heavy rainfall lead to flooding, which in turn caused hundreds to flee their homes, and resulted in 5 fatalities. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas. The storm became disorganized while moving across the southern coast of Cuba and weakened to a tropical storm by later on September 2. Ella reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 4 and briefly re-strengthened. However, it began to weaken again while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm made landfall as a weak tropical storm near Corpus Christi, Texas on September 6. It rapidly weakened inland and dissipated later that day. Rainfall and rough surf caused both inland and coastal flooding in Texas. Offshore, the captain of a snapper boat fell overboard and went missing; he was later presumed to have drowned.\n\nMeteorological history\n\nA tropical wave was first observed near 50°W on August 29. Later that day, reconnaissance aircraft flight reported a wind shirt and above average shower and thunderstorm activity, but no low-level circulation. At 0600 UTC on August 30, a tropical depression developed just east of the Lesser Antilles. Six hours later, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella. The storm moved through the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea late on August 30. A reconnaissance aircraft into Ella reported sustained winds between 55 and 60 mph (95 km/h). It was around that time that the Weather Bureau Office in San Juan, Puerto Rico began issuing bulletins and advisories. Ella strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on August 31, six hours later, before becoming a Category 2 hurricane. On September 1, Ella curved west-northwestward, and by later that day, made landfall on the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). However, the storm was operationally thought to have remained offshore.\n\nElla re-emerged into the Caribbean Sea on September 1, and on September 2,  the storm made landfall near Santiago de Cuba, Cuba as a Category 1 Hurricane. Rough terrain over the island caused Ella to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane on September 2. Later that day, it further weakened to a tropical storm. The storm re-strengthened to a 70 mph (110 km/h) before reaching the Gulf of Mexico on September 4. Ella maintained this intensity for approximately 48 hours while moving west-northwestward, but began to weaken again on September 6. Hours later, the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi, Texas with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). It weakened back to a tropical depression and dissipated by late on September 6.\n\nPreparations and impact\n\nWind gusts in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were between . Heavy rainfall in the former caused local flooding. Damage was minor in both locations, confined mostly to crops. In preparation for Ella on the island of Hispaniola, a hurricane warning was issued from Barahona, Dominican Republic, and along the Haitian coastline to Saint-Marc. Ella brought heavy rains, peaking at  in Polo, Barahona. Damage from the resultant flooding in southwestern Dominican Republic reached $100,000. Additionally, wind gusts up to  were reported in Santo Domingo. Heavy precipitation in Haiti caused flash floods that killed 30 people near Aux Cayes, and three other people were listed as missing. As much as  of water covered roads in low-lying areas. A combination of strong winds and flooding also rendered thousands homeless. Damage to agriculture was heavy, with numerous cattle killed and about one-third of crops washed out, mostly to bananas and sugar cane. There was no monetary damage estimate, though losses in Haiti were noted to have been \"considerable\".\n\nFlooding also occurred in Cuba. Hundreds were evacuated their homes in four different provinces in Cuba, including 400 peasant families in Oriente Province. Near Santiago de Cuba, 25 houses were swept away after the Bayamo River overflowed. In the same area, a woman and her four sons drowned due to the swollen river. Additionally, a body of a man was recovered near Santa Cruz del Sur. Hundreds of livestock drowned, and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas. Losses in Cuba were estimated to have reached $100,000. Ella had a role in the Cuban Revolution as the government troops of Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar stayed in their barracks during the storm while the rebels made progress under cover of Ella. Later, when the guerrillas heard about Hurricane Fifi on the radio, Che Guevara taught his illiterate comrades that entities like tropical cyclones are named in alphabetical order.\n\nThe outer bands of Ella produced gale-force winds in the Florida Keys, causing damage mainly to antennas, fences, shrubbery, and signs. Winds on Stock Island damaged and overturned 4 trailers. Further north in Miami, a freighter was disabled and had to be towed in to port by the United States Coast Guard. Due to fears of a storm similar to Hurricane Audrey in the previous year, some residents evacuated southwestern Louisiana. An estimated 1,500 fled inland as Ella approached, leaving only 100 people to ride out the storm. In Louisiana, squalls from Ella caused the collision of two ocean-bound freighters along the Mississippi River near New Orleans. Impact elsewhere in Louisiana was limited to minor damage to rice crops in the southwestern portion of the state. On 35 oil platforms offshore of Houston, Texas, 1,400 people were alerted about possible evacuations if Ella were to approach the area. Along the coast, there were evacuations in Indianola, Port Alto, Port O'Connor, and Sabine Pass. Ella brought heavy rains to eastern and southern Texas, including  in Galveston. Precipitation brought minor flooding to low-lying areas of the Bolivar Peninsula, Galveston Island, Kemah, La Marque, the Matagorda Peninsula, Seabrook, and Texas City. Ella also brought swells to the coast of Texas. A portion of Texas State Highway 87 was closed due to inundation between Sabine Pass and High Island. Further south, tidal flooding along Texas State Highway 316 caused the closure of the portion near Indianola. Offshore, a  shrimp trawler sank during the storm, after being smashed against the rocks near Galveston. The crew fled to the life boats and were later rescued by a United States Coast Guard Patrol Vessel. The captain of the snapper boat E. W. Fowler went missing after he was washed overboard; the man was later presumed to have drowned.\n\nSee also\n\nTropical cyclone\nOther storms named Ella\n\nReferences\n\nElla (1958)\nElla\nElla (1958)\nElla (1958)\nElla (1958)\nElla (1958)\nElla (1958)"}

As Vaishnavites Pisharodys were traditionally caretakers of Hindu temples and considered as Gurus or Acharyas who taught Sanskrit and the Vedic texts. Most Pisharams (Pisharody ancestral households) are situated near Lord Krishna or Goddess Devi temples.They generally carry Vaishnavite surnames being a subset of Vishnavite sanyasi brahmin clan (Rama, krishna, Narayanan, Gopala etc) and a majority of the community still does teaching as their major profession. Eventhough they are seen more in Kerala their origin is from Kashmir and are spread throughout Indian major cities.\n\nOrigins\nThe Pisharodys belong to Koushika Gotra and deeply connected to the temples of Kerala and traditionally subscribed to the Vaishnavaite school of thought in the post Adi Shankaracharya period in Kerala.\n\nEtymology\nEtymologically, the word owes its origins to the saintly antecedents of the community. Bhikhshuvar (monk/mendicant) + Adikal (reverential addressing / honorific suffix) = Bhikhshuvaradikal, later corrupted to Pisharodikal and pisharody ( Shara itself being a term for a younger sanyasi). There is also another theory behind the origin of the name Pisharody. According to this, Pisharodys are descendants of a group of highly respected pure brahmans who intended to be Sanyasis. During the process of initiation to sanyasam, the aspirants are referred to as \"sharas\" in Sanskrit. However, the group could not complete the process to become full time \"sanyasis\". By then they had discarded almost all basic rituals usually performed by an ordinary brahman being elevated to the next level and hence they could not return to their earlier sect. Since they are already elevated to Sanyasi thought process, they continued as advisors to temples and authentic teachers of scriptures and higher level sanskrit. Thereafter this 'Shara' group and their descendants were called as Pisharody, later coloqualized into Pisharody, Pisharady and Sharoty. Pisharodys do not need to wear the sacred thread nor perform puja in temples as per the tradition, but act only as advisors. They do not cremate the dead body being a sanyasi, instead do the burial as samadhi, as the person has been charcterised with all sanyasi qualities. The last rites are oriented towards \"Vishnusayoojyam\" and the atma is directly submitted/given to lord vishnu. There for, there are no 'Bhrammarakshas' for this community and also do not perform the 'sradham' the usual annual death ritual, unlike other Hindus, the reason being their 'atma/jeeva' had already been merged with lord Vishnu after the death. The life of a 'shara' is considered as the last form of human birth and it is believed that, there will not be any rebirth.\n\nNotable people\nAttoor Krishna Pisharody\nAchyuta Pisharati\nCherukad Govinda Pisharody\nK.

He later served as aide-de-camp to Colonel Boyle, Commander of the West Counties Brigade Volunteer Infantry.\n\nSporting career\n\nCurling\nCurling made its first appearance at an Olympic Games at the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix, France. Four teams took part, one from Great Britain, one from France and two teams from Sweden. Astley appeared on the reserve team for the British. It was claimed that Astley had played at some point for the British team thus becoming eligible, and also playing for Sweden in a playoff match with the French team. This would have meant that Astley won both a gold and silver medal for different countries in the same sport - the only time this would have occurred. However, Astley actually made no appearances during the 1924 Winter Olympics for any teams and was not eligible for medals of any type.\n\nReferences\n\n1868 births\n1951 deaths\nPeople from Aylsham\n20th-century British Army personnel\n19th-century British Army personnel\nMilitary personnel from Norfolk\nWelch Regiment officers\nNorth Somerset Yeomanry officers\nCurlers at the 1924 Winter Olympics\nDeputy Lieutenants of Norfolk\nOlympic curlers for Great Britain\nSportspeople from Norfolk"}

Osmancık was one of the important destination points in the Ottoman period. Because of a number of earthquakes the city could not keep its ancient architecture. In the last century, there have been 4-5 heavy earthquakes. Being on the path of the Kızılırmak made the city an important settlement point since early history.

{"id": "4105966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmaneli", "title": "Osmaneli", "text": "Osmaneli is a town in Bilecik Province in the Marmara region of Turkey. It is the seat of Osmaneli District and has a population of 16,192 (2021). Its neighbours are Pamukova from north, Geyve from north-east, Gölpazarı from south-east, Bilecik from south, Yenişehir from south-west and İznik from west.\n\nSituated on a hillside at a point where the Karasu, flowing down from Kandilli Dağ, enters the Sakarya River, this small town was known in antiquity as Leukai and more recently as Lefke. South of the town is a narrow and very beautiful river gorge with rocky walls up to 100 m/328 ft high, contributing to some spectacular scenery.\n\nHistory\nLeukai was a town located on the road from Nicaea to Dorylaion and thus part of both the Byzantine Military Road and the Pilgrim's Road, the land route taken typically by Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. The town was then conquered from the Byzantine Empire by the Ottomans in 1313. Turks and Rums (Anatolian Greeks) lived here together until the War of Independence after which also the name of the town was changed from Lefke to Osmaneli.\n\nPlaces to see\n\nIn the west part of Osmaneli is the well-preserved ruins of a large Rum Orthodox church of the 1890s not far from it, a building that was used as a silk-spinning mill, and also the owner's house. There are several Ottoman-style homes available and watermelon festivals each year being celebrated, which is also worth seeing.\n\nThe only structure in Osmaneli left from such Rums, was a church, named Hagios Georgios (i.e. Saint George, turk. Aya Yorgi), located on Cumhuriyet Avenue. It is understood from the archived documents that this 19th-century structure had passed through several different construction cycles. It is written in detail in those documents that the first structure had a basilica type crushed wooden roof, and following the privileges granted to Greek people as a result of Royal Edict of Reform, the current plan was implemented. This plan, in the shape of a Greek cross, currently does not have the top cover. The most remarkable point of the structure is the towers on both sides of the entrance, on the western side. These towers, covered with small domes, are used not only for climbing to the second floor but also as bell tower. Such type of twin towers at western sides of the buildings is common until the first years following Christ. These towers, which can also be seen in early Byzantium era churches, have also been integral parts of Romanic, Gothic, and Baroque cathedrals in European architecture since the days of the Carolingian Empire. It is also possible to see in Greek churches of the 19th century located in Istanbul and Anatolia during the Ottoman Empire that such towers were being used for the same functions and in the same shapes as they were being used in Europe. The most beautiful representative of this trend is this Greek Church in Osmaneli.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOsmaneli municipality's official website \n\nPopulated places in Bilecik Province\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey\nOsmaneli District"}

Suenaga commissioned the Mōko Shūrai Ekotoba, an illustrated handscroll, in order to provide a pictorial account and chronicle his valor in battles against the Mongols, and to praise his commanders and the gods for his success during his campaigns.\n\nFighting the Mongols\n\nDuring the Mongol invasion of 1274, Suenaga fought at Hakata under Muto Kagesuke. Suenaga went to great lengths to achieve what he viewed as the honor of the warrior. Although under orders from Kagesuke to pull back at the beginning of the engagement, Suenaga disobeyed, saying “Waiting for the general will cause us to be late to battle. Of all the warriors of the clan, I, Suenaga will be the first to fight from Higo.”  He later encountered Kagesuke, whose retainer gave Suenaga a personal order to withdraw. So ordered to dismount from his horse, he refused, citing his desire to be the first into battle.\n\nPursuing recognition\n\nTo receive rewards for valor, others had to witness the deeds and report them directly to the shogunate. As record of his performance against the Mongols authored by the local commander was not sent to the shogunate, his deeds went unrecognized. Suenaga sold his horses and saddles to pay for a trip to Kamakura to report his deeds in battle to the shogunate. His petition was successful and he later commissioned illustrated scrolls of his military prowess and his administrative grievance and its resolution in his favor.\n\nBy his own account in the scrolls, Suenaga says, “Other than advancing and having my deeds known, I have nothing else to live for,” showing that, first, he wanted to advance in terms of measurable money and rank, and that, just as importantly, he sought fame and recognition.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nhttp://digital.princeton.edu/mongol-invasions/ Scrolls of the Mongol Invasions of Japan - Full digitized scans of the scrolls, multiple versions, including commentary, animated maps and translations.

{"id": "4105988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%20Fairchild", "title": "Steve Fairchild", "text": "Stephen Thomas Fairchild (born June 21, 1958) is an American football coach and former player who is the head coach of the Alphas of The Spring League. He served as head football coach at Colorado State University from 2008 to 2011, compiling a record of 16–33.\n\nEarly life\nFairchild was born in Decatur, Illinois. He graduated from Patrick Henry High School in San Diego, CA in 1976. Fairchild is a 1981 graduate of Colorado State, where he spent three seasons as a quarterback and earned All-WAC second-team honors behind BYU’s Jim McMahon. Fairchild also excelled in the classroom at Colorado State, earning first-team academic all-conference honors, the Merill Gheen Award for athletic and academic achievement and the NCAA District Athletic Achievement Award. He earned a bachelor of arts in economics from Colorado State and later a master of education from Azusa Pacific in 1983.\n\nPlaying career\nFairchild initially attended and played football for San Diego Mesa College, where he was named an All-American. In 1978, he transferred to Colorado State University, where he played quarterback until 1980. He split playing time with Keith Lee for his first two seasons, and was red-shirted in 1979. In his final year playing with the team, he was the full-time starter and scored 15 touchdowns while throwing for 2,573 yards. Fairchild graduated from Colorado State University in 1980 with a degree in economics.\n\nCoaching career\n\nCollege\nAfter graduating from CSU, Fairchild returned to San Diego Mesa Community College where he held the head coaching job for a number of years. From 1986 through 1993, Fairchild held assistant coaching jobs at University of New Mexico and at San Diego State University.  In 1993, he returned to Colorado State University, where he served as quarterbacks' coach until 1996, after which he was promoted to offensive coordinator.  During his time as an assistant coach at Colorado State, the team won a total of five conference titles.  In January 2013, Fairchild was hired by Mike London at the University of Virginia as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\n\nNFL\nIn 2001, Fairchild was hired by the Buffalo Bills to serve as running backs' coach. He left for the St. Louis Rams in 2003 where he served as an assistant offensive coordinator for three seasons, before returning to the Bills in 2006 for a season-and-a-half as the offensive coordinator. Fairchild returned to the NFL in 2012 and was with the San Diego Chargers as Senior Offensive Assistant/Special Assignments before moving to the University of Virginia in January 2013.\n\nThe Spring League\nHe was a coach in The Spring League in 2017.\n\nColorado State\nIn December 2007, Colorado State University announced that Fairchild would be returning to his alma mater to serve as head coach. Fairchild succeeded Sonny Lubick, under whom he had previously been an assistant.  During Fairchild's tenure as an assistant, CSU had been a mid-major power, but upon his arrival their fortunes had slipped, as the program went 17–31 in Lubick's final four years.\n\nCSU surprised in its first year under Fairchild. After a 38–17 loss to Colorado in his debut, Fairchild won his first game with CSU, a home victory over Sacramento State 23–20 thanks to a Ben DeLine field goal. The Rams followed that up with a 28–25 win over Houston one week later. However, CSU would lose 5 of their next 7 games, including tight home losses to conference powers TCU (13–7) and BYU (45–42). CSU rallied to win their final two games, with their 31–20 victory at Wyoming securing their sixth win and a berth in the New Mexico Bowl. Underdogs to Fresno State, CSU won a 40–35 thriller for their first bowl victory since the 2001 New Orleans Bowl. The star of the game (and most of the season) was senior RB Gartrell Johnson, who ran for a career-high 285 yard and added 90 receiving yards. His 375 total yards were the most for one player in bowl history. He ran for two touchdowns, the final being a game winning 77-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Johnson would be named first team all-MWC following the season. Fairchild became the first coach in CSU history to post a winning season in his first year with the program.\n\nDespite graduating Johnson and several other seniors, 2009 started much the way 2008 ended. The Rams opened the season September 6 at arch-rival Colorado. With a bevy of returning starters, and the game being played in Boulder for the final time (both schools had agreed to play the next decade's worth of games at Invesco Field at Mile High Stadium), the Buffs were heavy favorites. However, CSU led from start to finish, beating Colorado 23–17, marking their first victory at Folsom Field since 1986. Following home victories over Weber State and Nevada, the 3–0 Rams appeared headed to postseason yet again. However, the season would derail quickly. Following a 42–23 loss at ranked-BYU, the Rams dropped a 31–29 decision at Idaho followed by 24–17 home defeat to Utah. They were the first of four losses that would come by seven points or less. The Rams would not win another game for the rest of the season. A loss to previously winless New Mexico (29–27) assured CSU of a last place finish, and a 17–16 home defeat to Wyoming the day after thanksgiving not only cost the Rams the Bronze Boot (and their first home loss to Wyoming in 12 years), but made CSU just the 3rd team in Mountain West Conference history to go winless in conference play (Wyoming having done so in 2000 and 2001).\n\nIn 2010, The Rams finished with an identical 3–9 record with their lone wins home victories over lowly Idaho, New Mexico and UNLV. Blowouts were frequent and the most embarrassing came in the season's final two games. On senior day the Rams were shelled by Brigham Young 49–10. The following week they concluded their season with a 44–0 drubbing by rival Wyoming in the Border War. Wyoming hadn't won a single conference game until that dominating win over Colorado State.\n\nIt was hoped that Colorado State would begin to turn the corner in 2011, Fairchild's fourth year. Despite a 28–14 loss to rival Colorado, the Rams started 3–1 highlighted by a dramatic 35–34 comeback win in double overtime at Utah State on September 24. It would be CSU's final win. The following week CSU fell 38–31 to San Jose State on homecoming, the start of an 8-game losing streak. Fairchild was fired by new athletic director Jack Graham on December 4, 2011, one day after his Rams lost to the Wyoming Cowboys in the Border War. It was their third straight loss to Wyoming and the third straight time CSU finished their season 3–9.\n\nAlphas\nFairchild was named head coach of the Alphas of The Spring League on October 15, 2020.\n\nPersonal life\nFairchild is married to the former Nancy A. Kolstoe. They have two daughters, Lindsey and Jill.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nReferences\n\n1958 births\nLiving people\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nBuffalo Bills coaches\nColorado State Rams football coaches\nColorado State Rams football players\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nNew Mexico Lobos football coaches\nSan Diego State Aztecs football coaches\nSt. Louis Rams coaches\nJunior college football coaches in the United States\nSportspeople from Decatur, Illinois\nThe Spring League coaches"}

He currently serves as the senior vice president of officiating administration for the National Football League (NFL)'s officiating department. Previously, he served as the defensive backs coach or defensive coordinator for eight NFL teams between 1998 and 2019. He also served as the interim head coach for the Buffalo Bills in 2009 and for the Carolina Panthers in 2019.  Fewell won Super Bowl XLVI as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, a position he held for five seasons.\n\nEarly years\nFewell attended South Point High School in Belmont, North Carolina. In 1979, he helped lead the school to a 3-A state football championship.\n\nCollege\nFewell attended Lenoir-Rhyne College and was a football standout. In football, he was a four-year letterman and as a senior, he was named the team's Most Improved Player.\n\nCoaching career\n\nCollege\nFewell was a college coach for 13 years (1985-1997), working as an assistant at North Carolina, Army, Kent State, and Vanderbilt.\n\nJacksonville Jaguars\nFewell entered the NFL as the defensive backs coach for Tom Coughlin in 1998 and stayed there through 2002.  Jacksonville's pass defense ranked third in the NFL in 1999 and two years later the Jaguars gave up only 13 touchdown passes.\n\nSt. Louis Rams\nIn 2003, Fewell moved to St. Louis, where he was the secondary coach of the Rams.\n\nChicago Bears\nFewell was a defensive backs coach with Chicago from 2004 to 2005 under head coach Lovie Smith.\n\nBuffalo Bills\nFewell was hired as defensive coordinator of the Buffalo Bills in 2006.  In what was statistically their best season under Fewell, the 2008 Bills defense ranked 2nd in the AFC in negative yardage plays, recorded 7 games of holding opposing offenses to less than 100 yards rushing, finished 4th in the NFL in red zone defense (41.8%), and allowed just 14 passing touchdowns all year.\n\nIn Week 10 of the 2009 season, the Bills fired head coach Dick Jauron after a 3–6 start and Fewell was appointed interim head coach. He led Buffalo to a 3–4 finish. Following the season finale, the Bills fired their entire coaching staff, including Fewell.\n\nNew York Giants\nOn January 14, 2010, Fewell was hired as defensive coordinator of the New York Giants.  Fewell served under head coach Tom Coughlin, under whom Fewell previously worked during his time with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  On February 5, 2012, the Giants defeated the New England Patriots 21–17 to win Super Bowl XLVI. Under his leadership, the Giants defense was often criticized for being \"off and soft\", allowing other teams to come back into games they should not have been able to. On January 7, 2015, the Giants and Fewell parted ways after he spent five years in charge of the defense.\n\nWashington Redskins\nFewell served as defensive backs coach for the Washington Redskins for two seasons.\n\nReturn to the Jacksonville Jaguars \nAfter Tom Coughlin returned to the Jacksonville Jaguars as the executive vice president of football operations, Fewell was brought in to act as the defensive backs coach on Doug Marrone's staff.\n\nCarolina Panthers\nFewell was named the secondary coach of the Carolina Panthers on January 15, 2019. He was named interim head coach on December 3, 2019, following the dismissal of Ron Rivera.\n\nNFL Officiating\nIn 2020, Fewell joined the NFL's officiating department as senior vice president of officiating administration.\n\nHead coaching record\n\n* – Interim head coach\n\nReferences\n\n1962 births\nLiving people\nNew York Giants coaches\nBuffalo Bills coaches\nBuffalo Bills head coaches\nChicago Bears coaches\nJacksonville Jaguars coaches\nWashington Redskins coaches\nSt. Louis Rams coaches\nCarolina Panthers coaches\nNational Football League defensive coordinators\nArmy Black Knights football coaches\nKent State Golden Flashes football coaches\nLenoir–Rhyne Bears football players\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels football coaches\nVanderbilt Commodores football coaches\nPeople from Belmont, North Carolina\nAfrican-American coaches of American football\nPlayers of American football from Gaston County, North Carolina\nLenoir–Rhyne University alumni\nNational Football League executives\nCarolina Panthers head coaches"}

Its area is 458 km2, and its population is 13,740 (2022). It is located in the historical region of Tur Abdin.\n\nIn the town, there was a church of Saint George (). The church of Saint George was later converted into a mosque.\n\nEtymology\nThe Syriac name of the town is derived from \"ma'ṣartā\" (\"wine-press\" in Syriac).\n\nHistory\nMaʿsarteh is identified as the town of Madaranzu in Bit-Zamani, which was conquered by Ashurnasirpal II, King of Assyria, in 879 BC. It is later mentioned by Theophylact Simocatta and George of Cyprus as Matzaron (, ). The town was likely captured by a Sasanian army in 573 at the time of the siege of Dara, during the Roman-Sasanian War of 572-591, but was retaken and the fort was restored by the Roman commanders Theodore and Andrew in 587.\n\nMaʿsarteh was part of the Syriac Orthodox diocese of the Monastery of Saint Abai () until the death of its last bishop Isḥoq Ṣaliba in 1730, upon which the diocese was subsumed into the diocese of Mardin. German orientalist Eduard Sachau visited the town in 1880. Until the Assyrian genocide, the town was exclusively populated by Assyrians of the Syriac Orthodox Church. Survivors of the genocide fled to the Monastery of Saint Ananias.\n\nAfter the Assyrian genocide, Assyrians from Maʿsarteh emigrated to Bethlehem and Jerusalem. In 1960, Maʿsarteh was officially renamed Ömerli, from the name of the Mhallami tribe Ömeryan. By 1989, all Assyrian families had fled the town, however, some later returned and, as of 2013, three Assyrian families inhabit the town.\n\nPresently, the town mostly consist of Kurds and Mhallami. Of the two groups, the first ones to settle in the town were the Mhallamis who came from villages between Ömerli and Midyat such as Şenköy and Çavuşlu, while Kurds from the Bilikan tribe supposedly settled in the town due to blood feud. The Bilikan Kurds would become Arabophone over time and came to dominate local politics because of the size of their large families. They are plausibly the largest group in the town.\n\nOther groups in the town include Kurds from other tribes, Arabs, few Assyrians and Georgians, and civil servants of Turkish roots.\n\nAccording to the leaders of the Kurdish Omerkan (or Omeryan) tribe, who lives in the vicinity of the town, Ömerli had been under their rule for many years and considered the town to be in their territory. However, the town is not affiliated with any Kurdish tribe.\n\nPolitics \nIn 1925, the town became the seat of a bucak (subdistrict) of Savur, and was elevated to district in 1953. In January 2017 the towns mayor Süleyman Tekin was arrested. In the local elections of 2019, Hüsamettin Altındağ from the Justice and Development Party was elected mayor.\n\nComposition\nThere are 46 neighbourhoods in Ömerli District.

His father was a French army officer.  Charles worked for the telegraph company as a civil engineer and mechanic.  He made improvements to the telegraph system of L. F. Breguet (a French instrument maker) and Samuel F. B. Morse.  Charles Bourseul experimented with the electrical transmission of the human voice and developed an electromagnetic microphone, but his telephone receiver was unable to convert electric current back into clear human voice sounds.\n\nIn 1854 Bourseul wrote a memorandum on the transmission of the human voice by electric currents that was first published in a magazine L'Illustration (Paris), though no prototype was built. That is about the same time that Meucci later claimed to have created his first attempt at the telephone in Italy. \n\nBourseul explained: “Suppose a man talks near a moving disc that is flexible enough not to lose any of the vibrations of the voice, and that this disc periodically interrupts the current of a battery; then, at a certain distance, we could have another disc that simultaneously executes the same vibrations. The passage of an electric current through a metal wire transforms into a magnet a piece of soft iron placed in the vicinity of the wire. As soon as the current stops, the soft iron is demagnetized. This magnet, the electromagnet, can thus alternatively attract or repel a metal plate. It would be perfectly possible to arrange this second metal plate, so as to make it repeat the same vibrations as the first; this result would be exactly the same as if the person had spoken in the immediate vicinity against this second plate. In other words, the ear would be affected, as if the sounds had reached it directly through the first metal disc. [...] It is certain that, in a more or less distant future, speech will be transmitted by electricity. I have made  experiments in this direction; they are delicate and demand time and patience, but the approximations obtained promise a favourable result.”\n\nBourseul died in Saint-Céré, France, at the age of 83.\n\nSee also \n\n Johann Philipp Reis\n Alexander Graham Bell\n Antonio Meucci\n Invention of the telephone\n\nReferences\n History of Telecommunications 1874-1930\n (fr) Charles Bourseul, « Transmission électrique de la parole », L'Illustration, 26.08.1854.\n (fr) G.

It is situated in Sneek, the Netherlands.\n\nIn the 15th and 16th century, a defensive wall had been built around Sneek. The city lay on the important trade route between Leeuwarden and Stavoren, from which the rich western parts of the Netherlands (now North Holland and South Holland) could be reached. To facilitate this trade, a new harbour called the \"Kolk\" was built to the southwest of the city and in 1613 the Waterpoort was erected to connect city and harbour. It formed part of the city walls, but when large parts of these were demolished in the early 18th century, it was decided to leave the Waterpoort intact.\n\nThe style of the gate, now the symbol of Sneek, can be described as Manierist. It is unclear who designed it, but names suggested include those of Thomas Berentsz. and Jacob Lous. Above the gate itself, which originally would have had wooden fences, is a loggia (gallery) and above that are what were the quarters of the gatekeeper. On each side is an octagonal tower.\nIt is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 34075.\n\nSee also\nBrama Młyńska (Mill Gate), another surviving medieval watergate.\n\nReferences\n\n  Stenvert, R. et al.

{"id": "4106074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Phenix%20City%20Story", "title": "The Phenix City Story", "text": "The Phenix City Story is a 1955 American film noir crime film directed by Phil Karlson for Allied Artists, written by Daniel Mainwaring and Crane Wilbur and starring John McIntire, Richard Kiley, and Kathryn Grant. It had an unusual \"triple premiere\" held on July 19, 1955 in Phenix City, Alabama, Columbus, Georgia, and Chicago, Illinois (the AFI incorrectly lists the date as July 9).\n\nPlot\nIn a corrupt Alabama town near the Army's Fort Benning, the law can do little to stop the criminal activities of Rhett Tanner, particularly in the wide-open \"red-light district\" area known for prostitution, taverns, and crooked gambling. Most of the police do not even try, since they are on Tanner's payroll.\n\nLocal attorney Albert \"Pat\" Patterson, initially neutral and complacent, is urged to run for State Attorney General and clean up Phenix City, but he wants no part of a thankless, impossible job. He is content to welcome home his son John from military service. However, soon violence breaks out trying to silence the reform-minded citizens committee. John gets caught in the middle when Clem Wilson, a thug who works for Tanner, and others assault innocent citizens.\n\nPatterson finally agrees to get involved in reforming the town, but as soon as he wins the Democratic nomination for state attorney general, he is killed. It is up to John to avenge his father, but his own family ends up at risk.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\n\nThe film depicts the real-life 1954 assassination of Albert Patterson, who had just been nominated as the Democratic candidate for Alabama Attorney General on a platform of cleaning up Phenix City, a city controlled by organized crime. Patterson was murdered in Phenix City, and the subsequent outcry resulted in the imposition of martial law by the state government. Some prints of the film include a 13-minute newsreel-style preface including newsman Clete Roberts interviewing many of the actual participants.\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\nWhen the film was released in 1955, Bosley Crowther, film critic for The New York Times, gave it a positive review, writing, \"In a style of dramatic documentation that is as sharp and sure as was that of On the Waterfront--or, for a more appropriate comparison, that of the memorable All the King's Men--scriptwriters Crane Wilbur and Dan Mainwaring and director Phil Karlson expose the raw tissue of corruption and terrorism in an American city that is steeped in vice. They catch in slashing, searching glimpses the shrewd chicanery of evil men, the callousness and baseness of their puppets and the dread and silence of local citizens. And, through a series of excellent performances, topped by that of John McIntyre as the eventually martyred crusader, they show the sinew and the bone of those who strive for decent things.\"\n\nFilm critic Bruce Eder wrote, \"One of the most violent and realistic crime films of the 1950s, The Phenix City Story pulses with the bracing energy of actual life captured on the screen in its establishing shots and key scenes, and punctuates that background with explosively filmed action scenes. Director Phil Karlson showed just how good he was at merging well-told screen drama with vivid verisimilitude and leaving no seams to show where they joined. Filmed on location in Alabama with a documentary-like look, the movie captured the ambiance and tenor of its Deep South setting better than almost any other fact-based movie of its era.\"\n\nAccuracy\nRay Jenkins, one of the two reporters who covered the Phenix City story for the Columbus Ledger, whose coverage won the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for Meritorious Public Service, has contended that the film departed significantly from reality. Jenkins writes, \"For starters, the film was a rush job intended to capture public interest while the story was still unfolding. As a result, the film leaves the impression that the local mafia that ran the vice industry in Phenix City killed Albert Patterson. Subsequent indictments and trials demonstrated beyond doubt that the assassination was politically motivated. Also, the film depicts an inflammatory scene in which the mob kills a young black girl and tosses the body onto the lawn of the Patterson home as a warning. Nothing remotely like this episode actually happened.\"\n\nLegacy\nIn 2019, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nIn other media \nIt was also featured in the 1995 documentary film A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies.\n\nDVD release\nWarner Bros. released the film on DVD on July 13, 2010, in its Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 5.\n\nSee also\n List of American films of 1955\n Culture of Alabama\n Culture of Georgia\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n  (John Patterson's speech)\n Scorsese Curates: The Phenix City Story on The Daily Beast\n\n1955 films\n1950s crime thriller films\nAmerican black-and-white films\nAmerican crime thriller films\nCrime films based on actual events\n1950s English-language films\nFilm noir\nFilms about elections\nFilms directed by Phil Karlson\nFilms produced by Samuel Bischoff\nFilms scored by Harry Sukman\nFilms set in Alabama\nFilms set in 1954\nRussell County, Alabama\nUnited States National Film Registry films\n1950s American films\nFilms set in the 1950s\nFilms about racism"}

{"id": "4106078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce%20Address%20Tag%20Validation", "title": "Bounce Address Tag Validation", "text": "In computing, Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) is a method, defined in an Internet Draft, for determining whether the bounce address specified in an E-mail message is valid.  It is designed to reject backscatter, that is, bounce messages to forged return addresses.\n\nOverview\nThe basic idea is to send all e-mail with a return address that includes a timestamp and a cryptographic token that cannot be forged.   Any e-mail that is returned as a bounce without a valid signature can then be rejected.  E-mail that is being bounced back should have an empty (null) return address so that bounces are never created for a bounce and therefore preventing messages from bouncing back and forth forever.\n\nBATV replaces an envelope sender like mailbox@example.com with prvs=tag-value=mailbox@example.com, where prvs, called \"Simple Private Signature\", is just one of the possible tagging schemes; actually, the only one fully specified in the draft. The BATV draft gives a framework that other possible techniques can fit into. Other types of implementations, such as using public key signatures that can be verified by third parties, are mentioned but left undefined.  The overall framework is vague/flexible enough that similar systems such as Sender Rewriting Scheme can fit into this framework.\n\nHistory\nSami Farin proposed an Anti-Bogus Bounce System in 2003 in news.admin.net-abuse.email, which used the same basic idea of putting a hard to forge hash in a message's bounce address. \nIn late 2004, Goodman et al. proposed a much more complex \"Signed Envelope Sender\" that included a hash of the message body and was intended to address a wide variety of forgery threats, including bounces from forged mail.  Several months later, Levine and Crocker proposed BATV under its current name and close to its current form.\n\nProblems\nThe draft anticipates some problems running BATV.\n Some mailing lists managers (e.g. ezmlm) still key on the bounce address, and will not recognize it after BATV mangling.\n Greylisting requires BATV implementations to keep the same tag across retransmissions for a reasonable time.  This may also cause each e-mail to be delayed unless the greylisting system ignores the tag, or whitelists sending hosts that successfully retry.\n Challenge-response spam filtering and systems that sort mail based on the bounce address (e.g. for removing duplicates) may work less smoothly with BATV-tagged addresses.\n\nThere are also problems that prevent BATV systems from eliminating all backscatter.\n Some legitimate e-mail gets sent with empty return address that is not a bounce and therefore will not have the special tokens.  For example, the Delivery Status Notification extension defined in  requires a null return path when sending email with a \"NOTIFY=NEVER\" option to a non-conforming server.\n Some e-mail bounces (incorrectly) get sent not to the return address, but to the e-mail address on the From: header.\n Some mail systems that implement Callback verification use \"postmaster\" instead of the null return address.\n\nSee also\n Sender Policy Framework (SPF)\n Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS)\n Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)\n Variable envelope return path (VERP)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n BATV draft\n BATV web page\n Greylisting and BATV  Implementation of BATV (with a BATV tester) for qmail / netqmail\n\nEmail authentication"}

It is the seat of Pazaryeri District. Its population is 6,243 (2021). The district has several small lakes, as well as a number of buildings in traditional Ottoman style. The mayor is Zekiye Tekin. Pazaryeri is one of the most important hop producers in Turkey. The town has famous local dishes like helva and boza.\n\nHistory \nSeveral ancient Greek votives and inscriptions dedicated to Zeus Bronton and Apollon Phoibos have been found near the town, where he was heavily worshipped and a cult of them was present. A common cult of two gods was rare in the ancient world. There were several temples dedicated to them. Heracles was also worshipped there. Names of the priests in the temples include: Trophimas, Aleksandros, Asklepiodotos, Askles, Marcus, Sextus and Sosigenos. The cult and the temples remained active until, at least, the 2nd century AD. A Greek metrical epitaph and a bust of a deceased 12-year-old boy called Roufeinos was also discovered in the city. An inscription dedicated to Demeter, one of only two surviving in the administrative district of Iznik (ancient Nicaea), was also found near the city. In Hellenistic times, the city was located in the border of the Kingdom of Bithynia, separating it from Phrygia. \n\nIn Byzantine times, the city was known as Armenokastron (; ). Although the name implies it, there is no record of Armenians living in the city. Armenokastron was one of the most important cities of the Bithynia theme. In the first half of the 12th century, it was captured by the Seljuks, but it was recaptured by the Byzantines during the Second Crusade, subsequently marking the limit of Byzantine hegemony in the East. The modern town was built on this Byzantine settlement, or somewhere near. In Ottoman times, a military road between the city of Iznik and Pazaryeri was built, probably in the beginning of the 16th century. This road probably ran via Köprühisar and Yarhisar towards Pazaryeri.\n\nDuring the Turkish War of Independence Pazaryeri was completely destroyed by burning by the Greek Army during its advance inland in July 1921. However it suffered atrocities months before its complete destruction. A report of the Western Front Command of the Turkish Army dating 16 February 1921 stated that 24 people were murdered inside the town centre while 16 sheep and 10 goats were also among the casualties. On the 15th of April the 1st Infantry Division Command of the Turkish Army reported that 102 inhabitants were taken prisoners while 4 killed, 6 wounded and a woman raped by the Greek Army. During the burning, Turkish elderly inhabitants who could not flee the town were killed. Second-Lieutenant Pantelis Priniotakis describes the events on his diary dating to 13th of July 1921 with the following words:\n\nThe official result was that 644 buildings, the entire town was destroyed by the Greek Army.\n\nReferences\n\nPopulated places in Bilecik Province\nPazaryeri District\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey"}

{"id": "4106092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford%20Training%20Area", "title": "Stanford Training Area", "text": "Stanford Training Area (STANTA), originally known as Stanford Battle Area, is a British Army training area situated in the English county of Norfolk. The area is approximately  in size; it is some  north of the town of Thetford and  south-west of the city of Norwich. The site is run by the Mission Ready Training Centre (MRTC).\n\nHistory\nThe area was originally established in 1942 when a battle training area was required and a 'Nazi village' established. Military exercises were already known in the area; tanks had deployed to Thetford in the First World War. The complete takeover involved the evacuation of the villages of Buckenham Tofts, Langford, Stanford, Sturston, Tottington and West Tofts.\n\nThe area was used during the run-up to the D-Day invasion and since then has hosted many exercises.  In 2009 a  village designed to replicate its Afghan equivalent was added to the Battle Area for the training of troops deployed in support of the War in Afghanistan. The site, built at a cost of £14 million, is state of the art and populated by Afghan nationals, ex-Gurkha soldiers and amputee actors, who simulate the Afghan National Army, locals and wounded soldiers. The village includes houses, a market and a mosque. It also features a system that pumps out smells like rotten meat and sewage.\n\nThe facilities\nThe battle area includes four historic churches; the one at West Tofts was restored by Pugin and a new church building forms part of the purpose-built village of Eastmere. Eastmere was originally built to give soldiers experience of fighting on the northern European plains.  There is a short landing strip at \n\nAs a live firing area, access is not allowed without special permission from the Army. In the main this is limited to a number of tours a year and compassionate grounds for former residents of the villages or their relatives.\n\nThe area forms part of the distinctive Breckland landscape region, a gorse-covered sandy heath which offers poor agricultural opportunities. Arguably, its use as a military training area has safeguarded a substantial archaeological landscape. Like many other military or restricted access areas in the UK such as Bovington Camp, the buffer area around Porton Down, and MOD areas on Salisbury Plain, it is the home of a wealth of rare species of flora and fauna already lost in other parts of the country. Parts of the training area are designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).\n\nThe battle area was used in the filming of many of the episodes of the comedy series Dad's Army.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n  Ordnance Survey (1999).

Its namesake natural bridge is the centerpiece of the park.  The natural sandstone arch spans  and is  high. The natural process of weathering formed the arch over millions of years.  The park is approximately  of which approximately  is dedicated by the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves as a nature preserve. In 1981 this land was dedicated into the nature preserves system to protect the ecological communities and rare species habitat.  The first federally endangered Virginia big eared bats, Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus, recorded in Kentucky were found at Natural Bridge State Resort Park in the 1950s.\n\nHistory and trails\nThe park was founded as a private tourist attraction in 1895 by the Lexington and Eastern Railroad.  In 1910, Louisville and Nashville Railroad acquired the land when it purchased the Lexington and Eastern Railroad. In 1926, L&N's President Wible L. Mapother turned over its approximately 137 acres to the Kentucky State Park Commission, making the Park one of Kentucky's original four state parks when that system was established the same year. There are over  of trails over uneven terrain from moderate to strenuous difficulty, including trails to White's Branch Arch, Henson's Cave Arch, and other scenic areas. Some of the most famous sites are the arch itself, \"Lovers Leap\", and \"Fat Man's Squeeze\". The park's  \"Original Trail\" to the natural bridge dates from the 1890s. Other trails include the  Sand Gap Trail and the  Balanced Rock Trail. Five miles (8 km) of the  Sheltowee Trace National Recreation Trail run through the park, including the Whittleton Trail which connects the park to the Red River Gorge Geologic Area. Activities such as hiking off-trails, disturbing wildlife, or collecting plants are not legal in any Kentucky State Park, and pets are not allowed on most trails at Natural Bridge State Park. \"Fat Man's Squeeze\", a narrow passage in the rock formation, leads to the bottom of the arch. In addition to these trails, a paid ski lift attraction is available to take people to the top of the Natural Bridge.\n\nNatural Bridge has several unique sandstone rock formations, including the Balanced Rock. This is a huge block of sandstone balanced on the edge of a cliff near the Natural Bridge. The \"Balanced Rock\", is located on Trail #2, not far above Hemlock Lodge.  In the early days of the Park, it was called the Sphinx because, when viewed from the correct angle, it crudely resembles the Sphinx in Egypt.  Although it is now called the Balanced Rock, it is in fact a pedestal rock - a single piece of stone that has weathered in such a fashion that its midsection is narrower than its cap or its base.  This formation is one of the biggest and most perfectly formed examples of a pedestal rock east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAnnual events\n\nNatural Bridge State Park is a member of the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics, and offers guided backpacking trips and natural history educational programs.  Annual events open to the public include Herpetology Weekend each May, Natural Arches Weekend each February, and the Kentucky Native Plant Society's Wildflower Weekend each April.\n\nThe Kentucky Natives Society's Wildflower Weekend in April consists of Kentucky plants and how they are essential to the well-being of our natural ecosystems commonwealth. \" We incorporate research and support efforts to identify and protect endangered, threatened, and rare native plant species,\" says KNPS.ORG.\n\nThe State Park is also famous for hosting traditional Appalachian square dances. The traditional Appalachian style dances are held on Friday and Saturday evenings throughout the warm starlit Ky summers on the open-air dance floor.  The dance draws hundreds of participants and spectators, showcasing dance groups and singer/performer talents from all over.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n\n Slade, Kentucky—unincorporated community within the boundaries of the park\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOffice of Kentucky Nature Preserves\nNatural Bridge State Resort Park at Kentucky State Parks\nNatural Bridge State Resort Park at American Byways\nLeave No Trace\n\nState parks of Kentucky\nNatural arches of Kentucky\nProtected areas of Powell County, Kentucky\nProtected areas established in 1926\nProtected areas of Wolfe County, Kentucky\nDaniel Boone National Forest\nNature centers in Kentucky\nLandforms of Wolfe County, Kentucky\nLandforms of Powell County, Kentucky\n1926 establishments in Kentucky"}

It had a population of 6,365 in 2021 and is populated by Kurds and Turks. The mayor is Ruhan Alan from the Republican People's Party (CHP).\n\nThe neighborhoods of the town are Camiikebir, Derebaşı, İstiklal, Kaledibi, Soğukpınar.\n\nHistory \nThe area of Pertek was ruled by different empires in its history. In the medieval period such as the Armenians and Byzantines before being taken over by different Islamic dynasties after the 11th century. Later it became part of the Ilkhanids and others and finally became part of the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century.\n\nDuring the Ottoman period Pertek was a hereditary Kurdish sanjak. The old town of Pertek (Eski Pertek) was located near the citadel but was abandoned in 1838 and moved to its current location. Armenian sources state that about 180 Armenians still lived in the old town (Eski Pertek) up until the early 1900s despite the rising water levels of the Euphrates river. After 1889, it was fully incorporated into the Mamuretul-aziz Vilayet as a nahiye district of the Charsanjak kaza within the sanjak of Dersim.\n\nAccording to the 1881 Ottoman census, there were 6 neighborhoods of Pertag town - 1154 total males (966 Muslim, 188 Armenian Apostolic) in 520 households. The general district had 23 villages of Pertag district - 127 total males (943 Muslim, 184 Armenian Apostolic) in 552 households. Females were often undercounted or entirely disregarded from census counts.\n\nAs a result of the construction of the Keban Dam, the Pertek district experienced the submerging of a number of its district's villages. Some of the settlements submerged were Eski Pertek, Borkin, Korluca (Til), Balan, Deşt, Zahuran, Beroç, Karameşe (Tezikan) [partially submerged], Tuzbaşı (Nisirto) [abandoned].\n\nHistoric monuments \nThere are two historic Ottoman mosques in Pertek. The Baysungur mosque (16th century) and Celebi Ali mosque (16th century). The mosques were later dismantled and moved from the site of the old town to protect them from the rising water shore of the Lake Keban. The Pertek Castle is located on an Island. There are other historic sights in the nearby area. The village of Sağman has a ruined citadel with a 16th-century mosque, tomb and tekke built by the Kurdish sanjak bey Keykusrav.\n\nArchaeology \nIn August 2022, archaeologists led by Kenan Öncel announced that they had discovered a child skeleton in an oval-shaped pit in Tozkoparan Mound. They also revealed terracotta potteries, obsidians, bones, stone tools and arrowheads. In order to determine the skeleton's diet and age-at-death, researchers are planning to trace the diseases left in the bones.\n\nReferences\n\nPopulated places in Tunceli Province\nPertek District\nTurkish Kurdistan\nKurdish settlements in Tunceli Province\nDistrict municipalities in Turkey"}

According to its governing body, the Colorado Chautauqua Association, it is also unique in that it is the only year-round Chautauqua.\n\nThe Colorado Chautauqua in the 21st century \n\nThe Colorado Chautauqua Association, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization formerly known as the Texas-Colorado Chautauqua Association, presents a variety of lectures, live musical performances, and silent films on a year-round schedule, although the summer months are emphasized. The operation also includes the Chautauqua Dining Hall. Short-term lodging is also offered. The Association manages  leased from the City of Boulder, including the historic Chautauqua buildings, all of which are still in regular use:\n the 1898 Chautauqua Auditorium (listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 21, 1978)\n the 1898 Dining Hall\n the 1900 Academic Hall (now the Administration Building)\n the 1911 Missions House\n the 1918 Community House\n the 1919 Columbine Lodge\n 98 cottages, constructed between 1899 and 1954 (80 before 1915), some of which are owner-occupied and some of which are rentals offered by the Colorado Chautauqua Association.\n\nBetween these  of Association land and Baseline Road lies a  Boulder city park called Chautauqua Park. This area is marked \"Chautauqua Green\" on the map published by the Colorado Chautauqua Association. Both the park and the Association land are open to the public without an entry fee.\n\nThe entire  site, including both the Association land and the adjacent Chautauqua Park, was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 10, 2006. The site is bounded on the north by Baseline Road, on the northeast by residential back yards on 10th Street, and on the southeast, south, and west by the City of Boulder Mountain Parks.\n\nResidents of Boulder generally refer to the entire  site by the single word Chautauqua. In the early years, the site was known as \"Texado Park\".\n\nHistory\n\n19th century\n\n1897 \nThe Texas-Colorado Chautauqua Association was incorporated in Austin, Texas in September 1897. This organization was for the purpose of conducting a summer school and lecture series for Texas school teachers at a Colorado location to be determined later. A cooler summer climate than Texas was desired.\n\n1898 \nIn February 1898, the Texas-Colorado Chautauqua Association and the City of Boulder entered into an agreement to locate the Chautauqua near Boulder, subject to the city providing sufficient area and suitable facilities. A city bond election was held on April 5, 1898 and the necessary bonds and expenditures were approved to purchase the land and build the first buildings.\n\nOn April 18, 1898 the Boulder City Council appointed a \"Committee on Parks,\" the earliest beginning of the city's Parks Department. Later in April, the Bachelder Ranch site was selected and purchased for the Chautauqua; the grounds, one mile (1.6 km) south of the city, were named Texado Park. On May 12, 1898 construction of the Chautauqua Auditorium commenced; the Dining Hall construction started one week later. Both buildings were completed in time for the opening of the first Chautauqua season on July 4, 1898.\n\nHowever, the two greatest disappointments of the initial season were first, that no residential cottages had yet been constructed; and second, that the electric streetcar line from downtown Boulder to Texado Park had not been built in time for the opening. In the first season, Colorado Chautauqua attenders were housed entirely in tents. They traveled the 1.5 miles (about 2 km) from the Boulder railway station to the Chautauqua on foot or in horsedrawn vehicles, via dirt roads that were alternately dusty and muddy.\n\nThe 1898 fee was $75 for the entire six-week season, including tuition, admission to all lectures and entertainments, all boarding and lodging, and round-trip rail fare to Boulder from any location within a  radius of Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nThe first year's six-week program featured no fewer than 94 scheduled speeches, including addresses from the well-known evangelist T. Dewitt Talmadge, the Kentucky orator Henry Watterson, the governors of Colorado and Texas, the mayor of Boulder, and the president of the University of Colorado. Various clergymen also delivered sermons each Sunday.\n\nThe Kansas City Symphony Orchestra was in residence for the entire season, and would return many times in future years. They played a sacred concert each Sunday, and incidental music as requested, often several times a day. Various bands, pianists, and vocalists also performed.\n\nMusic classes were offered including cello, guitar, mandolin, piano, singing and chorus. The Collegiate Department of the Chautauqua offered 51 different classes in mathematics, chemistry, botany, physics, psychology, education, as well as English, Latin, Greek, French, and German language and literature.\n\nFrom that first season, the Colorado Chautauqua also presented motion pictures in the Auditorium. The evening program for July 21, 1898, was \"Edison's Genuine Projectoscope, Colorscopic Diorama and Wargraph, with Music, reproducing scenes of the war with Spain.\"\n\nOther activities included burro and horseback rides, hikes to the nearby Flatirons on Green Mountain, stagecoach rides to Boulder Falls and Eldorado Springs, and mountain railway excursions to destinations as far away as Ward.\n\nThe activities of the 1898 Chautauqua season were to continue and expand from that date to the 1920s, except for the Collegiate Department, which was largely supplanted by the summer session of the University of Colorado beginning in 1904.\n\n1899 \nThe Electric Street Railway from downtown Boulder to Texado Park was started in late April 1899 and completed on June 24, 1899, ten days ahead of the opening of the second Colorado Chautauqua season. Cars ran every 15 minutes from 6:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., and the fare was five cents.\n\nThe first cottages were built in the spring of 1899. At the opening of the second season, between 30 and 40 cottages were available, with the other attenders still residing in tents. Construction of additional cottages continued in later years, although some would stay in tents until 1916.\n\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, the biggest celebrity of the Chautauqua movement, first appeared at the Texas-Colorado Chautauqua on July 12, 1899, drawing a capacity crowd to the Chautauqua Auditorium, with thousands more thronging the adjacent hillsides. The total attendance was about 13,000.\n\n1900 \n\nThe Academic Hall was constructed in June 1900. Cottages built in 1900 included the Women's Christian Temperance Union cottage, which offered rooms to members at 50 cents per night. The prohibitionist cause was a continuing theme in the early days of Chautauqua lectures, as were women's suffrage, Populist politics, and a nondenominational Christian message of self-improvement.\n\nRepublican and Democratic orators were invited to give campaign speeches for their respective presidential candidates, William McKinley and William Jennings Bryan. Jonathan P. Dolliver spoke on August 20, 1900 and Champ Clark the following week. This experiment was not considered a success, and overtly partisan election-year speeches would not return until 1932.\n\nOn December 20, 1900, the Texas-Colorado Chautauqua was reorganized as the Colorado Chautauqua, with an entirely local board of directors. Title to the land remained with the city of Boulder, but the Colorado Chautauqua Association operated the Chautauqua under a long-term lease, since renewed several times.\n\nThe reorganization, partly prompted by financial deficits, had both a broadening and a narrowing effect. More emphasis was placed on wooing attenders from states other than Texas, but at the same time The Colorado Chautauqua had become Boulder's own enterprise. More townspeople attended the presentations in the ensuing years. More Boulderites were also directly involved in managing the Chautauqua programs.\n\nEarly 20th century \n\nThe early years of the 20th century saw continuing growth and development of the Colorado Chautauqua. One highlight was the appearance of John Philip Sousa and his band at Chautauqua Auditorium in the fall of 1904, after the Chautauqua season was over for that year.\n\nIn the first two decades of the Colorado Chautauqua, an average of 40 full evening musical programs were presented each season, which is to say each summer. Dramatic readings from Shakespeare and Ibsen were also staples of the early 20th century Chautauqua experience in Boulder, as were operatic arias. The 1910 program featured \"costumed recitals from grand opera\" presented by the Chicago Operatic Company on July 4.\n\nThe famed evangelist Billy Sunday spoke to large crowds in 1909, 1924, 1925, and 1931. Other evangelists also delivered their message of fire and brimstone to the Chautauquans. According to Chautauqua tradition, all religious observance and preaching was nondenominational, but the growing tide of Fundamentalism made its influence felt through a number of Chautauqua orators as the 20th century progressed.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Colorado Chautauqua, two or three motion pictures had been presented each year. But starting with the 1918 season, in the face of higher costs for lecturers and entertainers, the Colorado Chautauqua Association decided to increase the number of movies. The Association expressed the intention to maintain the quality of the live stage presentations, although those events would be fewer. They also pledged that the motion pictures selected would be the \"best productions on the screen\" and would be limited to films that were morally uplifting and suitable for family viewing. Since the Chautauqua lacked the financial resources to compete for first run films with the commercial movie theaters, second-run movies were selected. The 1918 Colorado Chautauqua movie menu included Oliver Twist, The Bluebird, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, and The Vicar of Wakefield, among others.\n\nFrom 1918 forward, about half of the evening presentations were motion pictures, the other half continuing to be lectures and live entertainment. That formula held for about ten years, after which the movies came to occupy a steadily increasing percentage of the Chautauqua presentations.\n\nMiddle 20th century \n\nEventually the effects of two world wars, one Great Depression, and the development of many competing entertainment opportunities (especially movies, radio, television, and the automobile) would greatly impact the nature of events held at the Colorado Chautauqua. Under financial pressure, the presentations decreased in variety. Although the Colorado Chautauqua Association continued to schedule a few lectures and musical performances (including annual appearances by groups representing SPEBSQSA and the Sweet Adelines, which persist into the 21st century), by the 1950s the vast majority of activities at the Chautauqua consisted of second-run movies in the Auditorium, presented with marginal projection and sound equipment. The Colorado Chautauqua had entered a dormant period, although some traditions continued, such as the nondenominational summer Sunday School program.\n\nThe built-up area of the city of Boulder gradually expanded, reaching the boundaries of the Chautauqua site by the 1940s. Chautauqua became part of the city, although it was still at the edge of the City of Boulder Mountain Parks. Over the years many of the cottages were winterized for year-round use. The Colorado Chautauqua became, in part, a residential district for Boulderites.\n\nLate 20th century \nThe 1970s saw a crisis in the history of the Colorado Chautauqua. Attendance and revenue were declining. The buildings were deteriorating. The Chautauqua Association's 1941 lease on the land was scheduled to expire in 1981. The city of Boulder was entertaining various ideas for the Chautauqua grounds including demolition in favor of building a new convention center on the site.\n\nIn 1974, Daily Camera editor Laurence Paddock completed an application to list the Chautauqua Auditorium on the National Register of Historic Places. When this listing came about in 1978, the city shifted its planning from demolition to restoration. The historic preservation designation of the Auditorium was the turning point for The Colorado Chautauqua as it exists today.\n\nThe Colorado Chautauqua gradually returned to its roots in the late 20th century, scheduling much more live music and a modest number of additional lectures. Jazz and bluegrass concerts were introduced, with good popular success. Guest performers have included composer-pianist Peter Kater, Native American flutist R. Carlos Nakai, Doc Watson, Hot Rize, George Winston, Bill Monroe, Lyle Lovett, Randy Newman, Bobby McFerrin, Bruce Cockburn, Suzanne Vega, Bela Fleck, Roger McGuinn, Loudon Wainwright III, Michelle Shocked, and the Boulder Philharmonic Orchestra, among others.\n\nThe biggest positive impact on the Chautauqua was the arrival, in 1978, of the Colorado Music Festival including the Festival Orchestra under the direction of Giora Bernstein, in residence each summer for dozens of performances. The Colorado Music Festival remains an annual summer fixture at Chautauqua (more recently under the direction of Michael Christie) into the 21st century, presenting a variety of music with the most commonly featured composers being Mozart, Stravinsky, and Beethoven.\n\nChautauqua audiences of the late 20th century have enjoyed lectures from Hunter S. Thompson, Al Gore, Jesse Jackson, Colorado governor Roy Romer, and Congressman David Skaggs of Colorado, among others. Political campaign speeches were brought back to the Chautauqua in the 1996 season for the first time since 1932.\n\nIn response to competition from home VCRs, the second-run family films were discontinued in 1995. The Chautauqua film tradition continues, however, with a silent film series that began in 1986 and persists into the 21st century, featuring live piano accompaniment by Hank Troy and other students of Photoplay music.\n\nThe Dining Hall was refurbished in 1979 and the food service contracted out. For the first time, the Chautauqua Dining Hall became a destination restaurant (which it still is in the 21st century) and ceased to be a financial drain on the Colorado Chautauqua Association. The Dining Hall's license to serve wine and beer, however, represents something of a break with Chautauqua's prohibitionist past.\n\nFrom a near-collapse in the early 1970s, The Colorado Chautauqua recovered to become a permanent part of the Boulder community and a piece of living history.\n\n21st century \nCurrently, during the summer months, The Colorado Chautauqua hosts the Colorado Music Festival (CMF) in the Chautauqua Auditorium. The festival is six weeks long and showcases the Colorado Music Festival Orchestra. Due to its programming by national and international musicians, the festival recently earned recognition from the League of American Orchestras and the National Endowment for the Arts. During the summer 2020 season, the Colorado Music Festival held a series of online concerts due to the Covid-19 global pandemic.\n\nSee also\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Boulder County, Colorado\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n Galey, Mary (1981): The Grand Assembly, The Story of Life at the Colorado Chautauqua.

That same season his backfield mate, Herschel Walker led the league with 1,339 rushing yards.  This was the third time in professional football that teammates had rushed for over 1,000 yards each in the same season (Csonka/Morris – 1972 and Harris/Bleier – 1976). Subsequently, it was also achieved by Mack/Byner – 1985; Dunn/Vick – 2006; Jacobs/Ward – 2008; Stewart/Williams – 2009 and Jackson/Ingram - 2019.\n\nIn 1985, Carthon played a final season with the Generals, posting 175 carries for 726 yards and 6 touchdowns.\n\nNew York Giants\nIn 1985, Carthon signed as a free agent with the New York Giants.

He was considered a bruising back with superb blocking skills. Carthon was a very durable player, missing only one game out of 76 when he was with the Giants.\n\nCarthon won two championship rings with the Giants, in Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV.

Under Carthon, the Browns had managed a league-low 232 points in 2005 and had only scored 88 points through six games in 2006. Carthon was the third NFL offensive coordinator to be replaced during the 2006 season.\n\nIn early 2008, reports surfaced about a potential reuniting of Carthon and old coach Bill Parcells in Miami. Carthon would not be a candidate for the Miami Dolphins head coaching vacancy, but rather a candidate for offensive coordinator.\n\nCarthon been known as a \"Parcells Guy\", following his former coach from coaching place to place. He has coached under Parcells for the New England Patriots, the New York Jets and, most recently, the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nOn Feb 19, 2009 the Kansas City Chiefs announced that the club added Carthon to head coach Todd Haley’s coaching staff.

Its area is 3,618 km2, and its population is 128,378 (2022). It is 80 km west of the Turkish capital Ankara, on the road to Eskişehir. Its elevation is 853 m.\n\nGeography\nPolatlı is situated at the heart of the high Anatolian Plateau, a large steppe covered with grass. Far from the coast, it has a typical steppe climate. The winters are cold and generally snowy, the summers are hot and dry. Spring and autumn are the wettest seasons (especially the former). Polatlı is one of the most productive agricultural districts in Turkey and is best known for its cereal production, especially barley and wheat. Polatlı is one of Turkey's largest grain stores. Sugar beet, melon and onion are also grown.\n\nHistory\n\nAncient settlement \nThe ancient Phrygian capital Gordion is 10 km from the city of Polatlı.\n\nOn the outskirts of Polatli there is an archaeological mound of the same name, the remains of a multi-layered settlement of the Bronze Age (3rd-2nd millennium BC).  Since the mound was being used by local people as a quarry, rescue excavations of its southern and central parts were carried out in 1949 by the Anglo-Turkish expedition led by Seton Lloyd, and Nuri Gökçe, then the director of the ‘Hittite Museum in Ankara’.\n\nClassical antiquity \nOn his expedition to the east, Alexander the Great cut the famous Gordian Knot, an omen of his coming rule over the whole Asia.  Pessinus, an ancient city on the upper river Sangarios (modern day Sakarya River), is also within the borders of Polatlı.  The mythological Phrygian King Midas is said to have ruled from Pessinus and to be buried here.\n\nPolatlı also occupied an important place in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 as the Battle of Sakarya (August 23-September 13, 1921) was fought here, the utmost eastern point reached by the advancing Greek Army in Anatolia.  There are two memorial burial grounds of those lost in the battle. There is also a monument named Mehmetçik Monument about the battle just  west of Polatlı.\n\nHacıtuğrul mound \nSince the 1970s, excavations by Turkish archaeologists have been carried out near the modern town and train station of Yenidoğan, Polatlı, 15 km northeast of Polatli and 20 km from Gordion. This site, near Hacıtuğrul, is now known as :tr:Hacıtuğrul Höyüğü. The remains of monumental fortifications and other buildings of the city from Phrygian times, which exceeded Gordion in size, were found here. Five burial mounds were found in the vicinity.\n\nComposition\nThere are 95 neighbourhoods in Polatlı District:\n\n Adatoprakpınar\n Avdanlı\n Avşar\n Babayakup\n Basrı\n Beşköprü\n Beyceğiz\n Beylikköprü\n Çamlıca\n Çanakçı\n Çekirdeksiz\n Çimenceğiz\n Cumhuriyet\n Esentepe\n Eskikarsak\n Eskiköseler\n Eskipolatlı\n Fatih\n Gazi\n Gedikli\n Gençali\n Gülpınar\n Gülveren\n Gümüşyaka\n Gündoğan\n Güreş\n Hacımusa\n Hacımuslu\n Hacıosmanoğlu\n Hacıtuğrul\n Hıdırşeyh\n İğciler\n Ilıca\n İnler\n İstiklal\n Kabakköy\n Karaahmet\n Karabenli\n Karacaahmet\n Karahamzalı\n Karailyas\n Karakaya\n Karakuyu\n Karapınar\n Karayavşan\n Kargalı\n Kayabaşı\n Kıranharmanı\n Kızılcakışla\n Kocahacılı\n Kurtuluş\n Kuşcu\n Macun\n Mehmetakif\n Müslüm\n Oğuzlar\n Olukpınar\n Ömerler\n Ördekgölü\n Özyurt\n Poyraz\n Sabanca\n Şabanözü\n Sakarya\n Sarıhalil\n Sarıoba\n Sazlar\n Şehitlik\n Şentepe\n Şeyhali\n Şıhahmetli\n Sinanlı\n Sincik\n Sivri\n Taşpınar\n Tatlıkuyu\n Toydemir\n Tüfekçioğlu\n Türkkarsak\n Türktaciri\n Üçpınar\n Uzunbey\n Yağcıoğlu\n Yağmurbaba\n Yaralı\n Yassıhüyük\n Yeni\n Yenice\n Yenidoğan\n Yeniköseler\n Yenimehmetli\n Yeşilöz\n Yıldızlı\n Yüzükbaşı\n Zafer\n\nPolatlı today\n\nToday, Polatlı is an important district of Ankara on the main road which connects the capital to the west of Turkey. The city has a good range of restaurants, bars, schools and other important amenities but still a quiet rural feel to it, and little social life except cafes, patisseries and window shopping on a Sunday afternoon. There are car repair workshops but otherwise little industry. Polatlı is trying to become an independent province from Ankara and \"we want to be a city\" graffiti can be seen in the town.\n\nThere is a military base here and the Turkish Army Artillery School was established in Polatlı in the early 1940s and is still an important institution in the town.\n\nPolatlıspor is a minor league football club that once climbed into the second league.\n\nThere is a large statue of a kangaroo on the main road into city.\n\nLongwave transmitter \nNear Polatli, there is a longwave broadcasting transmitter, which works on 180 kHz with a transmitter output power of 1200 kW. It uses as antenna a single 250 metres tall mast situated at 39°45'22\"N   32°25'5\"E.

{"id": "4106168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy%20City%20Zoo", "title": "Holy City Zoo", "text": "The Holy City Zoo, which called itself \"the comedian's clubhouse\", was a small but influential comedy club in San Francisco that operated from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s.\n\nDescription\nThe Holy City Zoo was located at 408 Clement Street between 5th and 6th Avenues in San Francisco's Richmond District. It was a tiny dark cavern that had a maximum occupancy of 78. The bar sold beer, wine and soft drinks. There was a small stage set against the back wall. A few stairs stage left led to a small balcony known as \"The John Wilkes Booth.\"\n\nHistory\nThe club got its name from a sign the first owner, Robert Steger, picked up for free at a going-out-of-business sale at the local zoo in Holy City, California. He had stopped there to buy redwood tables and chairs for the club.\n\nAt that time, the Holy City Zoo was a folk music club. The first comedian to play the club on an open mic night was Jim Giovanni, an impressionist, circa 1971. There was no comedy scene at the Holy City Zoo prior to Giovanni's appearance, and he remained at that locale performing comedy nightly for close to three years. Later, other comics looking for a venue found the Zoo and gradually crowded out the folk music.\n\nIn 1975, Steger sold the business to Peter Reines. At first the Zoo continued to offer folk music five nights a week and was closed on Sundays.  Reines was approached by San Francisco comedian Tony DePaul who suggested adding stand-up comedy as another form of entertainment.  A number of comedians were holding shows in the basement of a church and wanted more of a nightclub setting.  Sundays became \"open mike\" nights. It promptly became a very popular event.  Gradually, comedy was expanded to seven nights a week.  Under the promotional and emceeing skills of comedian Tony DePaul, the Zoo gained national and international recognition. The club's first official comedy producer/club manager was John Cantu, who often slept on the stage after the club had closed for the evening.\n\nOpen-mike nights continually ran one or two nights a week throughout the club's existence. Anyone could sign up for a five-minute set, including some comedians who went on to be stars.\n\nIt continued as a full-time comedy club for nearly 20 years. The Zoo was a \"clubhouse\" of sorts for comedians; it was the destination for many after a gig to hang out, gossip, drink, complain about the business, and perhaps catch a glimpse of some big-time headliner working on new material (most notably, Robin Williams, \"who used the club as his neighborhood rehearsal space\").  Television producer George Schlatter first saw Williams when he performed at Holy City, and remarked of him \"...because people could not believe what they were seeing. It was character after character and that unbelievable machine-gun delivery\". Rob Schneider could often be spotted hovering outside the club waiting to go onstage because he was underage. Due to a changing neighborhood and the lack of a full liquor license, the club was never financially solvent, and changed ownership many times. Among the various people who owned or co-owned the Zoo were Steger, Reines, Cantu, Jason Cristoble, Tom Sawyer, talent manager Bob Fisher, comedian Jim Samuels, and, at the end, Gilda and George Forrester (parents of the Zoo's last manager, Tracy Forrester) and Will and Debi Durst (who retained the rights to the \"Holy City Zoo\" trademark).\n\nThe Zoo went out of business at least once in the 1980s, reopening briefly as the Ha-Ha-A-Go-Go (under Tom Sawyer). In 1988, several comedians from the club had been recorded for the making of a George Schlatter-produced two-hour TV special The Comedy Club Special, hosted by Dudley Moore. The Holy City Zoo finally closed for good in 1994 and became a karaoke bar. In the later years, Holy City Zoo had been co-owned by Bob Fisher and Jim Samuels, the latter being the 1982 winner of the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. The final closing of the Zoo was a 24-hour \"farewell marathon\" hosted by Jeremy S. Kramer and ran from midnight August 29 to midnight August 30. Robin Williams said of the club's demise \"like someone pulling the life support on your aunt. It's depressing. The Zoo was the womb\".\n\nOn January 18, 1996, the club was temporarily revived as the non-profit \"The New Zoo\" for weekly open-mic nights on Thursdays at its original location (now called Seaport Tavern). Co-owner Jim Samuels died in 1990 at age 41 so only co-owner Bob Fisher was present and promoting the new revival.\n\nOn April 20, 2011, Bay Area comedy troupe Sylvan Productions began hosting a weekly Wednesday night stand up open mic, and regular Saturday feature showcases at Dirty Trix Saloon, bringing comedy back to the historical location.\n\nList of past performers\n\nThe following is a partial list of comedians and other performers who either got their start or had performances at the Holy City Zoo:\n\nThe Amazing Johnathan\nKevin Nealon\nBill Rafferty\nBobby Slayton\nCarrie Snow\nAisha Tyler\n\nReferences\n\nDefunct comedy clubs in the United States\nEntertainment venues in San Francisco\nCulture of San Francisco\nComedy clubs in California"}
{"id": "4106181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knock%20Off%20%28film%29", "title": "Knock Off (film)", "text": "Knock Off is a 1998 action film directed by Tsui Hark and starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Rob Schneider. The film was released in the United States on September 4, 1998.  The title is a double entendre, as the term colloquially refers to both counterfeit goods as well as targeted killing. The film is one of the last in the world to feature Kai Tak Airport still in use; the airport closed in 1998.\n\nIt was Hark's second and last American film; he returned to Hong Kong after Knock Off, feeling unsatisfied with his work in the United States. The film is also the second collaboration between Van Damme and de Souza, the first film being Street Fighter, released in 1994.\n\nPlot\nRussian agents searching for something underwater find a crate as Hong Kong police close in. They accidentally open the crate and baby dolls float to the surface before being detonated. Some Russian agents and a Hong Kong detective pursuing them survive.\n\nDowntown, Tommy Hendricks is arranging a fashion show for \"V-Six\" Jeans. His business partner, Marcus Ray shows up late after inspecting a warehouse of their goods where he sees several knock-offs, including the exploding dolls, peddled by a Hong Kong gangster, Skinny.  Marcus and Tommy then participate in an annual rickshaw race during which Marcus' adopted brother and friend Eddie cheats to win by switching with a body double. The body double gets kidnapped by Russian agents (looking for Eddie) and Marcus gives chase. Ultimately, the agents kill the fake Eddie; Tommy accidentally throws a can of food at a plainclothes Hong Kong police officer. The police arrest Marcus and Tommy, but release them without charges.\n\nBack at their office, an executive from V-Six, Karen Lee claims a shipment of jeans was counterfeit and Marcus and Tommy are responsible for over $5 million of losses. She agrees to let it go if they go to the warehouse that switched the fake jeans and identify who did it. Meanwhile, the Russian bosses kill the agents who failed to reclaim the dolls and get tipped off by Skinny that V-Six and Hong Kong detective are onto them and are going to their warehouse. When Tommy gets kidnapped at a restaurant, Marcus follows him and finds him talking to his CIA handlers. He is a CIA agent sent to discover the counterfeiters who used Marcus, \"the king of knock offs,\" as his cover.\n\nThat night, before they arrive at the warehouse, a truck bursts out. Marcus gets on top of it and when it ultimately crashes they find it full of tiny discs. Tommy's boss, Harry Johansson determines they are powerful \"nanobombs\" at their base inside a Buddha statue.  Believing Eddie to be in on it, they go to see him. Eddie fingers Skinny as the counterfeiter; he found out they had bombs in the merchandise and tried to have it dumped in the ocean before the Russians found them. He opens a safe to give them proof, but it explodes, killing him. Tommy and Marcus have to fight their way out of the building. Tommy obtains security footage on the way out.\n\nMarcus kidnaps Skinny at his workplace and takes him back to the CIA base in the Buddha. There, the security footage reveals Karen was in the warehouse just before they were. At the office, she handcuffs Tommy and prepares to question him.  After Marcus leaves, the Buddha explodes, and Marcus races to the office to save Tommy. After a fight, she reveals she's CIA as well, and the three team up.  While Marcus changes, the Russians kidnap Karen and Tommy, and Marcus finds a bomb detector in Karen's things. He realizes the jean studs are the nanobombs and checks the computer for the shipping manifest. He and the Hong Kong detective race to the cargo ship where Karen and Tommy are being held.\n\nHarry boards the ship and shoots dead a couple of Russian agents. Tommy is relieved to see Harry on board, but Harry reveals he is a double agent intending to ransom companies for not detonating the nanobombs they have been secretly planting in manufactured goods all over the world. Marcus and the detective board the ship and fight through the remaining Russians, eventually escaping just before Harry detonates it. Karen plants a handful of nanobombs on Harry's boat as well, which explodes. They find the detonator in the water and take it.\n\nTwo hours later, Tommy and Marcus talk in a bar. Tommy still has the detonator. In a distant room, Harry, still alive, is planting nanobombs on a toy. Tommy carelessly activates the detonator, destroying the building Harry is in, in the distance.\n\nCast\nJean-Claude Van Damme as Marcus Ray\nRob Schneider as Tommy Hendricks\nLela Rochon as Karen Lee\nMichael Fitzgerald Wong as Detective Han\nCarman Lee as Ling Ho\nPaul Sorvino as Harry Johansson\nWyman Wong as Eddie Wang\nGlen Chin as Skinny Wang\nWes Wolff as Dinger\nMoses Chan as Officer Wong\n\nProduction\nThe film was announced at the 1997 American Film Market.\n\nThe film’s music was credited to Ron and Russell Mael of American new wave band Sparks. In an interview with historian and critic Aaron Hillis, they noted that, although they maintained a positive friendship with Tsui Hark through their attempts to produce a film adaptation of Mai, the Psychic Girl, due to studio pressure the score ultimately ended up being more the work of additional music composer Varouje Hagopian than them.\n\nRelease\nKnock Off opened in the United States on September 4, 1998.  It took the 4th spot and grossed in $5,516,2311 at 1800 theaters, at an average of $3,064 for the weekend. From there it grossed a total of $10.3 million in US ticket sales.\n\nReception\nKnock Off holds a 10% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 40 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Muddled plot; stiff acting.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"D+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nJoe Leydon of Variety called it \"an exuberantly cheesy action opus\" that is made worth watching by Tsui Hark's directing despite its confusing and formulaic plot. Paul Tatara of CNN wrote that it is \"the most incomprehensible mess I've ever had to sit through\", and Jeff Vice of the Deseret News called it \"incompetent in almost every aspect of filmmaking\".  Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times, however, called it Van Damme's best film to date and said it has crossover appeal due to its humor.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n\n1998 films\n1998 action comedy films\nAmerican action comedy films\nHong Kong action comedy films\n1990s English-language films\nEnglish-language Hong Kong films\nFilms set in Hong Kong\nTriStar Pictures films\nFilms directed by Tsui Hark\nFilms shot in the Philippines\nFilms with screenplays by Steven E. de Souza\nFilms set in 1997\n1990s American films\n1990s Hong Kong films"}

{"id": "4106189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd%20Grantham", "title": "Todd Grantham", "text": "Jeffrey Todd Grantham (born September 13, 1966) is an American football coach who is the defensive line coach for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League (NFL). He previously served as defensive coordinator at the University of Florida.\n\nEarly life and education\nGrantham was born in Pulaski, Virginia and attended nearby Virginia Tech from 1984 to 1988. where he played for coach Frank Beamer in his first season as head coach. He graduated from Virginia Tech in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts in Sports Management. Grantham earned All-American honors his senior year at tackle.\n\nCoaching career\n\nVirginia Tech\nFrom 1990 to 1995 Grantham worked as a coach at his alma mater.\n\nMichigan State\nGrantham worked as the defensive line coach for Michigan State in 1996 and 1997.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\nAfter being promoted to assistant head coach at Michigan State, Grantham was hired by Jim Mora in 1998 to coach the defensive line. His D-Line was one of the catalysts of the biggest turnaround in league history (3–13 to 13–3), ultimately helping the Colts defense compile 56 sacks in two years, which was a club record since moving to Indianapolis. During his tenure in Indianapolis, the Colts had a 29–19 record.\n\nHouston Texans\nAfter Mora was relieved of his duties in Indianapolis, Grantham moved on to the newly formed Houston Texans, joining the staff of former Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator and inaugural Carolina Panthers head coach Dom Capers. Grantham was given much talent to work with from the start, as the Texans acquired Pro Bowl defensive end Gary Walker and nose tackle Seth Payne from the Jacksonville Jaguars in the expansion draft.\n\nIn 2002, his influence was evident on the line as starters Gary Walker, Seth Payne, and Jerry Deloach all posted career highs in tackles. Gary Walker also earned his second Pro Bowl appearance under his tutelage that season.\n\n2003 was a testing year for the line, as Pro Bowler Gary Walker and Seth Payne played a combined six games due to injury. However, Jerry Deloach and Steve Martin filled in with great success, posting a combined 201 tackles. Despite the 5–11 record, there was optimism for the future of the steadily improving defense.\n\n2004 was a break-out year for the Texans. Grantham's line once again made a major contribution, helping the Texans achieve the 13th ranked run defense in the league. Despite the low number of sacks (5.5), they put great pressure on opposing quarterbacks (76 recorded pressures) and helped anchor the defense that was equipped with playmakers such as 2004 1st round draft pick Dunta Robinson, former Ravens linebacker Jamie Sharper, and veteran defensive backs Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman. Despite posting a mediocre 7–9 record, the Texans were poised to start making an impact in the NFL after improving every season since their inception in 2002.\n\nAfter three strong seasons with the Texans, Grantham accepted an offer from Romeo Crennel to become defensive coordinator of the Browns. After he left, the Houston Texans posted a 2–14 record. Capers was fired after the end of the season.\n\nCleveland Browns\nGrantham's first year as coordinator of the Browns defense under head coach Romeo Crennel was an eclectic mix of good and bad. They once again fielded one of the NFL's top pass defenses, actually stepping up in rank from 5th to 4th in the NFL. When starting cornerback Gary Baxter went down with a knee injury that ended his career, Leigh Bodden emerged as a solid playmaker. Overall, their secondary continued to play at a high level. They also ranked 11th in scoring defense despite possessing one of the leagues worst run defenses. Orpheus Roye posted a career high with 88 tackles and also made three sacks.\n\nAfter Michigan State dismissed head coach John L. Smith in 2006, Grantham was one of the candidates to be his replacement. However, Michigan State hired Cincinnati head coach Mark Dantonio.\n\nHe was fired on January 11, 2008, after the 2007 season with the Browns defense ranking 25th against the pass, 27th against the run, and 30th in total yards allowed among 32 teams.\n\nDallas Cowboys \nGrantham served as the defensive line coach for the Dallas Cowboys until the end of the season when he joined the coaching staff at the University of Georgia as defensive coordinator. During Grantham's 2 seasons with Dallas, the Cowboys  improved from 13th (2007) to 2nd (2009) in the league in points allowed.\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs \nIn 2010 Grantham installed a 3–4 defense during his four-year tenure at Georgia. Despite breakdowns in coverage at times, in 2010 the Bulldogs ranked 23rd nationally in total defense and 36th in scoring defense (22.1 points allowed per game). His defense also forced 26 takeaways, over twice as many as Georgia had in 2009 (12), and helped them move from 118th nationally in 2009 to 19th in 2010 in turnover margin.\n\nGeorgia's defense under Grantham finished the 2011 season ranked 5th nationally in total defense, 10th in pass defense and 11th in rush defense. They also finished 2nd in the SEC in sacks (34), tackles for loss (94) and turnovers forced (29). In 2012, despite falling to 32nd nationally in total defense, the unit was revered as one of the top in the country as the team finished the season 12–2, winning the Eastern Division of the SEC. Grantham's defense had some  of the top talent in the country with playmakers at every position including linebackers Jarvis Jones and Alec Ogletree, defensive linemen John Jenkins and Kwame Geathers, cornerback Sanders Commings, and All-American free safety Bacarri Rambo. Jones was Grantham's star player and was once again a consensus All-American in 2012, finishing the regular season leading the nation in tackles for loss, and 3rd in sacks.\n\nGrantham is perhaps most famous for giving University of Florida kicker, Chas Henry, the \"choke\" sign as Henry lined up for the winning kick in the 2010 Florida-Georgia game.   Grantham also was shown on TV in a confrontation with Vanderbilt coach James Franklin after the 2011 Vandy game. He later acknowledged that his actions embarrassed the university and were \"unfortunate\". Neither coach apologized to the other.\n\nUnder him Georgia defense finished No. 45 in the nation in the 2013–2014 season. It was the lowest the Bulldogs finished during Grantham's four-year tenure.\n\nLouisville Cardinals\nIn 2014 Grantham was hired by Bobby Petrino to be his defensive coordinator at the University of Louisville. He was given a five-year guaranteed contract worth $1 million per year.\n\nMississippi State Bulldogs \nIn 2017 Grantham was hired by Dan Mullen to be the defensive coordinator at Mississippi State University. He was given a multi year deal, with financial details not disclosed.  Ironically, Grantham's predecessor at Mississippi State, Peter Sirmon, was hired to be defensive coordinator at the University of Louisville.\n\nFlorida Gators \nOn November 30, 2017, Mullen officially hired Grantham to be his defensive coordinator at Florida. Grantham had previously served as Mullen's defensive coordinator at Mississippi State during the 2017 season. In his first year at Florida, the Gators finished 28th in total defense nationally and 5th in the SEC.

{"id": "4106209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruntruck", "title": "Gruntruck", "text": "Gruntruck is an American rock band formed in 1989 in Seattle, Washington, by vocalist Ben McMillan and drummer Norman Scott, both previously from early Seattle sound pioneers Skin Yard. While in Skin Yard, Norman also briefly joined Soundgarden, and collaborated with Chris Cornell on a lesser-known band, the low frequency power trio Bass Truck. Lead guitarist Tommy Niemeyer from crossover thrash band The Accüsed and bassist Tim Paul, previously of Portland hardcore punk band Final Warning, rounded out the initial, classic line-up. Their sound is described as grunge, and the band focuses more on the metal side of the genre.\n\nHistory\nWhile on tour with Skin Yard, Ben and Norman wrote a song (Paint from Inside Yours) in Tucson, Arizona, which had a vibe that Ben felt was worthy of forming a new band around. Before long Ben, Norman, and Tom began to collaborate on blending Bass Truck's sound with this new material, and brought in Tim Paul on bass to fill out the sound later that year. After several attempts at titling the new lineup, the name Gruntruck came to Ben while out record shopping.\n\nThe band soon recorded a full-length album for Seattle label Empty Records, with Skin Yard alum/legendary producer Jack Endino (Nirvana, Soundgarden) producing with Gary King. Inside Yours was released in 1990, and was released simultaneously in Germany on the Musical Tragedies label. Gruntruck made a video for the song \"Not a Lot to Save\" with Henry Shepherd (brother of Soundgarden bassist Ben) directing, which soon found its way onto MTV.\n\nIn 1991, Gruntruck gained further exposure after opening for Pearl Jam on the night they recorded the music video for the song Even Flow, and during the frenzy of media and record label attention that had descended on Seattle, they signed a multi-album deal with Roadrunner Records. Roadrunner re-released Inside Yours later that same year.\n\nIn 1992, the band recorded their second album, Push, with Endino and King again in charge of production. Roadrunner released it that same year, and also licensed Inside Yours for release in Japan on the Appolon Records label. The track \"Tribe\" was made into a music video and appeared on the soundtrack of the film PCU, also earning an enthusiastic reception on MTV and rotation on the show Headbangers Ball. \n\nThey toured the U.S. and Canada with Alice in Chains in fall of 1992, as well as Europe in the winter of 1993 with Pantera, who were supporting Vulgar Display of Power. According to Sean Kinney, they were Alice in Chains's most supported band at the time, opening alongside the Screaming Trees for Alice in Chains' Dirt tour.\n\nTim left the band shortly after their return to Seattle, and was replaced by Alex Sibbald of The Accüsed.\n\nShortly thereafter, a video was made for Crazy Love, which garnered generous airplay on MTV and a rare snark-free mention on the show Beavis and Butt-Head, where a stunned Butthead mused, \"I must be hallucinating now. I can’t believe they’re playing something cool. These guys rock!\"\n\nFollowing a particularly grueling tour of the States, Norman left the band and was replaced by Josh Sinder, also of The Accüsed.\n\nIn 1996, even though the band was at the height of their popularity, they were struggling to make ends meet while fulfilling contractual obligations to Roadrunner Records. Major record label PolyGram offered to buy out Gruntruck’s contract for $1 million, but Roadrunner refused. Subsequently, on the advice of their attorney, Gruntruck filed for bankruptcy in an attempt to break free of their contract. The label sued to block the bankruptcy petition, resulting in a precedent-setting case that has been cited in subsequent cases, written up in legal journals, and eventually inspiring major congressional legislation. The court ultimately ruled in Gruntruck's favor, but the litigation would exact a severe financial and emotional toll on the band. The lineup of Ben, Tom, Alex and Josh released a three-song EP, Shot, on Betty Records in 1996, with Endino and King producing for a third time. The new lineup attempted to recapture the momentum Gruntruck had enjoyed before the lawsuit by stoking a bidding war for the newly available band. However, at a showcase in Los Angeles with A&R representatives from nearly all of the major labels in attendance, the music industry was uniformly perplexed by singer Ben’s decision to perform with his back to the audience and the band remained unsigned.\n\nIn 1997, the original lineup was reunited after Norman and Tim rejoined to play extensively in local venues, and the band began working on new material together as well as with a side project called Mona Diesel. Some of the songs written during this latter collaboration would find their way back to Gruntruck.\n\nThese new songs were the foundation of what was envisioned as their breakthrough third album, and the original lineup began a two-year journey recording in five different studios in and around Seattle with both Jack Endino and Martin Feveyear (Mudhoney, Screaming Trees, Queens of the Stone Age) producing.\n\nOnce the self-titled third album was complete, the band ramped up their live performances around Seattle in preparation for the album’s release. Then in 2003, the band took what was envisioned to be a brief hiatus to give Ben time to recover from his recent health issues.\n\nThe finished third album languished in the vaults until 2016, when Jack Endino mentioned its existence to Found Recordings head, Scott Blum, who enthusiastically embarked on a journey with the band to bring the album to the world. The self-titled third album, nicknamed 'Phoenix' (which included also the songs of the Mona Diesel era), was released October 13, 2017 by Found Recordings, and the remaining original members will honor the late singer's memory by reuniting for a limited number of live performances with a guest singer later in the year.\n\nDeath of Ben McMillan\nBen McMillan died at age 46 from complications related to diabetes on January 26, 2008.\n\nLegacy\nIn 2017, Metal Injection ranked Gruntruck at number 4 on their list of \"10 Heaviest Grunge Bands\".\n\nMembers\n Ben McMillan - vocals, guitar (1989–2002, deceased)\n Tom Niemeyer - guitar (1989–2002, 2017–present)\n Tim Paul - bass (1989–1993, 1997–2002, 2017–present)\n Norman Scott - drums (1989–1993, 1997–2002, 2017–present)\n Alex Sibbald - bass (1993–1996)\n Josh Sinder - drums (1993–1996)\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n 1990: Inside Yours (empty Records/Roadrunner Records)\n 1992: Push (Roadrunner Records)\n 2017: Gruntruck (The Phoenix Record) (Found Recordings)\n\nSingles & EPs\n 1992: \"Tribe\" (Roadrunner Records)\n 1992: \"Above Me\" (Roadrunner Records)\n 1992: \"Crazy Love\" (Roadrunner Records)\n1996: Shot EP (Betty Records)\n 2017: \"Bar Fly\" (Found Recordings)\n\nCompilations\n 1991: Another Damned Seattle Compilation (Dashboard Hula Girl Records)\n 2005: The All-Star Sessions (Roadrunner Records) - appearance by Tommy Niemeyer, credited as member of Gruntruck\n\nReferences\n\nMusical groups established in 1989\nMusical groups disestablished in 1993\nMusical groups reestablished in 1996\nMusical groups disestablished in 2002\nAmerican alternative metal musical groups\nAmerican grunge groups\nMusical groups from Seattle\nHeavy metal musical groups from Washington (state)"}

{"id": "4106223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Ctomo%20S%C5%8Drin", "title": "Ōtomo Sōrin", "text": ", also known as Fujiwara no Yoshishige (藤原 義鎮) or Ōtomo Yoshishige (大友 義鎮), was a Japanese feudal lord (daimyō) of the Ōtomo clan, one of the few to have converted to Roman Catholicism (Christianity). The eldest son of , he inherited the Funai Domain, on Kyūshū, Japan's southernmost main island, from his father. He is perhaps most significant for having appealed to Toyotomi Hideyoshi to intervene in Kyūshū against the Shimazu clan, thus spurring Hideyoshi's Kyūshū Campaign of 1587.\n\nEarly life\nIn 1545, Sōrin married Lady Nata (Jezebel) who became one of the leading personalities against the spread of Christianity in western Japan. She was the daughter of Nata Akimoto, the head priest of the Nata Hachiman Shrine. Sōrin's domain included the port of Funai, which was frequented by Jesuit priests, bandits, Chinese merchants, and Japanese sea lords. In addition to unifying much of Kyūshū under his control, and securing a significant gain in his clan's power and prestige therefore, Sōrin is also quite significant as one of the daimyōs to meet personally with the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier in 1551, one of the first Europeans in Japan. Though he later formally converted to Christianity, it is likely that Sōrin saw this as a strategic move, politically, and was not religiously motivated towards this position. Referred to as the \"King of Bungo\" in the Jesuit records, Sōrin sent political delegations to Goa in the 1550s, and the Tenshō embassy to Rome in 1582.\n\nIn addition to fostering relations with the Christians, Yoshishige fought a number of battles over the course of the 1550s, both gaining and consolidating territory. He defeated Kikuchi Yoshimune in 1551, and the warrior monks of Usa five years later; in 1557 he defeated Akizuki Kiyotane and seized Chikuzen Province.\n\nIn 1562, Yoshishige adopted the name \"Sanbisai Sōrin\" upon becoming a Buddhist monk, but remains best known as Ōtomo Sōrin, despite converting to Christianity under the baptismal name Francisco in 1578.\n\nConflict with Mori\nIn 1557, Ōuchi Yoshinaga (Sorin's younger brother) was forced to commit suicide by Mōri Motonari, and in 1558 Mori captured Moji castle from the Ouchi.\n\nIn September 1559, Ōtomo Sōrin then turned against the Mōri clan. He recaptured Moji castle. The Mōri, led by Kobayakawa Takakage and Ura Munekatsu, quickly took the castle again.\n\nIn 1561, Ōtomo Sōrin, in alliance with the Portuguese, laid siege to Moji. Ōtomo led an all-out assault on the castle but failed, and the castle finally remained in Mōri possession.\n\nThe head of the Mōri at that time, Mōri Takamoto, was assisted by the Shōgun Ashikaga Yoshiteru, which led to a peace treaty between the clans. To secure peace, Sōrin proposed that his daughter marry Takamoto's son, Mōri Terumoto. It is not clear, however, if this offer was ever followed through.\n\nIn 1564, Sōrin was forced to quell a rebellion of the Akizuki clan of Chikuzen province, and then moved against the Ryūzōji clan of Hizen Province, which prompted the interference of the Mōri.\n\nIn 1569, Tachibana Dosetsu, a notable vassal of the Ōtomo, was attacked by the Mori. He was defeated and lost his castle. After Sōrin heard of this, he threatened the Mōri foothold in Buzen Province and attacked them at Tatarahama, forcing the Mōri to retreat and allowing him to retake Tachibana castle.\n\nBy this time, Sōrin controlled Bungo, most of Buzen, Chikuzen, and Chikugo, and had influence over Hugo, Hizen and Iyo, soon became known as the \"Seven-Province Host of the Ōtomo\".\n\nConversion to Christianity \nIn August 1578, Sōrin was baptized as Christian and given the name Francisco. Sōrin, with the urging of the Jesuits, ordered the destruction of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines in his domain. He also ordered the forceful evictions of Buddhist monks and Shinto priests from their religious sites which were then reused as Christian structures. He forced his subjects to convert.\n\nSoon after his conversion, Sōrin and a force of samurais traveled to Tsuchimochi in Hyūga with the aim of establishing a new society based on European Christian principles. Sōrin then sent three captains into the area and ordered them to destroy important Shinto temples, which were then burned. After his conversion to near his death, he and his armies attacked multiple other shrines and temples. Although Sōrin attacked temples and shrines before his conversion to Christianity for political or economic factors, an additional factor, an iconoclastic Christian one, was then intertwined with the other motives for desecration.\n\nConflict with Shimazu\nIn 1578, Sōrin came into conflict with the Shimazu family led by Shimazu Yoshihisa, the only major daimyō family remaining in control of significant portions of Kyūshū. Sōrin attacked Shimazu Takajo castle, but failed to capture the castle and lost at the Battle of Mimigawa.\n\nIn 1585, after Shimazu invasion of Chikuzen Province, Shimazu advanced and captured Iwaya Castle from Otomo's. Later, Sōrin along with the daimyō of the Ryūzōji clan, they appealed to Toyotomi Hideyoshi to aid in holding back the Shimazu, who were beginning to extend their influence over Ōtomo and Ryūzōji lands. Though at first unsuccessful in enlisting Hideyoshi's aid, eventually the Shimazu took up arms against the Ōtomo, Shimazu seize Toshimitsu Castle, Funai Castle and defeated Sōrin at Battle of Hetsugigawa in 1586.\n\nIn 1587, Hideyoshi began his Kyūshū Campaign, in which he overtook the entire island, with the help of the Ōtomo and other families which voluntarily entered his service.\n\nDeath\nIn 1587, Hideyoshi left Kyūshū, restoring the Ōtomo to their domains, taken from them by the Shimazu, and arranging a peace, with all three families officially subject to Hideyoshi and holding the domains, now officially Toyotomi lands, in trust. In June 1587, Ōtomo Sōrin died before this campaign was complete, and so it was his son, Ōtomo Yoshimune, who held the ancestral lands upon the defeat of the Shimazu.\n\nGreat Pillars of Ōtomo\nKamachi Akimori (1520-1578), He was known as a skilled commander in the battle and serve in all Ōtomo Sorin major campaigns. He died in the Battle of Mimigawa.\nTakahashi Shigetane (1548-1586), He began his service beneath the Ōtomo of Bungo Province around this same initial time, with Ōtomo Sōrin as their leader and head.

He is the head football coach at the United States Air Force Academy, a position he has held since the 2007 season.\n\nEarly life and playing career\nCalhoun was born in McMinnville, Oregon in 1966, although his family moved to Roseburg, Oregon when Calhoun was just three years old. Calhoun attended Roseburg High School, where he played football under longtime Roseburg coach Thurman Bell. Along with Bell, Calhoun also counts Dayton High coach Dewey Sullivan—a Calhoun family friend—as an early influence.\n\nCalhoun joined the Air Force Academy in 1985, becoming one of just two freshmen to letter on the 1985 Falcons team that finished 12–1.\n\nCoaching career\n\nAssistant coaching\nAfter graduating from the United States Air Force Academy in 1989, Calhoun served on the Air Force coaching staff under Fisher DeBerry as a graduate assistant during the 1989–90 seasons. After serving out his military commitment, he went on to serve as the Falcons' recruiting coordinator and the junior varsity offensive coordinator over the 1993–94 seasons.\n\nIn 1995, he moved to Ohio University where he served as the quarterbacks coach for two seasons, and was promoted to offensive coordinator in 1997. During his first season with Ohio, his offense had measurable success, particularly in a game against Eastern Michigan, in which the school totaled 612 yards, second most in school history. The team also captured a win against Maryland in 1997, which was Ohio's first victory over a school from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The following week, Ohio fell three points short of defeating Kansas State. In Calhoun's final year at Ohio in 2000, the offense set a school record with 418.1 yards per game and rushed for a school-best 3,553. The Bobcats also ended the season with wins over two bowl teams, Minnesota and Marshall.\n\nCalhoun became offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of Wake Forest University in 2001. During Calhoun's second season, the Demon Deacons led the ACC in total offense with 408.1 yards per game, with a league-best 990 plays and only 16 turnovers.\n\nCalhoun began his NFL career with the Denver Broncos as a defensive assistant in 2003, and later moved to offense and special teams. When Broncos offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak was hired as the Texans' head coach, Kubiak brought Calhoun along and made Calhoun his offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. Calhoun finished out the 2006 season with the Texans before taking over at Air Force.\n\nAir Force\nCalhoun was hired on December 22, 2006 to be the head football coach for Air Force, replacing DeBerry who retired after 23 years as the Falcons' head coach. In his first season as head coach of the Falcons, he took the team to a 9–3 record, and a spot in the Armed Forces Bowl against Cal. On December 4, 2007, Calhoun was named Mountain West Coach of the Year for 2007.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Air Force profile\n\n1966 births\nLiving people\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nAir Force Falcons football coaches\nAir Force Falcons football players\nDenver Broncos coaches\nHouston Texans coaches\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nOhio Bobcats football coaches\nWake Forest Demon Deacons football coaches\nSportspeople from McMinnville, Oregon\nPlayers of American football from Roseburg, Oregon\nCoaches of American football from Oregon\nMilitary personnel from Oregon"}

{"id": "4106269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle%20Shanahan", "title": "Kyle Shanahan", "text": "Kyle Michael Shanahan (born December 14, 1979) is an American football coach who is the head coach for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He came to prominence as the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons, whose offense in 2016 led the league in points scored and helped the team reach Super Bowl LI. Shanahan became the head coach of the 49ers the following season, whom he has led to three playoff runs, two division titles, three NFC Championship Games, and a Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl LIV.\n\nEarly life\nShanahan was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, while his father Mike Shanahan coached at the University of Minnesota. He attended Saratoga High School in Saratoga, California in 1994, while his father worked as offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers.  He later attended Cherry Creek High School in Greenwood Village, Colorado, while his father served as head coach of the Denver Broncos. Shanahan accepted a scholarship offer by Carl Franks of Duke University, but chose to transfer as redshirt freshman to the University of Texas at Austin. Shanahan played wide receiver on a Longhorn team that featured future college coach Major Applewhite as well as future NFL players Roy Williams, Cedric Benson, Bo Scaife, Mike Williams, Quentin Jammer, and Chris Simms. Shanahan caught 14 passes for 127 yards in his career for the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nCoaching career\n\nCollege career\n\nSoon after he graduated from Texas in 2003, Shanahan became graduate assistant to Karl Dorrell at UCLA.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nShanahan was hired as assistant coach for offensive quality control under head coach Jon Gruden with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2004.\n\nHouston Texans\nIn 2006, Shanahan was hired by Gary Kubiak to serve as wide receivers coach for the Houston Texans. Kubiak had previously served as offensive coordinator under Mike Shanahan with the Broncos. At the time, Kyle Shanahan was the youngest position coach in the NFL. A season later, Shanahan received another promotion to become the Texans quarterback coach. In 2007, he had also been offered to become offensive coordinator at the University of Minnesota, where former Broncos assistant Tim Brewster just became head coach. Shanahan declined, citing his decision to be an NFL coach. Shanahan was immediately dealt as the frontrunner for the vacant offensive coordinator position after Mike Sherman had left the Texans to take over as head coach at Texas A&M University.\n\nOn January 11, 2008, Shanahan was officially promoted, becoming the youngest coordinator in the NFL, being more than three years younger than Josh McDaniels of the New England Patriots.\n\nWashington Redskins\nIn 2010, Shanahan left the Texans to join his father, Mike Shanahan,  with the Washington Redskins. The Washington Redskins’ performance during his tenure led some to question whether Shanahan's hiring was an example of unearned nepotism. In 2012, Shanahan was fined $25,000 for insulting the replacement officials and confronting one after a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. On December 30, 2013, Kyle, along with his father and some of the coaching staff, were fired from the Washington Redskins.\n\nCleveland Browns\nOn February 1, 2014, it was reported by media outlets that Shanahan was hired as offensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns. Prior to his hiring by the Browns, Shanahan interviewed for the vacant offensive coordinator jobs held by the Miami Dolphins and Baltimore Ravens. On January 8, 2015, Shanahan resigned from his offensive coordinator position due to friction with head coach Mike Pettine and possibly how the front office was run.\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nOn January 18, 2015, the Atlanta Falcons hired Shanahan as their new offensive coordinator. After going 8–8 in 2015, the Falcons' offense under Shanahan was the highest-scoring offense in the league in 2016 and earned an 11–5 record, a division title, and a Super Bowl LI berth against the New England Patriots. Shanahan was named the NFL Assistant Coach of the Year for the 2016 season.\n\nDuring Super Bowl LI, the Falcons held a 28–3 lead over the Patriots, in part thanks to Shanahan's play-calling and the Falcons' execution of those plays. However, Shanahan was criticized for being too aggressive by not using a ball-control running attack late in the game which resulted in the Falcons losing by a score of 34–28 in overtime.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers\nOn February 6, 2017, one day after the Super Bowl, Shanahan was officially hired as the next head coach of the San Francisco 49ers, signing a six-year deal.\n\n2017 season\n\nShanahan won his first preseason game 27–17 against the Kansas City Chiefs on August 11, 2017. However, the 49ers had begun the season 0–9. On November 12, 2017, Shanahan won his first regular-season game against the New York Giants by a score of 31–21. Three weeks later, he led the 49ers to a 15–14 victory over the Chicago Bears, which marked the first start for quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo as a 49er. On December 31, 2017, the last day of the 2017 NFL regular season, Shanahan and the 49ers defeated the Los Angeles Rams 34–13, ending the season on a five-game win streak and winning six out of the last seven games.\n\n2018 season\n\nThe 49ers managed to win only four games in 2018. The team was impacted by an early season-ending torn ACL to starting quarterback Garoppolo. Garoppolo's injury was immediately viewed as ruining the 49ers hopes for the season, despite Shanahan's optimistic outlook on Garoppolo's replacement, C. J. Beathard.\n\n2019 season\n\nThe 49ers won their first eight games of the 2019 season, making Shanahan only the third coach, along with Tom Landry and Marvin Lewis to begin 8–0 after an earlier 0–8 season start. The 49ers finished the regular season with a 13–3 record, winning the NFC West division title and securing the #1 seed which gave the team home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\nThe 49ers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 27–10 in the Divisional Round and advanced to the NFC Championship, where they beat the Green Bay Packers 37–20 and advanced to Super Bowl LIV, where they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 31–20.\n\n2020 season\n\nOn June 15, 2020, the 49ers signed Shanahan to a new six-year contract extension through the 2025 season. Shanahan was fined $100,000 by the NFL for not properly wearing a face mask, as required for coaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, during a Week 2 game in the 2020 NFL season on September 21, 2020. The 49ers suffered multiple injuries to key starters throughout the season and missed the playoffs, finishing the season with a 6–10 record.\n\n2021 season\n\nShanahan was fined $50,000 by the NFL on July 1, 2021, for violating practice rules during organized team activities.  After starting the season 3–5, the 49ers won seven of their last nine games to finish 10–7 and enter the postseason as a wild card team. The 49ers defeated the Dallas Cowboys 23–17 in the Wild Card Round and defeated the Green Bay Packers 13–10 in the Divisional Round, before losing 20–17 in the NFC Championship to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Los Angeles Rams.\n\n2022 season\n\nIn the 2022 season, Shanahan led the 49ers to a 13–4 regular season mark, which earned the team the NFC West title and the #2 seed in the NFC for the postseason.   The 49ers accomplished their regular season success in spite of injuries to Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. The emergence of rookie Brock Purdy as the team's starting quarterback in the latter part of the season contributed to the team's success. Shanahan helped lead the 49ers to a third NFC Championship appearance in four seasons following victories over the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card Round and the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round. In the NFC Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles, the 49ers were forced to substitute Josh Johnson in for an injured Purdy. Johnson eventually went down to injury as well. Purdy was ineffective due to his injury but finished the game. The Eagles won 31–7.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nPersonal life\nShanahan and his wife have three children, Stella, Carter and Lexi.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Coaching record at Pro-Football-Reference.com\n San Francisco 49ers bio\n\n1979 births\nLiving people\nAmerican football wide receivers\nAmerican Roman Catholics\nAtlanta Falcons coaches\nCleveland Browns coaches\nHouston Texans coaches\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nSan Francisco 49ers head coaches\nSports coaches from Minneapolis\nTampa Bay Buccaneers coaches\nTexas Longhorns football players\nUCLA Bruins football coaches\nPlayers of American football from Minneapolis"}

{"id": "4106285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-referential%20encoding", "title": "Self-referential encoding", "text": "Self-referential encoding is a method of organizing information in one's memory in which one interprets incoming information in relation to oneself, using one's self-concept as a background. Examples include being able to attribute personality traits to oneself or to identify recollected episodes as being personal memories of the past. The implications of self-referential processing are evident in many psychological phenomena. For example, the \"cocktail party effect\" notes that people attend to the sound of their names even during other conversation or more prominent, distracting noise. Also, people tend to evaluate things related to themselves more positively (This is thought to be an aspect of implicit self-esteem). For example, people tend to prefer their own initials over other letters. The self-reference effect (SRE) has received the most attention through investigations into memory. The concepts of self-referential encoding and the SRE rely on the notion that relating information to the self during the process of encoding it in memory facilitates recall, hence the effect of self-reference on memory. In essence, researchers have investigated the potential mnemonic properties of self-reference.\n\nResearch includes investigations into self-schema, self-concept and self-awareness as providing the foundation for self-reference's role in memory. Multiple explanations for the self-reference effect in memory exist, leading to a debate about the underlying processes involved in the self-reference effect. In addition, through the exploration of the self-reference effect, other psychological concepts have been discovered or supported, including simulation theory and the group reference effect.\nAfter researchers developed a concrete understanding of the self-reference effect, many expanded their investigations to consider the self-reference effect in particular groups like those with autism spectrum disorders or those experiencing depression.\n\nSelf-concept and self-schema\nSelf-knowledge can be categorized by structures in memory or schemata. A self-schema is a set of facts or beliefs that one has about themselves. For any given trait, an individual may or may not be \"schematic\"; that is, the individual may or may not think about themselves as to where they stand on that trait. For example, people who think of themselves as very overweight or who identify themselves to a greater extent based on their body weight would be considered \"schematic\" on the attribute of body weight. Thus, many everyday events, such as going out for a meal or discussing a friend's eating habits, could induce thoughts about the self. When people relate information to something that has to do with the self, it facilitates memory. Self-descriptive adjectives that fit into one's self-schema are easier to remember than adjectives not viewed as related to the self. Thus, the self-schema is an aspect of oneself that is used as an encoding structure that brings upon memory of information consistent with one's self-schema. Memories that are elaborate and well encoded are usually the result of self-referent correlations during the process of remembering. During the process of encoding, trait representations are encoded in long term memory either directly or indirectly. When they are directly encoded, it is in terms of relating to the self, and when it is indirectly encoded it is done through spouts of episodic information instead of information about the self.\n\nSelf-schema is often used as somewhat of a database for encoding personal data. The self-schema is also used by paying selective attention to outside information and internalizing that information more deeply in one's memory depending on how much that information relates to their schema. When self-schema is engaged, traits that go along with one's view of themselves are better remembered and recalled.  These traits are also often recalled much better when processed with respect to the self. Similarly, items that are encoded with the self are based on one's self-schema. Processing the information should balance out when recalled for individuals who have a self-schema that goes along with the information.\n\nSelf-schemas do not necessarily only involve individual traits. People self-categorize at different levels that range from more personal to more social. Self-schemas have three main categories which play a role: the personal self, the relational self, and the collective self. The personal self deals with individual level characteristics, the relational self deals with intimate relationship partners, and the collective self deals with group identities, relating to self-important social groups to which one belongs (e.g., one's family or university). Information that is related to any type of self-schema, including group-related knowledge structures facilitates memory.\n\nIn order for the self to be an effective encoding mechanism, it must be a uniform, consistent, well-developed schema. It has been shown that identity exploration leads to the development of self-knowledge which facilitates self-judgments. Identity exploration led to shorter decision times, higher confidence ratings and more intrusions in memory tasks. Previous researchers hypothesized that words compatible with a person's self-schema are easily accessible in memory and are more likely than incompatible words to intrude on a schema-irrelevant memory task. In one experiment, when participants were asked to decide if certain adjectives were \"like me\" or \"not like me,\" they made the decisions faster when the words were compatible with their self-schema.\n\nHowever, despite the existence of the self-reference effect when considering schemata consistent adjectives, the connection between the self and memory can lead to a larger number of mistakes in recognition, commonly referred to as false alarms. Rogers et al. (1979) found that people are more likely to falsely recognize adjectives they had previously designated to be self-descriptive. Expanding on this, Strube et al. (1986) found that false alarms occurred more for self-schema consistent content, presumably because the presence of such words in the schema makes them more accessible in memory.\n\nIn addition to investigating the self-reference effect in regards to schemata consistent information, Strube et al. discussed how counter schemata information relates to this framework. They noted that the pattern of making correct decisions more rapidly did not hold when considering words that countered a person's self-schema, presumably because they were difficult to integrate into memory due to lack of a preexisting structure. That is, they lacked the organizational structure of encoding because they did not fall into the \"like me\" category, and elaboration would not work because prior connections to the adjective did not exist.\n\nSelf-awareness and personality\nTwo of the most common functions of the self receiving significant attention in research are the self-acting to organize the individual's understanding of the social environment, and the self functioning to regulate behavior through self-evaluation. The concept of self-awareness is considered to be the foundational principle for both functions of the self. Some research presents self-awareness in terms of self-focused attention  whereas Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness refers to the encoding of information based on its relevance to the self. Based on the latter interpretation of self-awareness, individuals must identify the aspects of situations that are relevant to themselves and their behavior will be shaped accordingly. Hull and Levy suggest that self-awareness corresponds to the encoding of information cued by self-symbolic stimuli, and examine the idea of self-awareness as a method of encoding. They structured an investigation that examined self-referent encoding in individuals with different levels of self-awareness, predicting that individuals with higher levels of self-consciousness would encode self-relevant information more deeply than other information, and that they would encode it more deeply than individuals with low levels of self-consciousness. The results of their investigation supported their hypothesis that self-focused attention is not enough to explain the role of self-awareness on attribution. Their results suggest that self-awareness leads to increased sensitivity to the situationally defined meanings of behavior, and therefore organizes the individual's understanding of the social environment. The research presented by Hull and Levy led to future research on the encoding of information associated with self-awareness.\n\nIn later research, Hull and colleagues examined the associations between self-referential encoding, self-consciousness and the extent to which a stimulus is consistent with self-knowledge. They first assumed that the encoding of a stimulus is facilitated if an individual's working memory already contains information consistent with the stimulus, and suggested that self-consciousness as an encoding mechanism relies on an individual's self-knowledge. It is known that situational and dispositional factors may activate certain pools of knowledge, moving them into working memory, and guiding the processing of certain stimulus information.\n\nIn order to better understand the idea of activating information in memory, Hull et al. presented an example of how information is activated. They referred to the sentence \"The robber took the money from the bank\". In English, the word bank has two applicable meanings in the context of this sentence (monetary institution and river shore). However, the monetary institution meaning of the word is more highly activated in this context due to the addition of the words robber and money to the sentence, because they are associatively relevant and therefore pull the monetary institution definition for bank into working memory.  Once information is added to working memory, meanings and associations are more easily drawn. Therefore, the meaning of this example sentence is almost universally understood.\n\nIn reference to self-consciousness and self-reference, the connection between self-consciousness and self-referent encoding relies on such information activation. Research suggests that self-consciousness activates knowledge relating to the self, thereby guiding the processing of self-relevant information. Three experiments conducted by Hull and colleagues provided evidence that a manipulation of accessible self-knowledge impacts self-referent encoding based on the self-relevance of such information, individual differences in the accessibility of self-knowledge (self-consciousness) impacts perception, and a mediation relationship exists between self-consciousness and individual differences in self-referential encoding.\n\nSimilar to how self-awareness impacts the availability of self-knowledge and the encoding of self-relevant information, through the development of the self-schema, people develop and maintain certain personality characteristics leading to a variety of behavior patterns. Research has been done on the differences between Type A and Type B behavior patterns, focusing on how people in each group respond to environmental information and their interpretation of the performance of others and themselves. It has been found that Type A behavior is characterized by competitive achievement striving, time urgency and hostility, whereas Type B is usually defined as an absence of Type A characteristics. When investigating causal attributions for hypothetical positive and negative outcomes, Strube et al. found that Type A individuals were more self-serving, in that they took greater responsibility for positive than negative effects. Strube and colleagues argued that this could be a result of the fact that schema-consistent information is more easily remembered and the ease with which past successes and failures are recalled, determined by self-schema, would impact attributions. It is reasonable to believe that Type A's might recall successes more easily and hence be more self-serving.\n\nTheoretical background\nInfluential psychologists Craik and Lockhart laid the groundwork for research focused on self-referential encoding and memory. In 1972 they proposed their Depth of Processing framework which suggests that memory retention depends on how the stimulus material was encoded in memory. Their original research considered structural, phonemic, and semantic encoding tasks, and showed that semantic encoding is the best method to aid in recall. They asked participants to rate 40 descriptive adjectives on one of four tasks; Structural (Big font or small font?), Phonemic (Rhymes with xxx?), Semantic (Means same as xxx?), or Self-reference (Describes you?). This was then followed by an \"incidental recall task\". This is where participants are asked, without prior warning, to recall as many of the words they had seen as possible within a given time limit. Craik and Tulving's original experiment showed that structural and phonemic tasks lead only to \"shallow\" encoding, while the semantic tasks lead to \"deep\" encoding and resulted in better recall.\n\nHowever, in 1977, it was shown that self-relevant or self-descriptive encoding leads to even better recall than semantic tasks. Experts suggest that the call on associative memory required by semantic tasks is what provides the advantage over structural or phonemic tasks, but is not enough to surpass the benefit provided by self-referential encoding. The fact that self-reference was shown to be a stronger memory encoding method than semantic tasks is what led to more significant interest in the field  One early and significant experiment aimed to place self-reference on Craik and Lockhart's depth of processing hierarchy, and suggested that self-reference was a more beneficial encoding method than semantic tasks. In this experiment, participants filled out self-ratings on 84 adjectives. Months later, these participants were revisited and were randomly shown 42 of those words. They then had to select the group of 42 \"revisited\" words out of the total original list. The researchers argued that if the \"self\" was involved in memory retrieval, participants would incorrectly recognize words that were more self-descriptive  In another experiment, subjects answered yes or no to cue questions about 40 adjective in 4 tasks (structural, phonemic, semantic and self-referential) and later had to recall the adjectives. This experiment validated the strength of self-reference as an encoding method, and indicated it developed a stronger memory trace than the semantic task.\n\nResearchers are implementing a new strategy by developing different encoding tasks that enhance memory very similarly to self-referential encoding.  Symons (1990) had findings that went against the norm when he was unable to find evidence of self-schematicity in the self-reference effect.  Another finding was that when referencing gender and religion, there was a low memory recall when compared with referencing the self. A meta-analysis by Symons and Johnson (1997) showed self-reference resulting in better memory in comparison to tasks relying on semantic encoding or other-referent encoding. According to Symons and Johnson, self-referencing questions elicit elaboration and organization in memory, both of which creating a deeper encoding and thus facilitate memory.\n\nTheorists that favor the view that the self has a special role believe that the self leads to more in depth processing, leading to easier recall during self-reference tasks. Theorists also promote the self-schema as being one of the sole inhibitors that allow for recall from deep memory. Thorndyke and Hayes-Roth had the goal of focusing on the process made by the active memory schemata. Sex-typed individuals recall trait adjectives that go along with their sex role more quickly than trait adjectives that are not. During the process of free recall, these individuals also showed more patterns for gender clustering than other sexually typed individuals.\n\nTypes of self-referential encoding tasks\nAs research on self-referential encoding became more prolific, some psychologists took an opportunity to delineate specific self-referential encoding tasks. It is noted that descriptive tasks are those that require participants to determine if a stimulus word can be classified as \"self-descriptive.\" Autobiographical tasks are those that require participants to use the stimulus word as a cue to recall an autobiographical memory. Results from experiments that differentiated between these types of self-referential encoding found that they both produced better recall than semantic tasks, and neither was more advantageous than the other. However, research does suggest that the two types of self-referential encoding do rely on different processes to facilitate memory. In most experiments discussed, these types of self- referential encoding were not differentiated.\n\nIn a typical self-reference task, adjectives are presented and classified as either self-descriptive or not. For example, in a study by Dobson and Shaw, adjectives about the self that were preselected were given to the participants and they decide whether or not the adjectives are self-descriptive.  The basis for making certain judgments, decisions, inferences and decisions is a self-referent encoding task. If two items are classified as self-descriptive there is no reason one trait would not be equally as easy to retrieve as the other on a self-reference task.\n\nExplanations for the self-reference effect\nWhile a significant amount of research supports the existence of the self-reference effect, the processes behind it are not well understood. However, multiple hypotheses have been introduced, and two main arguments have been developed: the elaborative processing hypothesis and the organizational processing hypothesis. Encodings in reference to the self are so elaborate because of the information one has about the self. Information encoded with the self is better remembered than information encoded with reference to something else.\n\nElaboration\nElaboration refers to the encoding of a single word by forming connections between it and other material already stored in memory. By creating these connections between the stimulus word and other material already in memory, multiple routes for retrieval of the stimulus word are formed. Based on the depth of processing framework, memory retention increases as elaboration during encoding increases. The Elaborative Processing Hypothesis would suggest that any encoding task that leads to the development of the most trace elaboration or associations is the best for memory retention. Additional research on the depth of processing hierarchy suggests that self-reference is the superior method of information encoding. The elaborative hypothesis would suggest this is because self-reference creates the most elaborate trace, due to the many links that can be made between the stimulus and information about the self already in memory.\n\nOrganization\nThe organizational processing hypothesis was proposed by Klein and Kihlstrom. This hypothesis suggests that encoding is best prompted by considering stimulus words in relation to one another. This thought process and relational thinking creates word to word associations. These inter-item associations are paths in memory that can be used during retrieval. Also, the category labels that define the relations between stimulus items can be used as item cues. Evidence of the organizational component of encoding is demonstrated through the clustering of words during recall. Word clustering during recall indicates that relational information was used to store the words in memory. Rogers, Kuiper and Kirker showed that self-referential judgments were more likely to encourage organization than semantic ones. Therefore, they suggested the self-reference effect was likely due to the organizational processing endured by self-referential encoding.\n\nStructural, phonemic and semantic tasks within the depth of processing paradigm require words to be considered individually, and lend themselves to an elaborative approach. As such, it can be argued that self-referential encoding is superior because it leads to an indirect division of words into categories: words that describe me versus words that do not. Due to this connection between self-reference and organizational processing, further research has been done on this area. Klein and Kihlstrom's research suggests first that, like previous research, self-reference led to better recall than semantic and structural encoding. Second, they found that self-referentially encoded words were more clustered in recall than words from other tasks, suggesting higher levels of organizational processing. From this they concluded that the organization, not encoding task, is what makes self-referential encoding superior\n\nDual process\nPsychologists Einstein and Hunt showed that both elaborative processing and organizational processing facilitate recall. However, their research argues that the effectiveness of either approach depends on how related the stimulus words are to one another. A list of highly related stimulus words would be better encoded using the elaborative method. The relations between the words would be evident to subjects; therefore, they would not gain any additional pathways for retrieval by encoding the words based on their categorical membership. Instead, the other information gained through elaborative processing would be more beneficial. On the other hand, a list of stimulus words with little relation would be better stored to memory through the organizational method. Since the words have no obvious connection to one another, subjects would likely encode them individually, using an elaborative approach. Since relational information wouldn't be readily detected, focusing on it would add to memory by creating new traces for retrieval. Superior recall was better explained by a combination of elaboration and organization.\n \nUltimately, the exact processes behind self-referential encoding that makes it superior to other encoding tasks are still under debate. Research suggests that if elaborative processing is behind self-referential encoding, a self-referential task should have the same effect as an elaborative task, whereas if organizational processing underlies the self-reference effect self-referential encoding tasks should function like organizational tasks. To test this, Klein and Loftus ran a 3x2 study testing organizational, elaborative and self-referential encoding with lists of 30 related or unrelated words. When participants were asked to memorize the unrelated list, recall and clustering were higher for the organizational task, which produced almost equal results to the self-referential task, suggesting that has an organizational basis. For the list of related words, the elaborative task led to better recall and had matched results to the self-reference task, suggesting an elaborative basis. This research, then, suggests that the self-reference effect cannot be explained by a single type of processing. Instead, self-referential encoding must lead to information in memory that incorporates item specific and relational information.\n\nOverall, the SRE relies on the unique mnemonic aspects of the self. Ultimately, if the research is suggesting that the self has superior elaborative or organizational properties, information related to the self should be more easily remembered and recalled. The research presented suggests that self-referential encoding is superior because it promotes organization and elaboration simultaneously, and provides self-relevant categories that promote recall.\n\nSocial brain science\nThe field of social brain science is aimed at examining the neural foundations of social behavior. Neuroimaging and neuropsychology have led to the examination of neuroanatomy and its connection to psychological topics. Through this research, neuropsychologists have found a connection between social cognitive functioning and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In addition, the mPFC has been connected to reflection and introspection about personal mental states. Supporting these findings, it has been shown that damage to the mPFC is connected to impairments with self-reflection, introspection and daydreaming, as well as social competence, but not other areas of functioning. As such, the mPFC has been connected to self-referential processing.\n\nThe research discussed by those focusing on the neuroanatomy of self-referential processing included similar tasks to the memory and depth of processing research discussed previously. When participants were asked to judge adjectives based in whether or not they were self-descriptive, it was noted that the more self-relevant the trait, the stronger the activation of the mPFC. In addition, it was shown that the mPFC was activated during the appraisal of one's own personality traits, as well as during trait retrieval. One study showed that the more activity in the mPFC during self-referential judgments, the more likely the word was to be remembered on a subsequent surprise memory test. These results suggest that the mPFC is involved in both self-referential processing and in creating self-relevant memories.\n\nMedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation occurs during processing of self-relevant information. When self-referent judgment is more relatable and less negative, the mFPC is activated. Finding support clear cut circuits that have high levels of activation when cognitive and emotional aspects of self-reflection are present. The caudate nucleus has not been associated with self-reference before, however, Fossati and colleagues found activity while participants were retrieving self-relevant trait adjectives. The ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) is also a part of the brain that becomes activated when there are signs of self-referencing and processing. The vACC is activated when self-descriptive information is negative. There is also pCC (posterior cingulate cortex) activity seen in neuroimaging studies during self-referential processing.\n\nDepth of processing or cognitive structure\nGiven all of the neurological support for the effect of self-reference on encoding and memory, there is still a debate in the psychological community about whether or not the self-reference effect signifies a special functional role played by the self in cognition. Generally, this question is met by people that have two opposing views on the processes behind self-reference. On one side of the debate, people believe that the self has special mnemonic abilities because it is a unique cognitive structure. On the other side, people support the arguments described above that suggest there is no special structure, but instead, the self-reference effect is simply a part of the standard depth of processing hierarchy. Since the overall hypothesis is the same for both sides of the debate, that self-relevant material leads to enhanced memory, it is difficult to test them using strictly behavioral measures. Therefore, PET and fMRI scans have been used to see the neural marker of self-referential mental activity.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that areas of the left prefrontal cortex are activated during semantic encoding. Therefore, if the self-reference effect works the same way, as part of the depth of processing hierarchy, the same brain region should be activated when judging traits related to the self. However, if the self has unique mnemonic properties, then self-referential tasks should activate brain regions distinct from those activated during semantic tasks. The field is still at is infancy, but future work on this hypothesis might help to settle the debate about the underlying processes of self-referential encoding.\n\nSimulation theory\nWhile not able to completely settle the debate over the foundation of self-referential processing, studies on the neurological aspect of personality trait judgments did lead to a related, significant result. It has been shown that judging personality traits about oneself and a close friend activated overlapping brain regions, and the activated regions have all been implicated in self-reference. Noting the similarity between making self-judgments and judgments about close others led to the introduction of the simulation theory of empathy. Simulation theory rests on the idea that one can make inferences about others by using the knowledge they have about themselves. In essence, the theory suggests that people use self-reflection to understand or predict the mental state of others. The more similar a person perceives another to be, the more active the mPFC has shown to be, suggesting more deep or intricate self-reference. However, this effect can cause people to make inaccurate judgments about others or to believe that their own opinions are representative of others in general. This misrepresentation is referred to as the false-consensus effect.\n\nExpansion of the SRE: group reference\nIn addition to simulation theory, other expansions of the self-reference effect have been examined. Through studying the self, researchers have found that the self consists of many independent cognitive representations. For example, the personal self composed of individual characteristics is separate from the relational self which is based on relationships with significant others. These two forms of self are again separate from the collective self which corresponds to a particular group identity. Noting the existence of the collective self and the different group identities that combine to form such a self-representation led researchers to question if information stored in reference to a social group identity has the same effects in memory as information stored in reference to the individual self. In essence, researchers questioned if the self-reference effect can be extended to include situations where the self is more socially defined, producing a group-reference effect.\n\nPrevious research supports the idea that the group-reference effect should exist from a theoretical standpoint. First, the self-expansion model argues that individuals incorporate characteristics of their significant others (or other in-group members  into the development of their self-concept. From this model, it is reasonable to conclude that characteristics that are common to both oneself and their significant others (or in-group members) would be more accessible. Second, the previous research discussed suggests that the self-reference effect is due to some combination of organizational, elaborative, mental cueing or evaluative properties of self-referential encoding tasks. Given that we have significant stores of knowledge about our social identities, and such collective identities provide an organizational framework, it is reasonable to assume that a group-reference task would operate similar to that of a self-reference task.\n\nIn order to test these claims, Johnson and colleagues aimed to test whether the self-reference effect generalized to group level identities. Their first study was structured to simply assess if group-reference influenced subsequent memory. In their experiment, they used membership at a particular university as the group of reference. They included group-reference, self-reference and semantic tasks. The experiment replicated the self-reference effect, consistent with previous research. In addition, evidence for a group-reference effect was found.  Group-referenced encoding produced better recall than the semantic tasks, and the level of recall from the group-referenced task was not significantly different from the self-referenced task.\n\nDespite finding evidence of a group-reference effect, Johnson and colleagues pointed out that people identify with numerous groups, each with unique characteristics. Therefore, in order to reach conclusive evidence of a group-reference effect, alternative group targets need to be considered. In a second experiment by Johnson et al., the group of reference was modified to be the family of the individual. This group has fewer exemplars than the pool of university students, and affective considerations of the family as a group should be strong. No specific instructions or definitions were provided for family, allowing individuals to consider either the group as a whole (prototype) or specific exemplars (group). When the experiment was repeated using family as the group of reference, group-reference produced recall as much as self-reference. The mean number of recall for the group-reference was higher than self-reference.  Participants indicated that they considered both the prototype and individual exemplars when responding to the questions, suggesting that the magnitude of the group-reference effect might not be dependent on the number of exemplars in the target group.\n \nBoth experiments presented by Johnson et al. found evidence for the group-reference effect. However, these conclusions are limited to the target groups of university students and family. Other research included gender (males and females) and religion (Jewish) as the reference groups and the group-reference effect on memory was not as evident. The group-reference recall for these two groups was not significantly more advantageous than the semantic task. Questioning what characteristics of reference groups that lead to the group-reference effect, a meta-analysis of all four group-reference conditions was performed. This analysis found that self-reference emerged as the most powerful encoding device; however, evidence was found to support the existence of a group-reference effect. The size of the reference groups and number of specific, individual exemplars was hypothesized to influence the existence of the group-reference effect. In addition, accessibility and level of knowledge about group members may also impact such an effect. So, while university students is a much larger group than family, individual exemplars may be more readily accessible than those in a religious group. Similarly, different cognitive representations were hypothesized to influence the group-reference effect. When a larger group is considered, people may be more likely to consider a prototype which may lead to fewer elaborations and cues later on. Smaller groups may lead to relying on the prototype and specific exemplars. Finally, desirability judgments that influence later processing may be influenced by self-reference and certain group-reference tasks. Individuals may be more sensitive to evaluative implications for the personal self and some group identities, but not others.\n\nGroups are also a major part of the self; therefore we attribute the role that different groups play in our self-concept also play a role in the self-reference effect.  We process information about group members similarly to how we process for ourselves. Recall of remarks referencing our home and our self and group to familiarity of those aspects of our self. Reference to the self and social group and the identity that comes along with being a part of a social group are equally affective for memory. This is especially true when the groups are small, rather than large.\n\nUltimately, the group-reference effect provides evidence to explain the tendency to notice or pay attention to and remember statements made in regard to our home when traveling in a foreign place. Considering the proposal that groups form part of the self, this phenomenon can be considered an extension of the self-reference effect. Similar to the memorable nature of references to a person's individual self, references to social identities are seemed to be privileged in memory as well.\n\nApplications\nOnce the foundation of research on self-referential encoding was established, psychologists began to explore how the concept applied to different groups of people, and connected to different phenomena.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder\nIndividuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can display a wide range of symptoms.  Some of the most common characteristics of individuals with ASDs include impairments with social functioning, language and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and restricted interests. In addition, it is often noted that these individuals are more \"self-focused.\" That is, they have difficulty seeing things from another's perspective. Despite being self-focused, though, research has shown that individuals with ASD's often have difficulty identifying or describing their emotions or the emotions of others. When asked to describe their daily experiences, responses from individuals on the autism spectrum tended to focus more on physical descriptions rather than mental and emotional states. In regards to their social interactions and behavior differences, it is thought that these individuals lack top down control, and therefore, their bottom up decisions remain unchecked. This simply suggests that these individuals cannot use their prior knowledge and memory to make sense of new input, but instead react to each new input individually, compelling them to make a whole picture \n\nNoting the difficulty individuals with ASDs experience with self-awareness, it was thought that they might have difficulty with self-related memory processes. Psychologists questioned if these individuals would show the typical self-reference effect in memory. In one Depth of Processing Study, participants were asked questions about the descriptiveness of certain stimulus words. However, unlike previous DOP studies that focused on phonemic, structural, semantic and self-referential tasks, the tasks were altered for this experiment. To test the referential abilities of individuals with ASD's, the encoding tasks were divided into: \"the self,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word described oneself, \"similar close other,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of one's best friend, \"dissimilar non-close other,\" asking to what extent a stimulus word was descriptive of Harry Potter, and a control group that was asked to determine the number of syllables in each word. Following these encoding tasks, participants were given thirty minutes before a surprise memory task. It was found that individuals with ASD's had no impairment in memory for words encoded in the syllable or dissimilar non-close other condition. However, they had decreased memory for words related to the self.\n\nTherefore, while research suggests that self-referentially encoded information is encoded more deeply than other information, the research on individuals with ASD's showed no advantage for memory recognition with self-reference tasks over semantic encoding tasks. This suggests that individuals with ASD's don't preferentially encode self-relevant information. Psychologists have investigated the biological basis for the decreased self-reference effect among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders and have suggested that it may be due to less specialized neural activity in the mPFC for those individuals. However, while individuals with ASD's showed smaller self-reference effects than the control group, some evidence of a self-reference effect was evident in some cases. This indicates that self-referent impairments are a matter of degree, not total absence.\n\nLombardo and his colleagues measured empathy among individuals with ASD's, and showed that these individuals scored lower than the control group on all empathy measures. This may be a result of the difficulty for these individuals to understand or take the perspective of others, in conjunction with their difficulty identifying emotions. This has implications for simulation theory, because these individuals are unable to use their self-knowledge to make conclusions about similar others.\n\nUltimately, the research suggests that people with ASD's might benefit from being more self-focused. The better their ability to reflect on themselves, the better the can mentalize with others.\n\nDepression\nThere are three possible relations between cognitive processes and  anxiety and depression. The first is whether cognitive processes are actually caused by the onset of clinically diagnosed symptoms of major depression or just generalized sadness or anxiousness. The second is whether emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety are able to be considered as caused by cognitions. And the third is whether different specific cognitive processes are able to be considered associates of different disorders. Kovacs and Beck (1977) posited a schematic model of depression where an already depressed self was primed by outside prompts that negatively impacted cognitive illusions of the world in the eye of oneself. These prompts only led participants to a more depressive series of emotions and behavior. The results from the study done by Derry and Kuiper supported Beck's theory that a negative self-schema is present in people, especially those with depressive disorder. Depressed individuals attribute depressive adjectives to themselves more than nondepressive adjectives. Those suffering from a more mild case of depression have trouble deciphering between the traits of themselves and others which results in a loss of their self-esteem and their negative self-evaluation. A depressive schema is what causes the negativity reported by those suffering from depression. Kuiper and Derry found that self-referent recall enhancement was limited only to nondepressed content.\n\nGenerally, self-focus is association with negative emotions. In particular private self-focus is more strongly associated with depression than public self-focus.  Results from brain-imaging studies shows\nthat during self-referential processing, those with major depressive disorder show greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that depressed individuals may be exhibiting greater cognitive control than\nnon-depressed individuals when processing self-relevant information.\n\nReferences \n\nConceptions of self\nMemory biases\nSelf-reference"}

Caldwell was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa - The National Leadership Honor Society at Wake Forest in 1996.\n\nIn eight years, Caldwell had a record of 26–63.  He installed a powerful passing attack that set numerous school records, many of which have since been broken under his successor, Jim Grobe.  However, his teams rarely ran well; in one year the Demon Deacons' leading rusher only notched 300 yards for the entire season.  He only had one winning season, in 1999, when the Deacons won the Aloha Bowl.\n\nIndianapolis Colts\nCaldwell joined Tony Dungy's staff with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2001 as quarterbacks coach.  He followed Dungy to Indianapolis in 2002 and remained with him for his entire tenure, helping lead the Colts to a win in Super Bowl XLI.\n\nOn January 13, 2008, Caldwell was formally announced as Dungy's successor-in-waiting. On January 12, 2009, Dungy announced his retirement, putting Caldwell in the head coaching position. He was formally introduced at a press conference the following day.\n\nCaldwell had one of the best debut seasons for a head coach in NFL history, finishing with a 14–2 record.  The Colts rushed out to a 14–0 start. With the AFC South title and the top seed in the AFC playoffs secured, Caldwell opted (on orders from then GM, Bill Polian) to sit out his starting players the last two games of the season (both losses), drawing controversy to him and the team.  He later won his first playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens on January 16, 2010. On January 24, 2010, Caldwell became the fifth rookie head coach to lead his team to the Super Bowl after securing a 30–17 win against the New York Jets in the AFC Championship Game. On February 7, 2010, Caldwell's rookie season ended with a 31–17 loss in Super Bowl XLIV to the New Orleans Saints.\n\nCaldwell shares the NFL record for the best start by a rookie head coach, starting his career with 14 wins. George Seifert led the San Francisco 49ers to 14 wins as a rookie head coach in 1989. The 14 wins also tied a Colts franchise record. As of Super Bowl LV, Caldwell is the last rookie head coach to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nIn his second season the Colts posted a 10–6 record but maintained the division title in the AFC South. They lost their first game in the playoffs to the New York Jets, 17–16, on January 8, 2011, marking the end of the Peyton Manning era in Indianapolis.\n\nThe 2011 season, however, saw the Colts sink to 2–14.  Starting quarterback Peyton Manning missed the entire season due to undergoing neck surgeries, and without him the Colts appeared to be a rudderless team. Caldwell was fired after the season. The league-worst record however, gave the Colts the No. 1 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, which they would end up using to draft Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck.\n\nBaltimore Ravens\nThirteen days after his dismissal from the Indianapolis Colts, Caldwell was named quarterbacks coach by the Baltimore Ravens on January 30, 2012. On December 10, 2012, the Ravens dismissed Cam Cameron and named Caldwell the offensive coordinator. On the day after defeating the New England Patriots in the AFC championship game, head coach John Harbaugh announced on January 22, 2013, that Caldwell would be the team's permanent offensive coordinator going into the 2013 season. On February 3, 2013, Caldwell helped lead the Ravens to a 34–31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\n\nDetroit Lions\nOn January 14, 2014, the Detroit Lions announced Caldwell as their new head coach. He was the first African American to hold the position for the Lions.\n\nIn Caldwell's first season with the Lions, they posted an 11–5 record and made the playoffs as a wild card. They were defeated in the first round by the Dallas Cowboys, losing by a score of 24–20.\n\nHalfway through the 2015 season, the Lions had struggled to a 1–7 record, and both team president Tom Lewand and general manager Martin Mayhew were fired. There was speculation that Caldwell would soon be fired as well, but the next week the Lions won a road game against the Green Bay Packers for the first time since 1991. Ultimately, Detroit won 6 of their final 8 games to finish the season with a 7–9 record, and Caldwell retained his job.\n\nIn 2016, Caldwell's third season in Detroit, the Lions improved to a 9–7 record and lost to the Packers in a Week 17 game that determined the winner of NFC North. The Lions clinched another wild card berth, but lost in the first round to the Seattle Seahawks, 26–6.\n\nThe Lions went 9–7 again in 2017, in a season widely considered a disappointment despite the Lions' winning record. After the Lions missed the playoffs following a mediocre performance in the second half of the season, there was speculation about Caldwell's future, given the team's performance and belief that Lions general manager Bob Quinn, who was hired during Caldwell's second year, may have wanted to bring in a coach from his former team, the New England Patriots. Subsequently, on January 1, 2018, the day after the season ended, Caldwell was fired by the Lions. He was succeeded by Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia the following month. The firing of Caldwell drew retrospective contention due to the team not showing improvement during his tenure, but regressing under Patricia.\n\nCaldwell's record as Lions coach was 36–28 (.563), making him the first non-interim Lions coach to leave the team with a winning record since Joe Schmidt, who led the team from 1967 to 1972. His .563 winning percentage was also the best for a Lions' head coach since Buddy Parker in the 1950s.\n\nXFL\nAfter being released from Detroit at the end of the 2017 NFL season, Caldwell was hired by the reincarnated XFL to a consulting panel that addressed football rules for the league.\n\nCaldwell was interviewed in December 2018 by the Green Bay Packers for their open head coach position that was previously held by Mike McCarthy until being let go mid-season in 2018. Caldwell also interviewed for head coaching vacancies with the New York Jets and the Cleveland Browns.\n\nMiami Dolphins\nAfter the Miami Dolphins hired Brian Flores as their new head coach, Caldwell was hired to Flores' staff as assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach on February 8, 2019. On July 13, 2019, it was announced Caldwell would take a leave of absence to address health issues, but remained as a consultant. Following the 2019 season, Caldwell was not retained by the Dolphins.\n\nOn January 4, 2022, Caldwell interviewed to become the next head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars. On January 15, he completed an interview for the head coaching job at the Chicago Bears. He was later interviewed for a second time by new general manager Ryan Poles on January 25.\n\nCaldwell not receiving another head coaching opportunity since 2017, along with his dismissals from the Colts and Lions, were cited by Flores as examples of the league's racial discrimination in his 2022 class-action lawsuit against the NFL.\n\nCarolina Panthers\nOn January 9, 2023, Caldwell was interviewed as a candidate for the Carolina Panthers' head coach position.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, Caldwell was named a senior assistant for the Panthers under new head coach Frank Reich.\n\nFamily\nCaldwell and his wife, Cheryl, have four children: Jimmy, Jermaine, Jared and Natalie.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nCollege\n\nNFL\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n ESPN profile\n\n1955 births\nLiving people\nAfrican-American coaches of American football\nAfrican-American players of American football\nAmerican football defensive backs\nBaltimore Ravens coaches\nCarolina Panthers coaches\nColorado Buffaloes football coaches\nDetroit Lions head coaches\nIndianapolis Colts coaches\nIndianapolis Colts head coaches\nIowa Hawkeyes football coaches\nIowa Hawkeyes football players\nLouisville Cardinals football coaches\nMiami Dolphins coaches\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nNorthwestern Wildcats football coaches\nPenn State Nittany Lions football coaches\nPlayers of American football from Wisconsin\nSouthern Illinois Salukis football coaches\nSportspeople from Beloit, Wisconsin\nTampa Bay Buccaneers coaches\nWake Forest Demon Deacons football coaches\n21st-century African-American sportspeople\n20th-century African-American sportspeople"}

The event currently offers a purse of $400,000.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was inaugurated 16 March 1973 as the Louisiana Derby Trial with handicap conditions over a distance of one mile and forty yards with the Indiana bred colt Navajo victorious by one length over Smooth Dancer with Assagai Jr. in third place. The time run by the winner was 1:40 flat. Navajo received free entry into the Louisiana Derby and finished second to Leo's Pisces. Later that year Navajo ran in the Kentucky Derby and finished seventh to Secretariat.\n\nThe event as a trial race immediately became a major prep for the Louisiana Derby.\n\nIn 1975 the event was increased to  miles and was won by Master Derby. Master Derby followed up winning the Louisiana Derby. Later in his Triple Crown campaign, Master Derby was victorious in the Preakness.\n\nThe event was shortened back to its inaugural distance in 1988 of 1 mile and 40 yards. The event that year was won by Risen Star who  went on to win the Preakness and Belmont Stakes and be voted the 1988 Eclipse Award for American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. The following year the track renamed the event in honor of Risen Star to the Risen Star Stakes.\n\nIn 1991 the distance of the event was increased to  miles and in 2002 the American Graded Stakes Committee upgraded the race to Grade III. The event was upgraded once more in 2010 to Grade II.\n\nThe Risen Star Stakes was run in two divisions in 1989, 1993, 1995 and 2020.\n\nNo winner of the Risen Star Stakes has gone on to win the Kentucky Derby. However, two runners who have run in the event have gone on to win the Run for the Roses. War Emblem finished sixth at Fair Grounds before winning at Churchill Downs in 2002. Country House was second in the Risen Star before crossing second in the 2019 Kentucky Derby, only to be promoted after first-place finisher Maximum Security was disqualified by Kentucky stewards for interference. The Risen Star also has produced two winners of the second leg of the American Triple Crown: Master Derby (1975) and War of Will (2019). It has also produced two winners of the Breeders' Cup Classic: Gun Runner and Mucho Macho Man.\n\nThe event is part of the Road to the Kentucky Derby.\n\nRecords\nSpeed  record:\n miles – 1:49.03  Epicenter  (2022)\n miles – 1:42.80 Zarbs Magic (1996)\n1 mile and 40 yards  – 1:39.80 Heavy Mayonnaise  (1974)\n\nMargins:\n 10 lengths – Badge of Silver (2003)\n\nMost wins by a jockey:\n 3 - Shane P.

A four-time Super Bowl champion, he spent a majority of his coaching career with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Indianapolis Colts.\n\nEarly life\nMoore learned football at an early age in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. He played quarterback at the University of Iowa, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history and became a member of the Iowa Beta chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Moore coached at Iowa after graduation and then joined the Army for two years, when he also coached football overseas.\n\nCoaching career\nMoore resumed his college coaching career at the University of Dayton, where he coached offensive backs and received a graduate degree in guidance counseling. When he left Dayton in 1968, Moore went on to coach offense for nine years at Wake Forest University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Minnesota, and for the New York Stars of the World Football League (WFL).\n\nMoore made the transition to the NFL in 1977 when he joined Chuck Noll's coaching staff at the Pittsburgh Steelers, initially serving as receivers coach. Within three years on the Steelers, Moore earned two Super Bowl rings and in 1983 he was promoted to quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator. For eight years, Moore and Tony Dungy, the Colts' head coach from 2002 to 2009, were colleagues on Noll's coaching staff at Pittsburgh.\n\nLeaving the Steelers in 1990, Moore served in senior offensive coaching roles for three teams in eight years, having the most success as offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions, the team which led the NFL in total offense in 1995 and was the first team in NFL history to have two receivers with over 100 catches in a season (Herman Moore and Brett Perriman).\n\nIndianapolis Colts\nMoore interviewed for the Lions' head coaching job in 2006, but the Lions hired Rod Marinelli.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts, for whom Moore served as an offensive coordinator since 1998, won Super Bowl XLI in February 2007.  Moore coached the offense under head coaches Jim Mora, Dungy and Jim Caldwell.  He oversaw the development of quarterback Peyton Manning for Manning's entire tenure with the Colts. Manning started every single game for the Colts over that time period, going 117–59 in the regular season and 9–9 in the playoffs, also setting numerous NFL records, including highest passer rating, season (121.1 in 2004, subsequently surpassed by Aaron Rodgers in 2011) and for most passing touchdowns in a season with 49, also in 2004 (since surpassed by Tom Brady, 50 touchdowns in 2007 and by Manning himself with 55 touchdowns in 2013).\n\nOn May 6, 2009, ESPN reported that Moore was planning to retire due to a change in the NFL's pension program which affected both him and the Colts' offensive line coach, Howard Mudd. Larry Kennan, the executive director of the NFL Coaches' Association, said Moore had not yet filed his retirement papers but believed that he was \"just about there.\" On May 20, 2009, Moore returned to the Colts to serve as their senior offensive coordinator, though he ultimately left the organization following the 2010 season. On July 21, 2011, it was announced that Moore would take a job with the New York Jets as a remote working offensive consultant.\n\nArizona Cardinals\nOn January 21, 2013, it was announced Bruce Arians had brought in Tom Moore and to help him overhaul the worst offense in the NFL. Moore served as assistant head coach/offense for the Arizona Cardinals until the end of the 2017 season.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nIn August 2019, it was announced that Moore had agreed to be an offensive consultant for the Buccaneers for the 2019 season. Moore announced his intentions to stay with the team for the 2021 season, which would be his 42nd season in the NFL, before Super Bowl LV. He won his second Super Bowl as a coach and fourth Super Bowl overall when the Buccaneers won Super Bowl LV.\n\nHonors\nIn May 2014, Moore was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in recognition of his 13 seasons as an assistant coach with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nIn 2015, Moore was selected as part of the 2015 class for the Paul “Dr. Z” Zimmerman Award by the Pro Football Writers of America.

{"id": "4106341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic%20%28transit%20bus%29", "title": "Classic (transit bus)", "text": "The Classic was a single-deck bus developed by General Motors Diesel from its previous-generation New Look design. The \"Classic\" was nearly identical to the New Look from the belt rail up, but sported a new front which allowed for a wider front door. The design was originally intended solely for the Canadian market as an alternative to the unpopular Rapid Transit Series (RTS) but ultimately the Classic, produced from 1982 to 1997, met with widespread success in both Canada and the United States. It was available primarily as a  long,  wide coach, although 16  long articulated Classics were manufactured. The design was fairly conservative, yet contemporary and less controversial than the RTS.\n\nHistory\nWhen GMC in the United States decided to replace the New Look with the RTS II series in 1977, they hoped that they would win over operators in both the US and Canada. But the design and the futuristic look turned off most Canadian transit operators. In 1979, GM Canada's Transit division decided to continue producing New Looks until 1982, when it unveiled the Classic. Several orders for New Looks were still accepted, built and delivered until 1986 for U.S. properties, although the buses were made in Canada.\n\nThe Classic proved to be a popular in the U.S. as well, where the Utah Transit Authority would be the first American operator, in 1983, to order the buses (the first order in 1983 was 39, followed by 63 in 1984 and 66 in 1990), which was later followed by orders from DDOT (Detroit), Grand Rapids, Connecticut Transit, Big Blue Bus (Santa Monica), and the contract bus operators serving the New York City metropolitan area (who used single-door Classics for commuter routes).\n\nIn 1987 GM sold the transit bus division to Motor Coach Industries (MCI). By 1993 the bus division changed hands again, this time going to NovaBus. During the two transitions the Classic continued to be built until NovaBus discontinued the model in 1997, as most agencies preferred the new low-floor LFS design. The last Classics were built in 1997, for the Société de transport de l'Outaouais (STO) of Gatineau, Quebec. At the same time the RTS model was discontinued, leaving the LFS and its derivatives as the only bus available from NovaBus.\n\nNovaBus also assembled Classics in the US in 1995 and 1996 from its now-closed plant in New York state. They were delivered to Buffalo, Connecticut, Rochester, the suburbs of Chicago (Pace), and Pittsburgh, the last US transit agency to receive Classics (NovaBus took over the Port Authority Transit contract after previous awardees such as Flxible went bankrupt in 1995). These agencies have retired the American-built units, but some have been refurbished and rebuilt by third-party distributors.\n\nRetirements\nAs of 2020, the STO was still running Classics, but they have now all been retired with the arrival of the 2020 NovaBus LFS HEV buses. Pittsburgh, Montreal (including Laval and the South Shore agencies), Ottawa, Buffalo, Halifax, Lévis, Toronto, Santa Monica, Connecticut, Rochester, PACE, Quebec City, Windsor and Winnipeg have retired most of their Classics due to increasing maintenance costs, difficulty in obtaining replacement parts, and the agencies' plans to convert to low-floor fleets. However, a few transit agencies began purchasing used Classics due to rising costs and lack of funding for new buses. Regina Transit had acquired used Classics due to provincial and government funding issues, which lasted until early 2014, when they received funding for new buses and to retire their last MCI Classics, becoming 100% low-floor. Metrobus Transit (St. John's, NL) retired their last Classics in January 2016, Calgary Transit retired their last Classics on December 18, 2014, and their fleet is completely accessible as some were sold to STO and Saskatoon Transit, the latter having retired its Classic fleet in 2018. Quebec City's Réseau de transport de la Capitale retired its last Classic on March 3, 2016. NFTA Metro's Classics retired in 2016 when the NovaBus LFS CNG buses arrived. A former 1986 Hamilton Street Railway Classic (HSR 8602) that was retired in 2002 was featured as part of a redecorating sketch in a 2005 episode of The Red Green Show.\n\nPreservation\nAs of 2020, Classics from Vancouver, Calgary, Connecticut, Montreal, New York City, Saskatoon, Santa Monica, Toronto and Winnipeg have been preserved by local non-profit bus groups. OC Transpo GM Classic 8776 has been preserved by a private individual as of 2017. A private operator owns a 1994 NovaBus Classic that was retired from Quebec City. Utah Transit Authority has retained MCI Classic 9066 as part of their preservation fleet.\n\nAll 16 of the articulated buses were scrapped upon retirement, but some parts from the Halifax Transit fleet were saved for use on their remaining refurbished Classics.\n\nModels\nThe model designations used for Classics consisted of two letters followed by a series of five numbers then another letter. The only versions built were the TC40-102A, TC40-102N and the TA60-102N. All were equipped with an automatic transmission. (Some TC40-102As with no center exits have been erroneously identified as SC40-102As, but a true Suburban version would have had all forward-facing seats, no center exit, a lowered center aisle and underfloor baggage compartments.)\n\nThe 60-foot version was not introduced until 1992, after MCI purchased the Classic design, and only 16 of these articulateds were ever built: 14 for Halifax Transit (Formerly Metro Transit), and two to Réseau de transport de la Capitale (RTC) (Quebec City, Quebec). NovaBus discontinued the articulated Classic in 1993. (This bus is not to be confused with the New Look TA60-102N, a 60-foot articulated bus manufactured by GMC in 1982, which had a Classic front end grafted onto a New Look body, which allowed for a wider front entrance.)\n\nSeating capacity ranged from 39 to 52, and included wheelchair lifts which were optional for Canadian operators but were required for American operators, to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n\nThere were many optional features for the Classics, including the rear exit doors. Most orders specified the wide versions, but a narrower single-stream door was also available. A majority of orders had either large or no rear windows, but a few opted for a small rear window at the top of the rear cap. The rear window was dropped as an option for US-built buses due to revised air conditioning equipment and a stand-out exhaust deflector that extended the upper half of the rear cap by a few inches. The American-built Classics also had a larger front door due to having handicapped lifts installed. Another modification during the production run was the size of the front destination sign. A taller and wider version was offered from 1990 as more transit systems specified larger electronic signs. The major exception was Montreal, as MCI and NovaBus built an \"M-version\" which retained the narrow destination sign windows, and was ordered primarily by properties in the Montreal area.\n\nNeither a 35-foot long nor a 96-inch wide version of the Classic was ever made. However, GM, MCI and NovaBus did build a commuter version with all forward-facing seats and no center exit.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2005, Dupont Industries, a Quebec City-based company, refurbished and rebuild retired Classics into trolley-like sightseeing buses. Dupont's refurbished Classic was called a Dupont Cartier.\n\nManufacturers\n\nSee also \n\n List of buses\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nGM/MCI/Nova Bus Classic (transit buses) fan page at Flickr\nPhotos of Classics from Bus Explorer\nSTM Classics\nRochester, New York Classics\nPort Authority of Allegheny County (Pittsburgh) Novabus Classics\nYahoo Groups: Classic Bus\n\nGM Classic\nBuses of Canada\nBuses of the United States\nGeneral Motors buses\nMotor Coach Industries\nIntercity buses\nSingle-deck buses\nArticulated buses\nVehicles introduced in 1982"}

It is located on the R405 regional road, approximately halfway between Celbridge and Newcastle. The Grand Canal passes through the area, and Hazelhatch is one of the places of recreational activity along the Grand Canal, with fishing and boating. There is one pub in Hazelhatch, beside the canal. Although there is no conventional village centre, there is a concentration of one-off houses in the surrounding area.

Hazelhatch and Celbridge railway station opened on 4 August 1846 and closed for goods traffic on 9 June 1947. \n\nDuring the mid 2000's the railway line was expanded from double track to quadruple track, in order to improve the commuter and intercity services. There was a proposal to electrify the line between Hazelhatch and Dublin, but this was shelved following the post-2008 Irish economic downturn. Hazelhatch is referred by railwaymen and trainspotters as 'The Hatch'. Nearby Stacumny Bridge is one of the most popular places in Ireland for trainspotting due to the quadruple tracks, the frequency and high speeds of trains and the freight and engineering trains that must pass here leaving Dublin.\n\nHazelhatch is located equidistant from the M4 at Celbridge and the N7 Naas Road. Other nearby places include Lyons House, Stacumny House and Ardclough.\n\nReferences\n\nGeography of County Kildare\nPlaces in South Dublin (county)\nTownlands of County Dublin"}
{"id": "4106353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill%20Banner", "title": "Jill Banner", "text": "Jill Banner (born Mary Molumby, November 8, 1946 – August 7, 1982) was an American film actress. She played Virginia, the \"spider baby\" in the 1968 cult horror-comedy film Spider Baby. She also had roles as James Coburn's flower child friend in The President's Analyst (1967), and appearances in Jack Webb's television series, Dragnet.\n\nEarly life\n\nBanner was born in Bremerton, Washington. After her father's death in 1949, she and her mother lived in South Dakota and Iowa, near relatives, finally ending up in Glendale, California. She studied at the Hollywood Professional School, a K-12 school for working professional children run by Maurice and Bertha Mann, where classes typically ran from 8:45 AM to 12:45 PM, allowing the students the afternoon off to pursue various jobs or performing careers. The school assemblies, called \"Aud. Calls\", were early showcases for the talents of students aspiring to be dancers, singers, and actors. She graduated in 1964.\n\nFilm and television\nBanner's film acting began in 1964 with Spider Baby, also starring Sid Haig and Lon Chaney Jr. and directed by Jack Hill. However, the film was tied up in litigation and was not released until 1967 under various titles, including Attack of the Liver Eaters, Cannibal Orgy, and The Maddest Story Ever Told. The black and white feature quickly faded from view. Spider Baby became known largely through the efforts of Los Angeles cult film resurrectionist Johnny Legend. The film tells the story of the Merrye family, who suffer from a degenerative disease. While Spider Baby remained in legal limbo, Banner was uncredited in Deadlier Than the Male (1966), a British mystery about two female assassins. In 1967, she played Wendy, a wholesome teenager, in C'mon, Let's Live a Little, one of the last of the Beach party films, and as Caroline in the Spaghetti Western The Stranger Returns.\n\nIn the psychedelically paranoid spy spoof The President's Analyst (1967), Banner played a flower child named \"Snow White\" who temporarily rescues Dr. Sidney Schaefer from a combined conspiracy of the American CIA, the Russian KGB, and The Phone Company (referred to cryptically as \"TPC\"). She was featured in several episodes of Jack Webb's police-procedural shows, Dragnet and Adam-12, usually playing clueless teenagers and spaced-out daytrippers.\n\nBanner performed in several movies and TV shows in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Shadow Over Elveron (1968) with Don Ameche and Adam-12 co-star Kent McCord. In The Stranger Returns (also known as Shoot First Laugh Last and Un Uomo, Un Cavallo, Una Pistola), Banner played the pretty daughter of a corrupt postal official who falls into the hands of banditos, only to be rescued by The Stranger. She was also featured in Hunters Are For Killing (1970), an early Burt Reynolds movie. She later appeared in episodes of the television shows The Bold Ones and Cade's County. She had an uncredited bit part in Christian Marquand's 1968 film Candy, but her scene was deleted from the final print.\n\nLater years\nBanner abandoned Hollywood for a real estate job in New Mexico in 1976. Marlon Brando's 1994 autobiography, Songs My Mother Taught Me, discusses the couple's relationship. Banner returned to Southern California in the early 1980s, reportedly to develop scripts.\n\nDeath\nOn August 7, 1982, Banner's Toyota was hit by a truck on the Ventura Freeway. Thrown from the vehicle, she later died at North Hollywood's Riverside Hospital. She was 35 years old. She is interred at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n The Films of Jack Hill\n\n1946 births\n1982 deaths\nAmerican film actresses\nActors from Glendale, California\nActresses from Greater Los Angeles\nRoad incident deaths in California\nBurials at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery\n20th-century American actresses\nBrando family"}
{"id": "4106355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret%20Brundage", "title": "Margaret Brundage", "text": "Margaret Brundage, born Margaret Hedda Johnson (December 9, 1900April 9, 1976), was an American illustrator and painter who is remembered chiefly for having illustrated the pulp magazine Weird Tales. Working in pastels on illustration board, she created most of the covers for Weird Tales between 1933 and 1938.\n\nEarly life\nBrundage was born in Chicago, Illinois, of Swedish and Irish ancestry. Her father, Jonathan Emanuel Johnson, died when she was eight years old; she was raised by her mother Margaret Jane (Loutit) Johnson and grandmother Margaret (Houston) Loutit, for whom she was named, in a Christian Science household. Both her parents had come to Chicago from the Orkney Islands off the coast of Scotland. Brundage's mother remained both a widow and a devout Christian Scientist for the rest of her life, and supplemented their income by instructing beginning Christian Science disciples.\n\nMargaret Hedda Johnson graduated from Girard Grammar School and attended McKinley High School in Chicago, where Walt Disney was a classmate. (\"I finished; he didn't,\" she later remarked.) She graduated from McKinley in 1919. She was editor of the high school newspaper.  Immediately after high school, Margaret worked providing illustrations for Chicago newspapers; she would draw fashion designs in both colour and in black-and-white, from ideas and descriptions provided by an agency.  Her education continued at Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in the 1920s; she later stated that her failure to graduate was due to her inept lettering, though she continued her freelance work for the agency while she completed her coursework.  During this period of the Prohibition, Margaret also worked at the Dill Pickle Club, a bohemian speakeasy affiliated with the Wobblies, where she met a sometime decorator and house painter nicknamed \"Slim\"  due to his spare frame.  This was Myron Reed Brundage, legendary writer, free thinker, and alleged womaniser.\n\nIn 1927, she married Myron \"Slim\" Brundage in Chicago. Brundage was a former hobo, and the founder of the College of Complexes. They had one son, Kerlyn Byrd Brundage (born 27 August 1927; died 1972), always called \"Byrd\". The marriage ended in divorce in 1939.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1932 Brundage was looking for more work, and found herself at the office of Farnsworth Wright, then editor of the weird fiction magazine Weird Tales. Brundage began working for Wright by doing a few covers for his side publication Oriental Stories, later known as The Magic Carpet. Wright was so impressed with these that he hired Brundage to draw for Weird Tales. Over the period from 1933 to 1938, Brundage executed cover art, first for then, famously, for Weird Tales. She was the most frequently-appearing cover artist on Weird Tales during her stint with the magazine. Her first cover appeared on the September 1932 issue; she created covers for 39 straight issues from June 1933 to August 1936. Her last original cover was for the Jan. 1945 issue, for a total of 66 original-artwork covers. (The total of 67, often cited in sources, includes a repeat of that final 1945 cover on the November 1953 issue.) She was paid $90 per cover—enough to support herself, her son, and her invalid mother (died 1940).  From 1936 through 1938, Brundage often alternated with others as cover artist; Virgil Finlay was her chief competitor.\n\nBrundage's art frequently featured damsels in distress in various states of full or partial nudity; her whipping scenes were especially noteworthy and controversial. Her sensual images usually illustrated scenes from the pieces chosen by editor Farnsworth Wright as cover stories; her work was so popular among readers that some WT writers, like Seabury Quinn, cannily included scenes in their stories that would make good Brundage covers, since cover feature stories earned their authors more money.\n\nPulp covers were notorious for their explicit content, and Brundage's were no exception. During this time, it would have been seen as unacceptable for a woman to be creating such material so she signed her work \"M. Brundage\", to keep her identity in the dark for her readers. Complaints about the erotic nature of her work increased after October 1934, when editor Wright revealed that the \"M.\" stood for \"Margaret,\" disclosing that the artist was a woman. After 1938, when the magazine's editorial offices moved from Chicago to New York City, a new 'decency' standard was imposed (primarily through the efforts of then-mayor of New York Fiorello La Guardia) on pulp magazines sold at newsstands, and the nude or semi-nude young women that had been the primary subjects of Brundage's covers were out. Practical problems with shipping Brundage's fragile pastel art from Chicago to New York also diminished her appeal to the editorial regime that followed Wright's 1940 departure.\n\nIn 1939, Brundage painted two covers for Golden Fleece, a Chicago-based pulp magazine that specialized in historical fiction.\n\nShe continued to draw after her relationship with the magazine ended, and appeared at a number of science fiction conventions and art fairs, where some of her original period works were stolen. Yet she never fully recovered financially from the loss of regular work at WT; her later years were spent in relative poverty. She continued to work until her death.\n\nReception\nDuring her period as a Weird Tales cover artist, letters praising Brundage's work appeared in the magazine from Robert E. Howard, Henry Kuttner, and A. Merritt.\n L. Sprague de Camp is often quoted as claiming she used her daughters as models, but Brundage had no daughters. De Camp himself debunked the claim at one point, writing \"About Margaret Brundage's luscious babes on the covers of Weird Tales, a rumor was once rife that Mrs. Brundage used her two daughters as models. Later she said she had no daughters and that, since she couldn't then afford professional models, she cut pictures from magazine advertisements for models. Hence the ubiquitous coiffures of the early 1930s.\" The claim had previously been refuted by Robert Weinberg, an authority on pulp magazines, who wrote in the letters page for Savage Tales magazine, No.5 (July, 1974), \"much as I hate to discredit a good story, WT cover artist Margaret Brundage did not have a daughter who posed for her. As Mrs. Brundage lives in Chicago and I have interviewed her, this is straight from the artist's mouth.\"\n\nL.

In December 1933 he wrote to H. P. Lovecraft: \"The current W.T. design, though pleasing enough in color, is curiously suggestive of a Christmas card!

The best angles in this picture (the hands of the Chinaman, etc) seem to have been swiped by unconscious cerebration from Utpatel's drawing for 'The Star-Spawn' by Derleth and Schorer.\" On September 9, 1937, he wrote to R.

{"id": "4106372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham%20Garden%20Theatre", "title": "Chatham Garden Theatre", "text": "The Chatham Garden Theatre or Chatham Theatre was a playhouse in the Chatham Gardens of New York City. It was located on the north side of Chatham Street on Park Row between Pearl and Duane streets in lower Manhattan. The grounds ran through to Augustus Street. The Chatham Garden Theatre was the first major competition to the high-class Park Theatre, though in its later years it sank to the bottom of New York's stratified theatrical order, below even the Bowery Theatre.\n\nThe Chatham Garden was converted to the Free Presbyterian Chatham Street Chapel in 1832.\n\nCreation and early seasons\nThe theatre began quite humbly. In 1823 Hippolite Barrière, the manager of the Chatham Gardens in New York City, erected a white, canvas tent in his public pleasure grounds. He dubbed it the Pavilion Theatre and began staging drama there with a ticket price of 25¢. The tent, which was used for other concerts and plays, also housed a saloon. The makeshift playhouse operated through the summer, perhaps the first such summer theatre in the United States.\n\nStephen Price, manager of New York's Park Theatre, tried to put a stop to Barrière's enterprise by reporting the tent to the authorities as a fire hazard. Barrière responded by erecting a brick-and-mortar structure on the site. The new building, named the Chatham Garden Theatre, opened on 17 May 1824 and played through the normal season.\n\nThe theater was an ornate structure designed by architect George Conklin. It had no gallery, and it did not admit African Americans. The balcony was on the same level as the lobby and fronted the garden. The walls had slits and the doorways only blinds to facilitate airflow. Karl Bernhard, a visitor to New York in 1825–26, left this description:\n\nHowever, the theatre's location was difficult to find. It was only accessible by passing through private buildings on the west side of Chatham Street. The New-York Mirror offered these instructions:\n\nThe Chatham Garden Theatre offered popular actors at reasonable prices, and it did well. The playhouse provided the first real competition for the upper-class Park Theatre in its second season, which began on 9 May 1825. It remained a classy establishment for the next three seasons. During this time, it produced the first two American operas, The Sawmill in 1824 and The Forest Rose in 1825.\n\nLater management\nBarrière died on 21 February 1826. On 15 March, the Chatham Garden Theatre was sold at auction to Henry Wallack for $4,500. Wallack reopened it on 20 March for a four-month season. He then refurbished and redecorated the playhouse before reopening on 9 October 1826. However, Wallack went bankrupt, and he was forced to close the Chatham Garden Theatre in April 1827.\n\nLater managers changed the theatre's focus from upper-class drama and opera to fare that appealed to the lower classes. A man named Megary took over as lessee and managed a short season beginning 16 June 1827 and another beginning on 3 December. Kilner and Maywood followed him, with a season beginning 9 June 1828.\n\nIn 1829, James H. Hackett took over and renamed the building the American Opera House. He offered two seasons of primarily light, popular music from 20 May 1829 to 1 September 1829. George Barrett and C. Young took over from him on 24 December, but their tenure lasted less than two weeks. The Opera House became Blanchard's Amphi-theatre on 18 January 1830, which specialized in equestrian entertainment and light drama. S. Phillips followed as manager on 11 March 1831; he lasted until May when Charles R. Thorne took the role. Finally, Thomas S. Hamblin purchased the theatre in late June 1831. The 1831–2 season was its last.\n\nSince Barrière's death, the Chatham Garden had slipped to the low end of New York's  entertainment industry. It was known for fistfights among its patrons, drunken brawls, and openness to prostitution. Of New York's three big theatres (the Park and the Bowery being the other two), it had the roughest reputation. Brothels thrived on the same block. Frances Trollope described the playhouse in no uncertain terms:\n\nNevertheless, Mrs Trollope's description reveals that the theatre may not have been as raffish as its reputation made it sound. The presence of a nursing mother suggests that the theatre was lower-class, certainly, but also family-oriented.\n\nPresbyterian chapel\n\nIn the spring of 1832, Lewis Tappan and William Green rented the building. They offered it to the Presbyterian minister Charles Grandison Finney, a radical abolitionist who converted it into the Free Presbyterian Chatham Street Chapel. In October 1832, the chapel was the site of the  first national Sunday School convention in the United States.  Over the next ten years, at first here, then from 1835 to 1836 at the massive new Broadway Tabernacle,  Finney gave sermons each Sunday to crowds as large as 3000 and led revivals three times a week. The Sacred Music Society, a popular religious choir, rented the building for two nights a week in this period at a cost of $850 a year. Philip Hone described his reaction to a performance in 1835:\n\nIn its later years, the church became a hotel.  The building has since been demolished, and the land is now the site of a Metropolitan Correctional Center federal facility housing male and female pre-trial and holdover inmates, serving the Southern District of New York.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Bank, Rosemarie K.

{"id": "4106394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIf", "title": "IIf", "text": "In computing, IIf (an abbreviation for Immediate if) is a function in several editions of the Visual Basic programming language and ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML), and on spreadsheets that returns the second or third parameter based on the evaluation of the first parameter.  It is an example of a conditional expression, which is similar to a conditional statement.\n\nSyntax\nThe syntax of the IIf function is as follows:\n IIf(expr, truepart, falsepart)\n\nAll three parameters are required:\n expr is the expression that is to be evaluated.\n truepart defines what the IIf function returns if the evaluation of expr returns true.\n falsepart defines what the IIf function returns if the evaluation of expr returns false.\n\nMany languages have an operator to accomplish the same purpose, generally referred to as a conditional operator (or, less precisely, as a ternary operator); the best known is ?:, as used in C, C++, and related languages. Some of the problems with the IIf function, as discussed later, do not exist with a conditional operator, because the language is free to examine the type and delay evaluation of the operands, as opposed to simply passing them to a library function.\n\nExamples\nThese examples evaluate mathematical expressions and return one of two strings depending on the outcome.\n\n result = IIf(5 < 10, \"Yes it is\", \"No it isn't\")     ' Returns \"Yes it is\"\n\n result = IIf(2 + 2 = 5, \"Correct\", \"Wrong\")          ' Returns \"Wrong\"\n\nCriticisms\n\nEfficiency\n\nBecause IIf is a library function, it will always require the overhead of a function call, whereas a conditional operator will more likely produce inline code.\n\nFurthermore, the data type of its arguments is Variant. If the function is called with arguments of other types (variables or literals), there will be additional overhead to convert these to Variant. There may also be additional overhead to check the argument types and convert one of them if they do not have the same type.\n\nSide effects\n\nAnother issue with IIf arises because it is a library function: unlike the C-derived conditional operator, both truepart and the falsepart will be evaluated regardless of which one is actually returned. In the following code snippet:\n\nvalue = 10\nresult = IIf(value = 10, ''TrueFunction'', FalseFunction)\n\nalthough TrueFunction is the function intended to be called, IIf will call both TrueFunction and FalseFunction. Similarly,\n\na = 10\nb = 0\nresult = IIf(b <> 0, a / b, 0)\n\nWhile the intent may be to avoid a division by zero, whenever b is zero the error will actually happen. This is because the code in the snippet is executed as if by\n\na = 10\nb = 0\n_temp1 = b <> 0\n_temp2 = a / b ' Error if b = 0\n_temp3 = 0\nIf _temp1 Then\n    result = _temp2\nElse\n    result = _temp3\nEnd If\n\nThis issue makes the IIf() call less useful than the conditional operator. To solve this issue, Microsoft developers had considered converting IIf to an intrinsic function; had this happened, the compiler would have been able to perform type inference and short-circuiting by replacing the function call with inline code.\n\nAlternatives to IIf\nIn Visual Basic, IIf is not the sole way to evaluate and perform actions based on whether an expression is true or false.\n\nThe following example uses IIf:\n result = IIf(x = y, value1, value2)\n\nIt could also be written in the following way, using standard conditionals:\n\nIf x = y Then\n    result = value1\nElse\n    result = value2\nEnd If\n\nThe above example would also eliminate the problem of IIf evaluating both its truepart and falsepart parameters.\n\nVisual Basic 2008 (VB 9.0) introduced a true conditional operator, called simply \"If\", which also eliminates this problem. Its syntax is similar to the IIf function's syntax:\n\nresult = If(x = y, value1, value2)\n\nIIf in other programming languages\n$iif() is present in mIRC script, with similar syntax. \n\nalias testiif { \n  %testiif = 0\n  echo -a $iif(1,$testiif2,$testiif2) %testiif execution(s)\n  unset %testiif\n}\nalias testiif2 { inc %testiif | return testing $!iif: }\n\nCalling /testiif will print out \"testing $iif: 1 execution(s)\". mIRC's $iif acts more like C's ?: than IIf() in VB since it won't pre-evaluate both.\n\nIIF() is a function in dBase and xBase (1992 and older).\n\niif() is also a compiler magic function of Oxygene. It is not a real function and is at compile time unrolled to conditional statements.\n\nvar someString := iif(someInt > 35 , 'Large', 'Small');\n\nIn this example a new strong type string named \"someString\" is created (using Type inference) and the iif function will fill it depending on the outcome of the boolean expression.\n\nSQL Server 2012 and newer implements the IIF() function (Transact-SQL):\nDECLARE @a int = 45;\nDECLARE @b int = 40;\nSELECT IIF ( @a > @b, 'TRUE', 'FALSE' ) AS Result;\n\nIIf in C is the ?: conditional operator:\nprintf(\"number %d is%s even\", num, num % 2 ? \" not\" : \"\");\n\nIIf in Python:\nparity = \"odd\" if n % 2 else \"even\"\n\nIIf (either) in Red and Rebol:\n\nparity: either odd? n ['odd]['even]\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n MSDN Documentation for IIf\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio\nConditional constructs\nArticles with example Python (programming language) code\nArticles with example BASIC code\nBASIC programming language"}

He is a former head coach of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, a position he held from 2008 to 2014. He previously served as the defensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars between 2003 and 2007. During his tenure as the head coach of the Falcons, Smith became the franchise's winningest head coach by number of wins in addition to being the recipient of the 2008 NFL Coach of the Year Award by the Associated Press and was also voted NFL Coach of the Year Award by the Sporting News in 2008, 2010 and 2012.\n\nEarly years\nRaised in Daytona Beach, Florida, Smith played linebacker at Father Lopez Catholic High School, earning all-state honors. He played collegiately for East Tennessee State University between 1977 and 1981, and was chosen as defensive MVP twice. He briefly played professionally for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League, for the 1982 season, before retiring as a player.\n\nCoaching career\n\nCollege Coaching\n\nSmith decided to take up coaching after his playing days were over, starting in various assistant capacities with several Division I colleges before moving on to the NFL: San Diego State (1982–1985), Morehead State (1986) and Tennessee Tech (1987–1998).\n\nBaltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars\n\nHis first NFL job was as defensive assistant/defensive line coach for the Baltimore Ravens in 1999 under defensive line coach Rex Ryan for three seasons. In 2002, he was promoted to linebackers' coach for head coach Brian Billick, tutoring such future standouts as Ray Lewis, Peter Boulware, Jamie Sharper and Adalius Thomas, and in that capacity helped the 2000 Ravens win Super Bowl XXXV. On January 21, 2003, he was again promoted, moving on to be defensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars for incoming head coach Jack Del Rio.\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nIn 2008, Smith became head coach for the first time at any level, taking charge of the Atlanta Falcons and starting off his first season by installing rookie Matt Ryan as starting quarterback to open the season against the Detroit Lions. In his debut as an NFL head coach, his Falcons beat the Lions 34–21. Atlanta's 216 yards of total offense in the first quarter was the highest in over two decades, eclipsing their October 13, 1991 mark of 172 yards against San Francisco. His first loss, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, was mitigated by winning his first coach's challenge, on the spotting of the ball after a Roddy White reception in the third quarter, giving the Falcons a first down and keeping the drive alive. Stars like Michael Turner, Roddy White, Michael Jenkins and John Abraham helped him carry the Falcons to their first playoff berth since 2004, although they lost fairly narrowly to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs. He was named the 2008 AP Coach of the year and NFL Coach of the Year, beating out Miami Dolphins head coach Tony Sparano in the voting.\n\nIn his second season, Smith and the Falcons overcame a difficult schedule and several key injuries (to QB Ryan and RB Turner) to end up with a 9–7 finish and second place in the NFC South. While they failed to reach the playoffs, this marked the first time the team had ever had back-to-back winning seasons.\n\nIn 2010, he led the Falcons to a NFC-best season record of 13–3, earning the team's second NFC South title and fourth divisional championship overall before being beaten at home by the eventual Super Bowl XLV champions, the Green Bay Packers, 48–21 in the NFC Divisional Round.\n\nThe 2011 season ended with another winning record (10–6) and Smith's third playoff appearance (a first-round loss, by another eventual Super Bowl champion, the New York Giants).\n\nIn 2012 Smith led the Falcons to a league best 13–3 record and recorded his first win in the postseason as Falcons head coach, edging the Seattle Seahawks 30–28 in the 2012 NFC Divisional Playoffs. With the win, Atlanta also made their 3rd all-time appearance in the NFC Championship Game, and hosted the game for the first time in their history against the San Francisco 49ers. The Falcons were beaten 28–24 after taking the lead 10–0 in the 1st Quarter. Also in the 2012 season, Smith earned his 50th win by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles on October 28, passing Dan Reeves as the best-performing coach in Falcons history by number of wins.  Smith reached 50 wins in 71 games, which is good for 3rd-best since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970, surpassed only by Chuck Knox who earned his 50th win in 65 games and by George Seifert in 62 games.\n\nSmith was named Sporting News 2012 Coach of the Year for the 3rd time by a pool of 27 NFL coaches and executives.\n\nIn the 2013 season, the Falcons slumped to a 4–12 record, and Smith was eventually named the head coach of the North Team in the 2014 Senior Bowl.\n\nOn December 28, 2014, multiple media outlets reported that the Falcons had hired Korn Ferry, a reputed firm, to assist in finding potential candidates to replace Smith should he be fired.  Later that day, the Falcons lost to the Carolina Panthers 34–3.  The game determined the NFC South champion, despite both teams having a losing record. On December 29, 2014, Smith was fired, after two losing seasons in a row.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nOn January 15, 2016, Smith was named the defensive coordinator for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, under former assistant Dirk Koetter, who was named the Buccaneers' head coach that same day. On October 15, 2018, Smith was fired after leading Tampa Bay to the league's worst defense through the first six weeks of the season.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nHula Bowl\nIn January 2022, Smith coached Team Aina in the Hula Bowl, a college football postseason all-star game. He returned as head coach of the same squad in 2023.\n\nPersonal life\nSmith is the oldest of eight children. Mike and his wife, Julie, have one daughter, Logan.

{"id": "4106421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%20S.%20Wiener", "title": "Alexander S. Wiener", "text": "Alexander Solomon Wiener (March 16, 1907 – November 6, 1976), was an American biologist and physician, specializing in the fields of forensic medicine, serology, and immunogenetics.  His pioneer work led to discovery of the Rh factor in 1937, along with Dr. Karl Landsteiner, and subsequently to the development of exchange transfusion methods that saved the lives of countless infants with hemolytic disease of the newborn. He received a Lasker Award for his achievement in 1946.\n\nLife\nAlexander Solomon Wiener was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of George Wiener, an attorney who had emigrated from Russia in 1903, and Mollie (Zuckerman) Wiener. He attended Brooklyn public schools, graduating from Brooklyn Boys' High School at the age of 15. He was awarded scholarships to attend Cornell University where he continued his study of mathematics and even contributed mathematical problems to the American Mathematical Monthly. He majored in biology, however, receiving his A.B. in 1926. He then entered the Long Island College of Medicine where he was awarded an M.D. in 1930.\nHis kinship to Norbert Wiener is unclear.\n\nDuring his time in medical school Wiener did research work on blood groups at the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn and from 1930 to 1932 he interned there and kept up a lifelong affiliation with that institution as the head of the Division of Genetics and Biometrics (1933–1935) and as the head of the blood transfusion division until 1952. Since 1932 he had a medical practice and in 1935 he founded the Wiener Laboratories for clinical pathology and blood grouping. In 1938 he became a member of the Department of Forensic Medicine of New York University School of Medicine, rising to the rank of professor by 1968. Since the 1930s he co-operated with the office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York City.\n\nWiener was a good pianist and he also enjoyed tennis and golf. He kept up his lifelong interest in mathematics and physics by reading in these areas. In recognition of his contribution to forensic medicine he was awarded an honorary membership of the Mystery Writers of America.\n\nIn 1932 Wiener married Gertrude Rodman and they had two daughters, Jane and Barbara. Wiener died of leukemia in New York on 6 November 1976.\n\nImportant contributions in hematology\n\nBlood \"fingerprinting\"\nWiener began working with Landsteiner at the age of 23, shortly after beginning his work at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, where he remained for the rest of his life.  Much of their initial work revolved around the M Factor, which they discovered was actually five different, distinct blood factors.\n\nThis encouraged them in their quest to create a blood \"fingerprint,\" a unique blood profile that could be used in legal and criminal matters. Wiener pioneered much of the type of blood testing that has now, in the age of DNA, become commonplace. Along with his work in his Brooklyn lab, Wiener also did a considerable amount of work in a Manhattan lab where he concentrated on forensics, assisting the police in numerous investigations by analyzing the blood (or related fluids) of those involved.\n\nNumerous articles and chapters of books with real life crime stories were written about Dr. Wiener's work in criminology.  Along with his father, George Wiener, a lawyer. Wiener helped draft a new set of laws addressing the recent scientific advancements in blood identification.  He was a member of the American Medical Association legal committee that sponsored blood test laws in all states, and he was the co-author of its 1935 report. His work in the genetics of the blood factors also allowed him to be of assistance in many paternity cases.\n\nHe was eventually made an honorary member of the Mystery Writers of America for his work.\n\nRh factor\nWhen Wiener and Landsteiner discovered the Rh factor in 1937 (named after the Rhesus monkeys used as test subjects), they did not immediately realize its significance.  It was seen as yet another factor, not much different from the M, N, or P factors—useful for \"fingerprinting,\" but not having much more extended implications.  However, Wiener soon realized that the new blood factor they had discovered was associated with problems in blood transfusions.  Although the first time Rh positive blood is transfused into someone with Rh negative blood, it may not cause any harm, it does cause the creation of antibodies which make a second such transfusion very dangerous.  By the time he and Landsteiner published in 1940,  Wiener was able to demonstrate the role of Rh sensitization as a cause of intragroup hemolytic reactions, thus increasing the safety of blood transfusions.\n\nAlso, in conjunction with Philip Levine's separate work which helped identify the Rh factor as a major cause of erythroblastosis fetalis, or Rh disease, he was able to help solve a major cause of infant fatality.  In 1946, Dr. Wiener created the first medical procedure to combat the problem, which he called an exchange transfusion.  It consisted of a complete blood transfusion for the affected baby.  The method was further refined by Harry Wallerstein, a transfusionist.\n\nSince then, less extreme methods have been found to deal with erythroblastosis fetalis.  However, at the time, the procedure was able to save over 200,000 lives.\n\nNomenclature and genetics\nA lot of Wiener's later work involved examining the genetics of the Rh factor.  In the process, he became embroiled in controversy, as an alternative theory, the so-called CDE-nomenclature was proposed by Robert Russell Race and Ronald Fisher, hence also called Race-Fisher theory, which was somewhat simpler to understand.  Although Wiener's theories on the genetics of the Rh factor have recently proven to be closer to the actual DNA structure of the genes (though the current scientific understanding combines aspects of the two theories), there are still many who have adopted the CDE notations.\n\nWiener's theory is that Rh inheritance is controlled as follows:\nThere is one Rh locus at which occurs one Rh gene, but this gene has multiple alleles. \nFor example, one gene R1 produces one agglutinogen (antigen) Rh1 which is composed of three \"factors\": rh', Rh(o), and hr' '. The three factors are analogous to C, D, and e respectively in the CDE nomenclature. The d gene does not exist in Wiener's theory, and, in fact, has been proven not to exist at all.\n\nIn fact, it has recently been proven that there are two connected genes, one of which has multiple specificities, as Wiener theorized.  So although he was incorrect to theorize that there was only one gene involved, the principle that a single gene can have multiple alleles, a revolutionary idea at the time, has proven true.\n\nAwards\n 1946 Albert Lasker Award for clinical research awarded jointly with Karl Landsteiner and Philip Levine\n 1951 Passano Foundation Award\n\nPublications\n Rh-Hr Blood Types, New York 1954\n with Irving Bernard Wexler: Heredity of the Blood Groups, New York 1958\n with Karl Landsteiner: An agglutinable factor in human blood recognized by immune sera for rhesus blood.

{"id": "4106433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cootes%20Drive", "title": "Cootes Drive", "text": "Cootes Drive, formerly known as the Dundas Diversion, is a city street in Hamilton, Ontario. The route connects York Road and King Street in Dundas with Main Street (formerly Highway 2 and Highway 8) to the southeast, and is considered one of the first divided highways in Canada. Originally constructed as the Dundas Diversion, the route served to bypass several sharp turns along the nearby Highway8, as well as to demonstrate the new dual highway concept that would soon thereafter evolve into the 400-series highway network. Construction began in 1936, and the route opened on the weekend of September11, 1937.\n\nCootes Drive continued to be referred to as the Dundas Diversion by the Department of Highways (DHO), predecessor to the modern Ministry of Transportation of Ontario until 1947, though it occasionally appeared in internal documents as Highway8D and Highway6D in the early 1940s. By 1948, the route was publicly designated as Highway102, which it remained as until 1964 before being transferred to the townships of Ancaster and West Flamborough in 1964. It has since been known as Cootes Drive.\n\nRoute description \n\nCootes Drive connects Dundas with the Hamilton neighbourhoods of Ainslie Wood and Westdale, passing primarily through the swampland at the western head of Lake Ontario known as Cootes Paradise, for which the route is named. Cootes Paradise is named for Thomas Coote (nephew of Eyre Coote). Coote served as a lieutenant in the 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot from 1776–1781 and later as a captain of the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot, and spent his free time shooting ducks in the marsh that came to be named for him.\n\nThe route begins at the intersection of King Street and York Street / York Road in downtown Dundas, where it forms a thoroughfare with King Street. The route immediately widens from two to four lanes and briefly travels diagonally through the eastern edge of the town, partially along the former alignment of Baldwin Street. After passing Dundas Street (former Highway 99), it exits Dundas and becomes sandwiched between the Desjardins Canal to the north and Spencer Creek as well as the former Hamilton Street Railway—now the Spencer Creek Trail—to the south. A recreational trail also follows adjacent to the south side of the road east of Dundas Street.\n\nCootes Drive intersects Olympic Drive and passes under several overhead power lines that connect to the adjacent Dundas Transformer Station; one of these lines turns east and follows along the south side of the road. Now serving as the southwestern boundary of the Royal Botanical Gardens, the route begins a long gentle curve to the south, crossing Spencer Creek midway through the curve. As it approaches the end of the curve, the power lines cross to the east and ramps serve Westaway Road, which passes over the road. The east side of the route is now dominated by McMaster University, while the residential neighbourhood of Ainslie Wood flanks the west side. The recreation trail ends at Sanders Boulevard, which stops short of an intersection with Cootes Drive, but features a traffic signal for pedestrians to cross to the university. After a brief jog eastward, Cootes Drive ends at an intersection with Main Street West. Leland Street continues south of Main Street West as a residential street.\n\nHistory \nThe Dundas Diversion was one of the first divided dual-carriageway road built in Canada. As part of a plan to build \"dual highways\" across southern Ontario, Minister of Highways Thomas McQuesten had instructed his Deputy Minister, Robert Melville Smith, to research the Autobahns of Germany in 1934 and subsequently used this design to develop The Middle Road. McQuesten also began expanding short sections of Highway 2 in Windsor, Woodstock, Scarborough, and along what is now the Thousand Islands Parkway amongst other places. These sections were built in an effort to entice support amongst taxpayers for his larger plans.\nThe Dundas Diversion was another of these short new highways. It was first publicly announced by the Department of Highways (DHO), predecessor to the modern Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, in late June 1936, and construction began on July21. The majority of the grading was completed by November before construction was halted for the winter.\nA contract was let for the paving of the graded route in April 1937,\nand the new road—while not fully completed—was opened to traffic on the weekend of September11, 1937.\n\nThe DHO continued to refer to this route as the Dundas Diversion for several years,\nbefore designating it as Highway8D for the first time in the Annual Report for 1940.\nIt remained as Highway8D through 1942,\nbefore being labelled as Highway6D the following two years.\nIt returned to being labelled as the Dundas Diversion from 1944 to 1947, making it unclear if the route was ever signed with a number.\nHowever, by 1948, the Dundas Diversion was signed as Highway102.\nHighway102 remained in place until 1964, when responsibility and maintenance over the route was transferred to the townships of Ancaster and West Flamborough. The portion east of Spencer Creek was transferred to Ancaster on April1, while the portion to the west of the creek was transferred to West Flamborough on August14.\n\nBy 1969, the former highway was known as Cootes Drive.\nThe Highway102 designation was reused on a different highway near Thunder Bay by 1972.\nIn late October 2007, Hamilton City Council voted to assign the commemorative Veterans Memorial Parkway designation to Cootes Drive between East Street / Dundas Street and Main Street West.\n\nMajor intersections\n\nSee also \nList of streets in Hamilton, Ontario\n\nReferences \n\nRoads in Hamilton, Ontario\nLimited-access roads in Canada\nParkways in Ontario"}

Two separate classes were built in the UK, by two different railway companies. Both of these had their origins with an 0-8-0 tender design. Both classes were designed as powerful, but slow-speed, locomotives for heavy shunting. They did not require high speed or long range, so had no need for a leading truck or the greater coal capacity of a tender. Other than this though, they were quite distinct.\n\nThe first example was the Great Central Railway Class 8H of 1907. These were designed for hump shunting and so required high tractive effort, good adhesion and traction for starting from rest. Although developed from the 8A tender class, and having some interchangeable parts in their running gear, they also had three cylinders rather than two. The three cylinder tank locomotive was in fashion at this time, as a means of achieving good acceleration from rest, owing to their more even power delivery and the reduced risk of wheelslip. This three-cylindered pattern had begun with Holden's Decapod of 1902 and carried through into Worsdell and Raven's fast passenger tank locomotives of 4-6-2T and 4-4-4T layout for the North Eastern Railway in 1910 and 1913. Worsdell also designed a comparable heavy shunter of his own, the Class X, although this used the 4-8-0T layout with a leading bogie, rather than trailing.\n\nThe class was considered a success, although highly specialised, and developments were rebuilt and built new by the LNER. The rebuilt locomotive trialled a new outside-framed bogie, fitted with a booster engine, the LNER being one of the few UK railways to favour these. Two further locomotives were also built by the LNER. Six were built in total.\n\nThe second example was LNWR 380 Class. These were a simple stretched version of the inside-cylindered 0-8-2T 1185 Class, which had been derived from the LNWR's numerous 0-8-0 freight locomotives, with a larger coal bunker. The class was intended for both shunting, banking and as mineral engines for the heavy coal or iron train use in the South Wales coalfield. The enlarged bunker made them more suitable for these longer workings. Thirty were built.\n\nReferences \n\n \n8,0-8-4"}

{"id": "4106458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philopatris", "title": "Philopatris", "text": "The Philopatris () is a work of Byzantine literature, a dialogue formerly attributed to Lucian, but now generally admitted to be spurious. Its date and purpose have long formed the subject of discussion.\n\nThe story\nThe scene is laid at Constantinople. A certain Trephon, who has been converted to Christianity by a bald, long-nosed Galilaean, who was carried up through the air into the third heaven (an evident allusion to St. Paul) and meets a friend, Critias, who is in a state of great excitement.\n\nTrephon asks the reason for Critias' excitement, and the invocation of Zeus by Critias leads to a discussion on paganism and Christianity, in which all the gods proposed by Critias are rejected by Trephon, who finally suggests that Critias should swear by the Trinity (the Greek subtitle, , refers to this \"instruction\" of Critias in matters relating to Christianity).\n\nCritias goes on to relate how he had been introduced to a gathering of pessimists, who predicted all kinds of disturbances in the empire and defeat at the hands of its enemies. In the meantime a third person appears on the scene, with the news that the imperial armies have obtained a glorious victory. The hope is expressed that Babel (Baghdad, the chief city of the caliphs) may soon be destroyed, Egypt subdued (that is, reconquered from the Arabs), and the attacks of the \"Scythians\" (Russians or Bulgarians) repulsed.\n\nThe dialogue concludes with thanks to the unknown god of Athens that they have been permitted to be the subjects of such an emperor and the inhabitants of such an empire.\n\nControversy\nThe Philopatris was for a long time regarded as an attack upon Christianity, and assigned to the time of Julian the Apostate (emperor 361-363). Chronological indications (e.g., the allusion to a massacre of women in Crete) led Niebuhr to ascribe it to the reign of Nicephorus Phocas (963-969), and this view is now generally supported.\n\nThere being at that time no pagans in Constantinople, the pessimists referred to must be Christians; either monks, especially the intimate friends of the patriarch of Constantinople, who, aggrieved at the measures taken by Phocas in regard to the property of the Church, were ready to welcome the defeat of the imperial arms and the ruin of the empire; or harmless visionaries, who claimed to predict the future by fasting, prayer and vigil.\n\nIn any case, the author, whether he was a sophist commissioned by Phocas to attack the monks, or some professor who hoped to profit by singing the imperial praises, represents the views of the patriotic (as the title shows) as opposed to the unpatriotic party.\n\nAccording to another view, which assigns the dialogue to the time of Heraclius (610-641), the author was a Christian fanatic, whose object was to make known the existence of a conventicle of belated pagans, the enemies alike of the Christian faith and the empire; it is doubtful, however, whether such a pagan community, sufficiently numerous to be of importance, actually existed at that date. The object of the first and longer portion of the dialogue was to combat the humanism of the period, which threatened a revival of polytheism as a rival of Christianity.\n\nIn 1982,  The Date and Purpose of the Philopatris, by Barry Baldwin was published in Later Greek Literature, Volume 27, with arguments that effectively overturned the Byzantine dating. Baldwin considered the date alternatives, including the possibility that \"the Philopatris belonged to the reign of Julian\", while noting that \"the Philopatris is curiously hard to pin down.\"\n\nEditions and translations\n Editions by J.M.

The second, and perhaps the better known, was the single Class U1 of the London & North Eastern Railway (LNER), built in 1925.\n\nUse\n\nBurma\nApart from their first single class GA.I locomotive of 1924, the  Burma Railways acquired another locomotive from Beyer, Peacock & Company in 1927, classifying it GA.II. In that same year, another four of class GA.III were placed in service, also from Beyer, Peacock. In 1929, Krupp of Essen in Germany delivered eight more, designated Class GA.IV.\n\nIndia\nThe  Bengal Nagpur Railway in India used two of the class HSG, built by Beyer, Peacock & Company in 1925.\n\nTen  examples were purchased by the British War Department in 1943 and used on the Bengal Assam Railway in India as their Class MWGX.\n\nMauritius\n\nThe Mauritius Railway owned three   Garratts, also built by Beyer, Peacock & Company in 1927.\n\nTurkey\nThe Ottoman Railways in Turkey acquired a single   Garratt from Beyer, Peacock & Company in 1927.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) owned a single Class U1 Garratt, built by Beyer, Peacock & Company in 1925. It was designed by Nigel Gresley for banking coal trains over the Worsborough Bank, a steeply graded line in South Yorkshire and part of the Woodhead line. The Class U1 was both the longest and the most powerful steam locomotive ever to run in the United Kingdom.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n1D+D1 locomotives\n8,2-8-0"}
{"id": "4106478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland%20Route%2017", "title": "Maryland Route 17", "text": "Maryland Route 17 (MD 17) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  The state highway begins at the Virginia state line at the Potomac River in Brunswick, where the highway continues south as Virginia State Route 287 (SR 287).  MD 17 runs  north from the Brunswick Bridge to the Frederick–Washington county line near Wolfsville.  The state highway serves as the main north–south highway of the Middletown Valley of western Frederick County.  MD 17 connects Brunswick and Wolfsville with Rosemont, Burkittsville, Middletown, and Myersville.  The state highway also connects those communities with the valley's main east–west highways, which include U.S. Route 340 (US 340), US 40 Alternate, Interstate 70 (I-70), and US 40.\n\nWhat is now MD 17 was originally designated MD 33.  The first sections of the state highway were constructed in Brunswick and Rosemont in 1916.  MD 33 was mostly constructed south of Myersville in the early 1920s; the last pieces of the Brunswick–Myersville highway were filled in by 1927.  MD 33 was completed from Myersville to Wolfsville in the early 1930s.  MD 33 swapped numbers with the original MD 17, a highway on the Eastern Shore, in 1940.  The portion of MD 17 north of Wolfsville was brought into the state highway system in 1956, the same year the Myersville–Middletown Road was transferred to county control.  The state highway north of Myersville was designated MD 153.  In the mid 1980s, MD 17 was extended north from Middletown, assuming all of MD 153 to its present northern terminus.  The modern Brunswick Bridge was constructed in the early 1950s, replacing a bridge constructed in the early 1890s at the same site.\n\nRoute description\n\nMD 17 begins at the Virginia state line at the Potomac River in the city of Brunswick.  The roadway continues into Loudoun County, Virginia, as SR 287 (Berlin Pike), which heads south toward Lovettsville.  MD 17 crosses the river on the Brunswick Bridge, a two-lane steel girder bridge that also passes over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, CSX's Metropolitan Subdivision railroad line, Walnut Street, Virginia Avenue, and Potomac Street.  The bridge's northern end lands just south of a roundabout that connects MD 17 with Petersville Road, Maryland Avenue, and both directions of B Street.  Petersville Road, the old alignment of MD 17, heads south into the Brunswick Historic District and becomes Maple Avenue, which provides access to Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park and the historic Brunswick train station, which is served by MARC's Brunswick Line.\n\nMD 17 heads north from the Brunswick Roundabout as two-lane undivided Petersville Road, which climbs out of the narrow Potomac River valley.  At the top of the hill, the state highway leaves the city of Brunswick and enters the village of Rosemont, where the highway intersects MD 79 and MD 464 (Souder Road).  Petersville Road continues north as MD 79 while MD 17 turns northwest onto Burkittsville Road.  The state highway leaves the village of Rosemont, passes through a roundabout intersection with Volunteer Drive and intersects the western end of Rosemont Drive through a roundabout, the old alignment of MD 17 that is unsigned MD 871G. That roundabout also intersects the main entrance to the Brunswick Crossing development started in the early 2000s. MD 17 continues on to intersect MD 180 (Jefferson Pike) at a roundabout before crossing over US 340 (Jefferson National Pike) at a diamond interchange.  At the end of the overpass, MD 17 passes through another roundabout which serves to distribute traffic to and from the on and off ramps of westbound US 340. North of US 340, the state highway runs mostly straight through farmland parallel to the upper reaches of Little Catoctin Creek intersecting with Brentland Rd. and then Lee's Lane following which the highway passes through a pair of right-angle curves and parallels South Mountain to the hamlet of Coatsville.\n\nMD 17 curves to the northeast and enters the town of Burkittsville, where the highway's name becomes Potomac Street.  Within the Burkittsville Historic District, the state highway intersects Main Street, which heads west to Crampton's Gap, a low point in South Mountain that contains Gathland State Park.  MD 17 leaves Burkittsville and crosses Broad Run near the hamlet of Arnoldtown, then meets the northern end of MD 383 (Broad Run Road) and the west end of Bennies Hill Road, which leads to the Bennies Hill Road Bridge and historic Shafer's Mill.  The state highway continues across Middle Creek and parallels Catoctin Creek before crossing the latter stream on a through truss bridge.  MD 17 enters the town of Middletown just south of its intersection with Jefferson Street and Old Middletown Road.  The state highway passes through town as Church Street and meets US 40 Alternate (Main Street) in the center of the Middletown Historic District.\n\nMD 17 leaves Middletown as Myersville Middletown Road, which heads northeast then curves northwest to parallel I-70 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway).  The two highways cross Little Catoctin Creek—this creek being a tributary of Catoctin Creek rather than the Potomac River-feeding creek near Brunswick—near the state highway's intersection with Harmony Road, then MD 17 veers west away from the Interstate.  The state highway intersects Old Hagerstown Road at an oblique angle and crosses Catoctin Creek again before veering north and reaching Ventrie Court, which heads east to provide access to a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses. The road temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway for its diamond interchange with I-70 at the town limit of Myersville.  After reducing to two lanes, MD 17 continues as Main Street toward the center of town, where the state highway turns east onto Wolfsville Road.  The state highway crosses Catoctin Creek just north of its confluence with Middle Creek and intersects US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) at the Myersville town limits.\n\nMD 17 heads north into a mountainous area with a mix of farmland and forest at the northern end of the Middletown Valley.  The state highway parallels Middle Creek, which it crosses twice, the second time at the hamlet of Ellerton, where the highway intersects Harmony Road, crosses the creek, then immediately turns east to remain on Wolfsville Road at its intersection with Harp Hill Road.  Harp Hill Road is a straighter but much steeper alternate route between Ellerton and Wolfsville compared to MD 17, which parallels Middle Creek and crosses the creek thrice as it winds through the communities of Crossnickel and Middlepoint and passes the historic Peter of P. Grossnickel Farm.  The state highway meets the northern end of Harp Mill Road and intersects Pleasant Walk Road and Stottlemeyer Road in Wolfsville.  MD 17 leaves Middle Creek and ascends South Mountain to its northern terminus at its intersection with Garfield Road and Loy Wolfe Road at the Frederick–Washington county line.  Wolfsville Road continues north as a county highway that descends South Mountain to MD 77 (Foxville Road) in Smithsburg on the eastern edge of the Hagerstown Valley.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first two sections of MD 17 to be constructed were Petersville Road from downtown Brunswick to what is now Rosemont Drive in Rosemont and Burkittsville Road from what is now MD 180 to Coatsville, which were completed as  wide macadam roads in 1916.  By 1921, sections of concrete road were completed from the National Pike in Middletown north to Valley View Road and from Myersville south to Catoctin Creek.  Another section of the highway was planned to follow the alignment of Old Hagerstown Road south from the Myersville segment to the National Pike west of Middletown.  By 1923, the gap between Middletown and Myersville was completed in concrete following the present alignment instead of Old Hagerstown Road.  Other segments completed that year included a macadam stretch from Coatsville to Burkittsville and a concrete road from Arnoldtown to the National Pike in Middletown.\n\nIn 1927, what is now MD 17 became one of the original state-numbered highways when it was marked as MD 33.  By that year, the gap between Burkittsville and Arnoldtown, Main Street in Myersville, and Wolfsville Road from Ellerton to Grossnickel had been paved with concrete.  In addition, a macadam road was constructed from Main Street in Myersville to the first crossing of Middle Creek north of the town.  The gap between that crossing of Middle Creek and Ellerton was filled by a concrete road in 1928.  Wolfsville Road from Grossnickel to Middlepoint was started in 1930.  That segment and the portion from Middlepoint to Wolfsville were completed in 1933.  MD 33's through truss bridge over Catoctin Creek between Burkittsville and Middletown was replaced with the modern through truss bridge on a new alignment in 1934.  All of MD 33 between Brunswick and Wolfsville was redesignated MD 17 in 1940, swapping numbers with modern MD 33 in Talbot County.\n\nThe portion of Wolfsville Road from Wolfsville north to the Washington County line was brought into the state highway system in 1956.  That same year, the portion of MD 17 between US 40 Alternate in Middletown and US 40 in Myersville was transferred to county maintenance.  MD 17 north of Myersville was renumbered MD 153.  MD 17 was placed on its present alignment in Rosemont from MD 79 to Rosemont Drive in 1968; MD 79 was extended south to the new four-way intersection with MD 17 and MD 464 and the old alignment of MD 17 along Rosemont Drive became MD 871G.  MD 153 was extended south of US 40 through Myersville to the I-70 interchange in 1979.  MD 17 achieved its present course in 1985 when the highway between Middletown and I-70 was returned to the state highway system; MD 17 was extended along what had been MD 153 to the Washington County line.  MD 17's roundabouts at the northern end of the Brunswick Bridge and at the MD 180 intersection were installed in 1999 and 2000, respectively.\n\nThe first ferry at the German Crossing of the Potomac River, named for the German settlement at Lovettsville, began at the site of Brunswick in 1731.  The first fixed crossing of the river was a covered bridge constructed between 1854 and 1857 by the Loudoun and Berlin Bridge Company; this bridge was burned by Confederate forces in June 1861.  In 1893, the Loudoun Berlin Bridge Company constructed an iron through truss bridge across the river on the abutments of the covered bridge.  Both the covered bridge and the iron bridge were located in line with Virginia Avenue, immediately to the east of the modern bridge.  Later, the access road to the bridge would follow Maple Avenue south from Petersville Road, cross the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, turn west onto what is now the access road for the C&O Canal Historical Park, then turn south to cross the river.  Construction on the modern Brunswick Bridge began in 1952 with preliminary engineering work and construction of the bridge's substructure and superstructure, which were completed in 1953.  Work on the bridge's deck and the Maryland approaches began in 1953 and continued through 1954.  The Brunswick Bridge was dedicated July 30, 1955.\n\nJunction list\n\nAuxiliary route\nMD 17A is the designation for Petersville Road, a  section of old alignment of MD 17 immediately northeast of the Brunswick Roundabout.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMDRoads: MD 17\n\n017\nMaryland Route 017"}

He was one of eight children to Samuel Harris Tatham Armitage, a Yorkshire doctor, and Alice (Lees) Armitage.\n\nIn 1878 Armitage enlisted as a cadet aboard the Royal Navy's training ship, , which was moored at the time in the River Thames near Greenhithe. At the conclusion of basic training he attempted to resign from the Navy and seek a position with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), but was prevented from doing so by his father. Instead, Armitage was signed on as an apprentice aboard the former Indian Navy frigate Punjaub, now owned by the East India Company. He sailed with Punjaub to Calcutta, where he transferred to another Company vessel, the Lucknow, as Third Mate.\n\nAfter seven years as a Company sailor, Armitage again sought parental consent to join P&O. Approval was received and in 1886 Armitage was appointed Fifth Officer aboard the P&O passenger ship Bokhara.\n\nPolar exploration\nBetween 1894 and 1897, he was second-in-command, of the Jackson–Harmsworth expedition to Franz Josef Land, and was involved in the 1895 rescue of explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his men.\n\nArmitage was then Robert Falcon Scott's navigator and second-in-command on the Discovery Expedition to Antarctica. The other members were Ernest Shackleton, George Mulock, Edward Adrian Wilson, Charles Royds, Frank Wild, Koettlitz, Skelton, Heald, Barne, Plumley, Quartley, Weller, Hare, Allen, Evans, Ferrar, Hodgson, Louis Bernacchi, Vince. On this expedition, he became the first person to walk on the polar plateau.\n\nArmitage got on very well with Scott during the preparations for the voyage and his RNR rank of lieutenant ensured that he was made second in command of the Discovery expedition. However, he later fell out with Scott and claimed that he and Markham failed to honour a number of promises they had made and on his return to Britain Armitage was paid off by the expedition and it took him nearly nine months to find an appointment with P & O.\n\nPost Antarctic\n\nOn his return to the UK he filled in his time by writing \"Two Years in the Antarctic\" (Edward Arnold, 1905). A row followed with Scott's publishers because Scott's \"Discovery Expedition\" didn't come out until after Armitage's book. However, according to Armitage, he was at sea when this happened and he and Scott later met up for lunch \"and all was sunshine.\" They never met again.\n\nEventually he was given his own command, the Royal Mail Steamer \"Isis\", carrying mails between Brindisi and Port Said. This was the story of his life until retirement, carrying passengers and mails on \"little ferry boats\" across the Mediterranean and later, in command of the \"Salsette\" between Bombay and Aden, living for many years away from England with his family in Brindisi and Malta. Toward the end of the First World War the \"Salsette\" was torpedoed in the English Channel with a loss of 14 crew. Armitage was then given command of the \"Karmala\" which was used to transporting cargo and U.S. and Canadian troops across the Atlantic and, later, for repatriating Australian soldiers.\n\nHis last command was the 11,000 ton mail steamer the \"Mantua\" on the Bombay to China run. After over 40 years at sea he was appointed Commodore of P & O and, by the company rules, required to retire at the age of 60 years, just one year later.  In 1928 he published \"Cadet To Commodore\" (Cassell & Co 1928) – an autobiography with only a few passing references to the Scott Expedition.\n\nArmitage was married with a single daughter who married a naval lieutenant.   His wife died, possibly in Malta, before World War I after a period of ill-health.  He died in Surrey on 31 October 1943 aged 79.\n\nArmitage's diaries of his time in the Antarctic were sold at auction for £36,000 in 2004 in two lots to a single buyer.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links \n\n1864 births\n1943 deaths\nExplorers of Antarctica\nPeople from Stirling (council area)\nRecipients of the Polar Medal\nRoyal Navy officers\nScottish explorers\nScottish sailors"}

He is considered the Latin American poet with the broadest Nordic influence, from the Finnish poets, Edith Södergran, Elmer Diktonius, Paavo Haavikko, Pentti Saarikoski and the Swedes Gunnar Ekelöf, Tomas Tranströmer and Lars Gustafsson.\n\nLife\nBadilla Castillo graduated in journalism from the University of Chile in 1972. He graduated also in Methodology of Social Anthropology, from Stockholm University. He worked for nearly 13 years at The Swedish Radio Broadcasting Co, as culture journalist, a concern that would lead later, to his work as a translator of Swedish and Scandinavian poetry, British and American poetry.\n\nHis father was a sailor from whom he got his nomadic motivation. Badilla Castillo travelled throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East during the 20 years he spent in Scandinavia. He settled for a while also in Romania in 1975, interested in ancient Wallachian and Transylvanian mythology. Badilla worked as a journalist and teacher when he returned to Chile in 1993.\n\nA research on global celebrities done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, through its Pantheon   project, released in April 2014, shows that the poet Sergio Badilla Castillo occupies 12th position among the most notorious public figures of Chile in the world community. The investigation took into account 11,338 people born between 4000 BC until 2010 D.C.  Castillo also appears in the fourth positions amid the most famous Chilean writers of all times.\n\nWork\n\nIn 1973 Badilla's first book of poetry, Amid the Cement and the Grass, was published in Valparaiso. Later, in 1980 he published his second book, Lower from my Branch, a collection of short stories, in Borås, Sweden, which received very good critical reviews.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1987 he published three of his Scandinavian influenced books: The Dwelling of the Sign, Oniric Song and Reverberations of Aquatic Stones. As well being a productive poet during this period he was also a respected translator of Swedish, Finnish, English, French and some Latin poetry. Badilla's initial topics were often tied to mythological or fabled subjects, while many of the poems featured legends. In Sweden, his poems were included in the first anthology of Chilean Poetry published by Bonnier in 1991.\n\nHis return from exile to Chile in 1993 marked a change for Badilla Castillo, in that he started to write in a much more autobiographical and manner. In his book Nordic Saga he changed his language completely. It was a period of awkward and challenging experimentation, with many legendary subjects derived from the mythological Viking’s Sagas. Badilla Castillo established contact with Rudy Rucker’s transrealism.\n\nIn Badilla Castillo's later volumes, such as The Fearful Gaze of the Bastard (2003), and  Transreal Poems and Some Gospels (2005)), he confronts reality, creating an almost illusory world, where words, time and dimensional changes play a cardinal role in the lyrical frame. His latest poetry is solidly imaginary, using in many respects time dislocations and immediate perceptions of a certain described reality, and filled with admiration for the ordinary world. He now lives in Santiago, and one catches a glimpse of the effect of this South Pacific landscape everywhere in his latest poems, though the environment remains symbolic and individual.\n\nBibliography\nLower from my Branch Invandrarförlaget. 1980.

The producers, creator Fred Goss (who also is the star of the show), Lorne Michaels (who was a co-creator of Saturday Night Live), and Nick Holly, flavored the show with a mixed atmosphere of improvisational and scripted humor. The show premiered on March 7, 2006, on ABC. The show is produced by Broadway Video (which also produces Saturday Night Live) and NBC Universal Television. It was canceled in late April 2006 after 10 episodes aired, leaving one unaired episode.\n\nThe whole series was aired on the Seven Network in Australia, including the final previously unaired episode, ending on August 6, 2007. Coincidentally, the Seven Network also screened the earlier Australian soap opera of the same name. In December 2010, ITV1 started showing the series in the United Kingdom for the first time, over four years since its American showing.  The show has also been aired on TV3 in Ireland.\n\nImprovisational aspect\nSons & Daughters has been dubbed a \"unique hybrid comedy\"; the show followed the format used in Curb Your Enthusiasm, using a partly scripted, partly improvisational comedy dialogue. In an interview with co-creator Nick Holly from the Associated Press, he explained that the actors were presented not with a traditional script, but with a \"short story\" that \"occasionally includes a line or two of dialogue, but is normally just this novelization.\"\n\nUnlike the traditional sitcom, Sons & Daughters was not filmed with a live studio audience and did not use a laugh track for the show.\n\nPlot synopsis\nCameron Walker's (Goss) world revolves around him and his extended family living in Hamilton, Ohio, which includes wife Liz (Vigman), his son Ezra (Matthews), his daughter Marni (Jourdain) and his son Henry (Einhorn) who Cameron didn't know existed, his mother and stepfather, Colleen and Wendal Halbert (Wallace-Stone, Gail), and his other plethora of brothers and sisters. He is considered the only sane person in his family and tries to fix any problem that arises within the family.\n\nCameron's sister and brother-in-law Sharon (Quinn) and Don Fenton (Lambert) seem to create more problems for him rather than themselves. The couple are almost always in deep denial about their personal issues, such as not having sex for several years.\n\nJenna (Walsh), Sharon and Cameron's half-sister, is a single mother of one who is continuously attracted to the \"bad boy\" personality, such as \"Whitey\" (Pitts), and steers away from the \"nice guy\" types, like Wylie (Harrington).\n\nTheir parents, Colleen and Wendal, love their family but have profound complications within their own relationship. Cameron constantly tries to help them solve their issues, but it doesn't always work out the way he expects.\n\nEpisodes\nBelow is the entire list of episodes from the series including a brief description.\n\nCancellation\nRunning against Fox Network's American Idol timeslot it did not receive the ratings that would merit a second season pickup, however it had been rumored that ABC executives liked the show. It also had a devoted fanbase, and on April 17, 2006, a fan started an online petition to bring the show back, which Fred Goss mentioned on his blog. It failed, and it was canceled late April, 2006.

{"id": "4106535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy%20Terror%20%28graphic%20novel%29", "title": "Holy Terror (graphic novel)", "text": "Holy Terror is a 2011 graphic novel by Frank Miller which follows a costumed vigilante named The Fixer as he battles Islamic terrorists after an attack on Empire City. The graphic novel was originally proposed as a Batman story for DC Comics, titled Holy Terror, Batman!, but was reworked along the way to feature a character of Miller's creation instead, and published by another company.\n\nDevelopment\nAs originally announced the plot revolved around Batman defending Gotham City from an attack by the Islamist terrorist group Al-Qaeda. According to Miller, the comic would have been a \"piece of propaganda\" in which Batman \"kicks Al-Qaeda's ass.\"\n\nMiller announced the graphic novel during a panel at the WonderCon comic book convention held in San Francisco in 2006. He summarized the work as \"not to put too fine a point on it, a piece of propaganda... Superman punched out Hitler. So did Captain America. That's one of the things they're there for.\"\n\nThe title of the graphic novel is a reference to the War on Terror as well as the catchphrase (\"Holy [something], Batman!\") used by Burt Ward (Robin) in the 1960s Batman television series.\n\nLater that year, on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks, NPR aired a brief memorial commentary by Miller, which provided insight into his inspiration for this project:\n\nIn a May 2007 interview, Miller relayed that he was still at work on the graphic novel, which he said was \"bound to offend just about everybody\". Miller also said he was about 100 pages into it with 50 remaining. The following year Miller said the series, until then being billed as Holy War, Batman, would no longer feature Batman. \"As I worked on it, it became something that was no longer Batman,\" he clarified. \"It's somewhere past that and I decided it's going to be part of a new series that I'm starting.\"\n\nIn 2010, Miller said he was no longer working on that project, clarifying that Holy Terror was in progress but without Batman. He later said it would feature a new character called The Fixer and not be published by DC. \"It's no longer a DC book,\" he explained. \"I decided partway through it that it was not a Batman story. The hero is much closer to Dirty Harry than Batman. It's a new hero that I've made up that fights Al Qaeda.\"\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con International 2011, Miller further explained the reason to drop Batman and use The Fixer as the protagonist, saying \"This character is much more well adjusted in committing terrible acts of violence on very evil people.\" Talking about the controversy the graphic novel might generate, he said he hoped the book accomplished its purpose in angering people.\n\nCriticism\nHoly Terror was controversial upon release; many comic book writers and reviewers argued that the novel's depiction of Muslims was Islamophobic. David Brothers of ComicsAlliance, in a review of the book, felt that Miller's writing \"[simplifies] matters to an almost absurd level... the enemy in Holy Terror is not so much the terrorist organization, Al-Qaeda, but the religion of Islam.\" Similarly, Cyriaque Lamar of Io9 called the portrayal of terrorists \"cartoonish... [gutting] Holy Terror of any emotional resonance.\" Spencer Ackerman of Wired wrote that the book was \"one of the most appalling, offensive and vindictive comics of all time... Miller's Holy Terror is a screed against Islam, completely uninterested in any nuance or empathy toward 1.2 billion people he conflates with a few murderous conspiracy theorists.\"\n\nIn August 2006, fellow Batman writer Grant Morrison criticized the novel's concept, saying:\n\nMiller responded generally to these criticisms on his blog, again referring to the book as intentional propaganda \"without apology\" and saying, \"I'm too old to serve my country in any other way. Otherwise, I'd gladly be pulling the trigger myself.\" However, in 2018, Miller expressed regret for writing Holy Terror: \"When I look at Holy Terror, which I really don't do all that often, I can really feel the anger ripple out of the pages... I don’t want to wipe out chapters of my own biography. But I'm not capable of that book again.\"\n\nSee also \n Batman: Holy Terror, an Elseworlds one-shot published by DC Comics in 1991\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Legendary Confirms Frank Miller's \"Holy Terror\", June 28, 2011\n\nSuperhero graphic novels\n2011 graphic novels\nAmerican graphic novels\nComics by Frank Miller (comics)\nCharacters created by Frank Miller (comics)\nIslamophobia in the United States\nReligious controversies in comics\nIslamophobic publications\nPropaganda books and pamphlets"}

It served to launch and oversee urban development projects related to business, industry, and housing. It was also tasked with developing urban infrastructure. After undergoing a couple of status changes, it now exists as UDA Holdings Berhad, a publicly listed company.\n\nHistory\nUrban Development Authority of Malaysia (UDA) was established on 12 November 1971 under the Ministry of Public Enterprise. In 1996, it was incorporated and changed its full name to UDA Holdings Sendirian Berhad (UDA Holdings Private Limited). Later in 1999, it changed its status to a public limited company and changed its name to UDA Holdings Berhad. It was subsequently publicly listed on the Main Board of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE).\n\nReal estate and property\n\nDevelopment\nUDA develops and reappropriates urban structures as it sees fit. Although this is mainly confined to redeveloping \"dilapidated buildings\", UDA is also responsible for conservation of historic urban buildings. Several new towns have been developed by UDA, including the Bandar Tun Hussein Onn in Cheras; Bandar UDA Utama in Pulai; Bandar Pauh Jaya in Permatang Pauh; Tanjung Tokong in Penang; Bandar Baru UDA in Johor Bahru; Pusat Bandar Tampoi in Johor Bahru; and Skudai Kanan in Johor Bahru. The development projects of UDA are implemented by its subsidiaries, PNS Development, UDA-Murni Development, UDAPEC, SBBU, and PERUDA Development.\n\nA joint venture development between UDA, EPF and EcoWorld was announced in 2016 to develop the Bukit Bintang City Centre (BBCC), a fully integrated development located at the former site of Pudu Jail, with the project 40% owned by UDA, 40% owned by Eco World Development Group Berhad and 20% owned by EPF.\n\nMaintenance\nProperties belonging to or managed by UDA are maintained by its subsidiary companies. These properties include shopping complexes and apartment buildings. UBSB is the subsidiary that handles rental collection, carpark management, building maintenance, security, and other assorted services. City Guards is the subsidiary handling most of the security work, with 212 security personnel and 10 branches guarding 22 premises in the states of Selangor, Terengganu, Perak, Johor and Negri Sembilan, as well as the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur. Other subsidiaries dealing with maintenance are Daya Urus and Pertama Buildings Management.\n\nTourism and retailing\nUDA has recently expanded into the hospitality industry, operating a hotel and three resorts in Kuala Lumpur, Port Dickson, Kuala Terengganu, and Seberang Prai. These lodgings are run by subsidiaries of UDA as well.\n\nUDA has established a chain of retail outlets through a joint venture subsidiary, UDA Ocean. UDA has also ventured into franchising, and has a fashion line named \"Bonia\".\n\nBusiness performance\nAs of February 2006, the most recent full fiscal year for which statistics are available is 2004. In 2004, after-tax profit for UDA was RM17,665,000.

{"id": "4106560", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging%20infectious%20disease", "title": "Emerging infectious disease", "text": "An emerging infectious disease (EID) is an infectious disease whose incidence has increased recently (in the past 20 years), and could increase in the near future. The minority that are capable of developing efficient transmission between humans can become major public and global concerns as potential causes of epidemics or pandemics. Their many impacts can be economic and societal, as well as clinical. EIDs have been increasing steadily since at least 1940. \n\nFor every decade since 1940, there has been a consistent increase in the number of EID events from wildlife-related zoonosis. Human activity is the primary driver of this increase, with loss of biodiversity a leading mechanism.\n\nEmerging infections account for at least 12% of all human pathogens. EIDs can be caused by newly identified microbes, including novel species or strains of virus (e.g. novel coronaviruses, ebolaviruses, HIV). Some EIDs evolve from a known pathogen, as occurs with new strains of influenza. EIDs may also result from spread of an existing disease to a new population in a different geographic region, as occurs with West Nile fever outbreaks. Some known diseases can also emerge in areas undergoing ecologic transformation (as in the case of Lyme disease). Others can experience a resurgence as a re-emerging infectious disease, like  tuberculosis (following drug resistance) or measles. Nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are emerging in hospitals, and are extremely problematic in that they are resistant to many antibiotics. Of growing concern are adverse synergistic interactions between emerging diseases and other infectious and non-infectious conditions leading to the development of novel syndemics.\n\nMany EID are zoonotic, deriving from pathogens present in animals, with only occasional cross-species transmission into human populations. For instance, most emergent viruses are zoonotic (whereas other novel viruses may have been circulating in the species without being recognized, as occurred with hepatitis C).\n\nHistory of the concept of emerging infectious diseases \nThe French doctor Charles Anglada (1809–1878) wrote a book in 1869 on extinct and new diseases.  He did not distinguish infectious diseases from others (he uses the terms reactive and affective diseases, to mean diseases with an external or internal cause, more or less meaning diseases with or without an observable external cause). He writes in the introduction:Charles Nicolle, laureate of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine elaborated the concept of emergence of diseases in his 1930 book Naissance, vie et mort des maladies infectieuses (Birth, Life and Death of Infectious Diseases), and later in Destin des maladies infectieuses (Fate of Infectious Diseases) published in 1933 which served as lecture notes for his teaching of a second year course at the Collège de France. In the introduction of the book he sets out the program of the lectures:The term emerging disease has been in use in scientific publications since the beginning of the 1960s at least and is used in the modern sense by David Sencer in his 1971 article \"Emerging Diseases of Man and Animals\" where in the first sentence of the introduction  he implicitly defines emerging diseases as \"infectious diseases of man and animals currently emerging as public health problems\" and as a consequence also includes re-emerging diseases:He also notes that some infectious agents are newly considered as diseases because of changing medical technologies:He concludes the introduction with a word of caution:However, to many people in the 1960s and 1970s the emergence of new diseases appeared as a marginal problem, as illustrated by the introduction to the 1962 edition of Natural History of Infectious Disease by Macfarlane Burnet:as well as the epilogue of the 1972 edition:\nThe concept gained more interest at the end of the 1980s as a reaction to the AIDS epidemic.  On the side of epistemology, Mirko Grmek worked on the concept of emerging diseases while writing his book on the history of AIDS and later in 1993 published an article about the concept of emerging disease as a more precise notion than the term \"new disease\" that was mostly used in France at that time to qualify AIDS among others.\n\nAlso under the shock of the emergence of AIDS, epidemiologists wanted to take a more active approach to anticipate and prevent the emergence of new diseases. Stephen S. Morse from The Rockefeller University in New York was chair and principal organizer of the NIAID/NIH Conference \"Emerging Viruses: The Evolution of Viruses and Viral Diseases\" held 1–3 May 1989 in Washington, DC. In the article summarizing the conference the authors write:They further note:In a 1991 paper Morse underlines how the emergence of new infectious diseases (of which the public became aware through the AIDS epidemic) is the opposite of the then generally expected retreat of these diseases:As a direct consequence of the 1989 conference on emerging viruses, the Institute Of Medicine convened in February 1991 the 19-member multidisciplinary Committee on Emerging Microbial Threats to Health, co-chaired by Joshua Lederberg and Robert Shope, to conduct an 18-month study. According to the report produced by the committee in 1992, its charge \"was to identify significant emerging infectious diseases, determine what might be done to deal with them, and recommend how similar future threats might be confronted to lessen their impact on public health.\" The report recommended setting up a surveillance program to recognize emerging diseases and proposed methods of intervention in case an emergent disease was discovered.The proposed interventions were based on the following: the U.S. public health system, research and training, vaccine and drug development, vector control, public education and behavioral change. A few years after the 1989 Emerging Viruses conference and the 1992 IOM report, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) was formed by a group of scientists as a follow-up in 1994 and the Centres for Disease Control (CDC) launched the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal in 1995.\n\nA decade later the IOM convened the Committee on Emerging Microbial Threats to Health in the 21st Century which published its conclusions in 2003.\n\nIn April 2000 the WHO organized a meeting on Global Outbreak Alert and Response, which was the founding act of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.\n\nIn 2014, the Western African Ebola virus epidemic demonstrated how ill-prepared the world was to handle such an epidemic. In response, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation was launched at the World Economic Forum in 2017 with the objective of accelerating the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases to be able to offer them to affected populations during outbreaks. CEPI promotes the idea that a proactive approach is required to \"create a world in which epidemics are no longer a threat to humanity\".\n\nClassification\nOne way to classify emerging infections diseases is by time and how humans were involved in the emergence:\n Newly emerging infectious diseases – diseases that were not previously described in humans, such as HIV/AIDS\n Re-emerging infectious diseases – diseases that have spread to new places or which previous treatments no longer control, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\n Deliberately emerging infectious diseases – diseases created by humans for bioterrorism\n Accidentally emerging infectious diseases – diseases created or spread unintentionally by humans, such as vaccine-derived poliovirus\n\nContributing factors\nThe 1992 IOM report distinguished 6 factors contributing to emergence of new diseases (Microbial adaptation and change; Economic development and land use; Human demographics and behavior; International travel and commerce; Technology and industry; Breakdown of public health measures) which were extended to 13 factors in the 2003 report (Chapter 3 of the report detailing each of them)\n Microbial adaptation and change\n Human susceptibility to infection\n Climate and weather\n Changing ecosystems\n Human demographics and behavior\n Economic development and land use\n International travel and commerce\n Technology and industry\n Breakdown of public health measures\n Poverty and social inequality\n War and famine\n Lack of political will\n Intent to harm\n\nTheir classification serves as a basis for many others. The following table gives examples for different factors:\n\nList\n\nNIAID list of Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases \nThe U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) maintains a list of Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases. The list is categorized by biodefense risk, which is mostly based on biological warfare and bioterrorism considerations. As of 2004, it recognized the following emerging and re-emerging diseases.\n\nWHO list of most important emerging infectious diseases \nIn December 2015, the World Health Organization held a workshop on prioritization of pathogens \"for accelerated R&D for severe emerging diseases with potential to generate a public health emergency, and for which no, or insufficient, preventive and curative solutions exist.\"  The result was a list containing the following six diseases:\n Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever\n Filovirus diseases (Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease)\n Highly pathogenic emerging Coronaviruses relevant to humans (MERS and SARS)\n Lassa fever\n Nipah virus infection\n Rift Valley fever\n\nThese were selected based on the following measures:\n\n Human transmissibility (including population immunity, behavioural factors, etc.)\n Severity or case fatality rate\n Spillover potential\n Evolutionary potential\n Available countermeasures\n Difficulty of detection or control\n Public health context of the affected area(s)\n Potential scope of outbreak (risk of international spread)\n Potential societal impacts\n\nNewly reported infectious diseases \nIn 2007 Mark Woolhouse and Eleanor Gaunt established a list of 87 human pathogens first reported in the period between 1980 and 2005.  These were classified according to their types.\n\nMajor outbreaks \nThe following table summarizes the major outbreaks since 1998 caused by emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases.\n<div style=\"float:left;\">\n\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) evolved from methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), otherwise known as common S. aureus. Many people are natural carriers of S. aureus, without being affected in any way. MSSA was treatable with the antibiotic methicillin until it acquired the gene for antibiotic resistance. Through genetic mapping of various strains of MRSA, scientists have found that MSSA acquired the mecA gene in the 1960s, which accounts for its pathogenicity, before this it had a predominantly commensal relationship with humans. It is theorized that when this S. aureus strain that had acquired the mecA gene was introduced into hospitals, it came into contact with other hospital bacteria that had already been exposed to high levels of antibiotics. When exposed to such high levels of antibiotics, the hospital bacteria suddenly found themselves in an environment that had a high level of selection for antibiotic resistance, and thus resistance to multiple antibiotics formed within these hospital populations. When S. aureus came into contact with these populations, the multiple genes that code for antibiotic resistance to different drugs were then acquired by MRSA, making it nearly impossible to control. It is thought that MSSA acquired the resistance gene through the horizontal gene transfer, a method in which genetic information can be passed within a generation, and spread rapidly through its own population as was illustrated in multiple studies. Horizontal gene transfer speeds the process of genetic transfer since there is no need to wait an entire generation time for gene to be passed on. Since most antibiotics do not work on MRSA, physicians have to turn to alternative methods based in Darwinian medicine. However, prevention is the most preferred method of avoiding antibiotic resistance. By reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in human and animal populations, antibiotics resistance can be slowed.\n\nScientific Advisory Group for Origins of Novel Pathogens\nOn 16 July 2021, the Director-General of WHO announced the formation of the Scientific Advisory Group for Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO), which is to be a permanent advisory body of the organisation. The Group was formed with a broad objective to examine emerging infectious diseases, including COVID-19. According to the WHO Director-General, \"SAGO will play a vital role in the next phase of studies into the origins of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the origins of future new pathogens.\"\n\nSee also\n Disease X\n Epidemiological transition\n Globalization and disease\n Pandemic prevention\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n Website of Emerging Infectious Diseases, an open-access, peer-review journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\nInfectious diseases\nMicrobial population biology\nInfectious diseases by mode of transmission"}

Paramount brought back the sing-along cartoons in 1945, now in color, and released them regularly through 1951. Two of Paramount's one-shot cartoons quietly revived the format later: Candy Cabaret (1954) and Hobo's Holiday (1963).\n\nHistory\nThe Screen Songs are a continuation of the earlier Fleischer series Song Car-Tunes in color. They are sing-along shorts featuring the famous \"bouncing ball\", a sort of precursor to modern karaoke videos. They often featured popular melodies of the day. The early Song Car-Tunes were among the earliest sound films, produced two years before The Jazz Singer. They were largely unknown at the time because their release was limited to the chain of 36 theaters operated by The Red Seal Pictures Company, which was equipped with the early Lee DeForest Phonofilm sound reproduction equipment. The Red Seal theater chain—formed by the Fleischers, DeForest, Edwin Miles Fadiman, and Hugo Riesenfeld—went from the East Coast to Columbus, Ohio.\n\nBetween May 1924 and September 1926, the Fleischers released 36 Song Car-Tunes series, with 19 using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process. The films included Oh Mabel, Come Take a Trip in My Airship, Darling Nelly Gray, Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly?, and By the Light of the Silvery Moon. Beginning with My Old Kentucky Home (1926), the cartoons featured the \"follow the bouncing ball\" gimmick, that lead the audience singing along with the film. The other 17 films in the Song Car-Tunes series were silent, designed to be shown with live music in movie theaters.\n\nThe Fleischers were ahead of the sound revolution, and just missed the actual change when Red Seal Pictures filed for bankruptcy in the fall of 1926.\n\nReleases after Red Seal Pictures\nIn 1928, the Weiss Brothers reissued through their Artclass Pictures company and other independent distributors a number of the silent \"Ko-Ko Song Car-tunes\" with new animation created for the beginnings, removing the original titles and opening original footage.\n\n For Me and My Gal (1926)\n I Love to Fall Asleep (1926)\n In My Harem (1926)\n Just Try to Picture Me (1926)\n My Sweetie (1926)\n Old Pal (1926)\n Alexander's Ragtime Band (1926)\n The Sheik of Araby (1926)\n Annie Laurie (1926)\n Oh!

Beginning in February 1929, the song cartoons returned under a new name, Screen Songs, using the Western Electric sound-on-film process. The first was The Sidewalks of New York (East Side, West Side) released on 5 February 1929. In the 1930s, the shorts began to feature such musical guest stars as Lillian Roth, Ethel Merman, Cab Calloway, Rudy Vallée, The Mills Brothers, the Boswell Sisters, and others. The series, which eventually focused on many of the \"Big Bands\" of \"The Swing Era\" continued until 1938. In 1945, Famous Studios, successors to the Fleischers, revived the Screen Songs as an all animated series. The earliest Screen Song released as part of the Noveltoons series, When G.I. Johnny Comes Home, was released on February 2, 1945.\n\nFilmography\nFleischer Studios\n\nFamous Studios\n\nFor all the shorts, the musical arrangements were made by Winston Sharples.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:150px;\"|Film\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:150px;\"|Theme\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:150px;\"|Song\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:150px;\"|Director\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:150px;\"|Story\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:150px;\"|Animation\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:150px;\"|Scenics\n!  style=\"text-align:center; width:150px;\"|Original release date\n|-\n|The Circus Comes to Clown\n|Circus|\"The Man on the Flying Trapeze\"\n|I.

{"id": "4106584", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlene%2C%20Princess%20of%20Monaco", "title": "Charlene, Princess of Monaco", "text": "Charlene ( ; born Charlene Lynette Wittstock, 25 January 1978) is Princess of Monaco as the wife of Prince Albert II. Before her marriage, Charlene was an Olympic swimmer.\n\nCharlene was born in Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). She relocated to South Africa in 1989. She began her swimming career in 1996 (winning the South African Championship) and represented South Africa at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, with her team finishing fifth in the 4 × 100-metre medley relay. Charlene retired from professional swimming in 2007.\n\nCharlene met Prince Albert at the Mare Nostrum swimming competition in Monte Carlo, Monaco, in 2000. The couple married on 1 July 2011. On 10 December 2014, she gave birth to twins Princess Gabriella and Hereditary Prince Jacques. Princess Charlene's charity work primarily revolves around sports, AIDS, and underprivileged children. Charlene founded the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation in 2012 to support her personal humanitarian endeavours.\n\nEarly life and family\nCharlene Lynette Wittstock was born on 25 January 1978 at Mater Dei Hospital in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, to Michael Kenneth Wittstock (b. 1946), a sales manager, and Lynette, née Humberstone (b. 1959), a former competitive diver and swimming coach. The Wittstock family is of German origin; Wittstock's great-great-grandparents Martin Gottlieb Wittstock (1840–1915) and his wife Johanne Luise Wittstock (née Schönknecht; 1850–1932) emigrated to South Africa from the Pomeranian village of Zerrenthin in northern Germany in 1861 to escape hardship. In South Africa, the Wittstocks worked as handyworkers and unsuccessfully prospected for diamonds. In 2014, she was given a certificate that verified her Irish ancestry.\n\nWittstock has two younger brothers: Gareth, a coffeehouse businessman in Monaco, and Sean, a promotions and events businessman in South Africa. The family relocated to South Africa in 1989, when Wittstock was 12 years old. She attended Tom Newby Primary school in Benoni, near Johannesburg, from 1988 to 1991.\n\nSwimming career\nWittstock won three gold medals and a silver medal at the 1999 All-Africa Games in Johannesburg. She represented South Africa at the 1998 and 2002 Commonwealth Games, winning a silver medal in the 4 × 100 m medley relay in the latter competition. She also was a member of the South African women's 4×100 m medley team at the 2000 Summer Olympics, which finished fifth. Wittstock finished sixth at the 2002 FINA Short Course World Championships for the 200 m breaststroke. Throughout her career, Wittstock gave swimming lessons to underprivileged children. She left her Durban-based team (the Seagulls) to join the Tuks Swimming Club at the High Performance Centre of the University of Pretoria. However, she never enrolled in classes. The Club sponsored her by providing her with free access to their pools, free coaching, accommodation, and gymnasium access.\n\nWittstock decided to leave Pretoria in January 2005, and returned to Durban; she then went to the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal, where she joined a former University of Pretoria swimming coach, Branislav Ivkovic. On 13 April 2007, Wittstock regained her title as South Africa's 50-metre women's backstroke champion when she completed the 50 m backstroke final at the Telkom SA National Aquatic Championships in 30:16 seconds, to finish third behind Australia's Sophie Edington and Brazil's Fabíola Molina. She planned to compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics in China as her swansong, but did not qualify. Previously, Wittstock had been out of competitive swimming for 18 months with a shoulder injury.\n\nMarriage\n\nWittstock met Albert II, Prince of Monaco, in 2000 at the Mare Nostrum swimming meet in Monaco. They made their public debut as a couple at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics. She accompanied him to the weddings of the Crown Princess of Sweden in 2010 and of the Prince of Wales in 2011.\n\nOn 23 June 2010, the palace announced their engagement. Her engagement ring featured a pear-shaped three-carat diamond at the centre and surrounding diamond brilliants. The ring was reported to be created by Parisian jeweller Repossi. Wittstock, who was raised a Protestant, converted to Catholicism, despite it not being a requirement in the Constitution of Monaco.\nThe future princess was also instructed in French and the Monégasque dialect, and became familiar with European court protocol.\n\nThe wedding was originally scheduled for 8 and 9 July 2011, but was moved forward to prevent a conflict with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Durban on 5–9 July, which they both attended. The couple had invited members of the IOC, including President Jacques Rogge, to their wedding.\n\nThe couple was married in a civil ceremony on 1 July 2011 in the Throne Room of the Prince's Palace. Wittstock was reported to be in tears during the wedding. The religious ceremony took place in the courtyard of the palace on 2 July, and was presided over by Archbishop Bernard Barsi. The couple honeymooned in Mozambique.\n\nOn 30 May 2014, the palace announced Charlene's pregnancy. It was confirmed on 9 October 2014 that the couple was expecting twins by the end of the year. On 10 December 2014, her twins were born at The Princess Grace Hospital Centre. Princess Gabriella was born first, followed by Hereditary Prince Jacques, who is heir apparent to the throne.\n\nPrincess of Monaco\n\nSince 2009, she has been honorary president of Ladies Lunch Monte-Carlo. Since 2010, Princess Charlene has been associated with the Nelson Mandela Foundation. In May 2011, she became a global ambassador for the Special Olympics, promoting 'respect and inclusion' for people with intellectual disabilities worldwide. She has stated that the movement is close to her heart as a former athlete, and values its role in \"using the power of sport to change lives\". In July 2011, she became a co-patron of Giving Organisations Trust, a group of South African charities that work with AIDS, underprivileged children, and environmentalism. Princess Charlene is a trustee of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, and attends their annual awards ceremony.\n\nCharlene regularly participates in fundraising events for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. She is currently the honorary president of Monaco Against Autism. In 2012, she became the patron of AS Rugby Monaco and also the honorary president of Monaco Liver Disorder and the MONAA association. In October 2012, she accompanied the Prince on a visit to Warsaw, Poland. In 2014, Charlene was the recipient of the \"Champion of Children\" Award for her commitment to children's rights, presented by the Colleagues, a social services institution. In 2016, she become the patron of the South African Red Cross Society on its 68th anniversary. In September 2016, Charlene attended World First Aid Day in Geneva as an ambassador for the event.\n\nThe Princess created the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation in December 2012, with a mission to put an end to drowning using childhood awareness and preventative measures. In September 2014, she formerly presented her foundation at the 10th Annual Clinton Global Initiative Meeting in New York City. In November 2015, Charlene partnered with the Pontifical Council and attended the 20th Annual Conference for Healthcare Workers at the Vatican, where she spoke about efforts against the global drowning epidemic. In June 2020, the Foundation made masks for residents of Monaco amidst COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2020, Charlene undertook a trip to Tbilisi, Georgia, on behalf of the Foundation. She visited the Olympic Village and sports facilities in conjunction with government officials, and later donated a travel bus to the Tbilisi Rugby Club Team. She also took meetings with Paralympic athletes and visited the Ai la foundation, a rehabilitation centre for children with hearing loss. She attended lunch with Salome Zourabichvili, the president of Georgia, at the Presidential Palace of Georgia, discussing diplomatic and philanthropic matters.\n\nHealth\nIn May 2021, while on a trip to raise awareness about the issue of rhinoceros poaching in Southern Africa, Princess Charlene caught an ear, nose, and throat infection. She had had a sinus lift and bone grafting procedure earlier in the spring. The condition led to problems with equalising pressure and prevented her from flying above 20,000 feet. She missed a scheduled appearance at the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix, as she was unable to travel back to Monaco. After multiple procedures, Charlene was medically advised to remain in South Africa, away from her family. Subsequently, she missed the tenth anniversary commemorations of her marriage in June, which Charlene stated was \"extremely difficult\" and saddened her. In August 2021, she underwent a four-hour surgery that required general anesthetic. In September 2021, she was hospitalised again because of a \"medical emergency\" pertaining to ENT complications. On 8 October 2021, it was announced that she had undergone a final procedure. She returned to Monaco on 8 November 2021.\n\nOn 16 November 2021, the palace announced that Charlene would be resting and that she had cancelled all her activities, including those of Monaco's national celebrations, owing to ill-health, especially \"deep fatigue.\" It was reported that she would spend her recovery period in a location outside Monaco. After a four-month stay at a Swiss clinic, the palace stated in March 2022 that Charlene was back in Monaco with her family and was expected to restart her duties gradually as her health further improved.\n\nIn June 2022, Charlene tested positive for COVID-19 and began self-isolation in accordance with health rules.\n\nTitles, styles and honours\n\nTitles and styles\nSince her marriage, Charlene has been styled as \"Her Serene Highness Princess Charlene of Monaco\", and bears the historical titles of her husband in the feminine.\n\nHonours\n\nNational honours\n :\n Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Saint-Charles\n  Recipient of the Medal for Physical Education and Sports, First Class\n\nForeign honours\n : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland\n : Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Italy\n\nArms and emblems\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nPrincess Charlene at the official website of the Princely Family of Monaco\nPrincess Charlene  at the official website of the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation\n\n1978 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Bulawayo\nPrincesses by marriage\nPeople from Benoni\nSouth African emigrants to Monaco\nSouth African people of Irish descent\nSouth African people of British descent\nWhite Rhodesian people\nZimbabwean exiles\nZimbabwean emigrants to South Africa\nWhite South African people\nSouth African people of German descent\nSouth African people of English descent\nPrincesses of Monaco\nSouth African female backstroke swimmers\nSouth African female breaststroke swimmers\nWhite Zimbabwean sportspeople\nCommonwealth Games silver medallists for South Africa\nOlympic swimmers for South Africa\nSouth African Roman Catholics\nConverts to Roman Catholicism from Protestantism\nSwimmers at the 1998 Commonwealth Games\nSwimmers at the 2000 Summer Olympics\nSwimmers at the 2002 Commonwealth Games\nCommonwealth Games medallists in swimming\nSouth African female models\nSouth African female freestyle swimmers\nMonegasque Roman Catholics\nNaturalized citizens of Monaco\nMonegasque people of German descent\nMonegasque people of English descent\nMonegasque people of Irish descent\nMonegasque princesses\n\nRecipients of the Order of Saint-Charles\nGrand Crosses of the Order of Saint-Charles\nRecipients of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland\nRoyal Olympic participants\nAfrican Games gold medalists for South Africa\nAfrican Games medalists in swimming\nAfrican Games silver medalists for South Africa\nCompetitors at the 1999 All-Africa Games\nMedallists at the 2002 Commonwealth Games"}

Corinthian Colleges, Inc. acquired the Institute in October 2000, and its name was changed to Bryman College.\n\nControversies\n\nWashington\nIn April 2005 the college was sued by some of its students at the Tacoma, Washington campus who claimed they did not receive proper training for their careers in medical assistant program, that they were misled about the program’s accreditation status, their eligibility to take a national certification exam, the transferability of their credits and the availability of internships.\n\nSettlement with State of California, 2007\nIn July 2007, the California Attorney General threatened to file suit against Corinthian Colleges, corporate parent of National Institute of Technology, unless it settled allegations that it has misrepresented its placement statistics; the school had been under investigation by the state attorney general's office for over 18 months.  According to a case filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Corinthian Colleges \"engaged in a persistent pattern of unlawful conduct\" by overstating the percentage of those who obtained employment from its courses, inflated information on starting salaries and made misleading or false statements about which programs it was authorized to offer and which were approved by the California Department of Education.  The suit stated that Corinthian's \"own records show that a substantial percentage of students do not complete the programs and, of those who complete the program, a large majority do not successfully obtain employment within six months after completing the course.\"  In late July, Corinthian Colleges agreed to pay $6.5 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that the chain engaged in unlawful business practices by exaggerating its record of placing students in well-paying jobs; the amount included $5.8 million in restitution to students as well as $500,000 in civil damages and $200,000 in court costs.\n\nFinancial issues\nIn July 2014, Bryman shut down its four schools in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nBryman College \t\t\nEverest Colleges, Institutes and Universities  \t\t\nStudents sue Bryman College, The News Tribune, April 12, 2005\n\nFormer for-profit universities and colleges in the United States\nUniversities and colleges established in 1960\n1960 establishments in California\nEducational institutions disestablished in 2014\nCorinthian Colleges"}
{"id": "4106591", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre%20de%20Rhodes", "title": "Alexandre de Rhodes", "text": "Alexandre de Rhodes  (15 March 1593 – 5 November 1660) was an Avignonese Jesuit missionary and lexicographer who had a lasting impact on Christianity in Vietnam. He wrote the Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, the first trilingual Vietnamese-Portuguese-Latin dictionary, published  in Rome, in 1651.\n\nBiography \n\nAlexandre de Rhodes was born in Avignon, Papal States (now in France). According to some sources, he was of Jewish origin. His paternal side was from Aragón, Spain. He entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Rome on 24 April 1612 to dedicate his life to missionary work.\n\nIn 1624, he was sent to the East Asia, arriving in the Nguyễn-controlled domain of Đàng Trong (Cochinchina) on a boat with fellow Jesuit Girolamo Maiorica. De Rhodes studied Vietnamese under Francisco de Pina before returning to Portuguese Macau.\n\nFollowing the successful visit of fellow Jesuits Giuliano Baldinotti and Julio Koga to Đàng Ngoài (Tonkin) in 1626, the superior André Palmeiro sent Alexandre de Rhodes and Pero Marques, Sr. to evangelize in this domain of North Vietnam. The two missionaries landed in Thanh Hoá on March 19, 1627 (the Feast of Saint Joseph) and arrived the capital Thăng Long (nowadays Hanoi) on July 2 (the Feast of Visitation). De Rhodes worked there until 1630, when he was forced to leave. During these three years he was in and around the court at Hanoi during the rule of lord Trịnh Tráng. It was during that time that he composed the Ngắm Mùa Chay, a popular Catholic devotion to this day, meditating upon the Passion of Christ in the Vietnamese language. He was expelled from Vietnam in 1630 as Trịnh Tráng became concerned about him being a spy for the Nguyen. Rhodes in his reports said he converted more than 6,000 Vietnamese. Daily conversation in Vietnam \"resembles the singing of birds\", wrote Alexandre de Rhodes.\n\nFrom Đàng Ngoài Rhodes went to Macau, where he spent ten years. He then returned to Vietnam, this time to Đàng Trong, mainly around Huế. He spent six years in this part until he aroused the displeasure of lord Nguyễn Phúc Lan and was condemned to death.\n\nAs his sentence was reduced to exile, Rhodes returned to Rome by 1649 and pleaded for increased funding for Catholic missions to Vietnam, telling somewhat exaggerated stories about the natural riches to be found in Vietnam. This plea by Alexandre de Rhodes helped to found the Paris Foreign Missions Society in 1659. As neither the Portuguese nor the Pope showed interest in the project, Alexandre de Rhodes, with Pope Alexander VII's agreement, found secular volunteers in Paris in the persons of François Pallu and Pierre Lambert de la Motte, the first members of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, who were sent to the Far-East as Apostolic vicars.\n\nAlexandre de Rhodes himself was sent to Persia instead of back to Vietnam. Rhodes died in Isfahan, Persia in 1660 and was buried in the New Julfa Armenian Cemetery.\n\nIn 1943, the French colony of Indochina issued a 30c postage stamp honoring him. In 2001 Vietnamese artist Nguyen Dinh Dang created a painting in homage to Alexandre de Rhodes and Nguyen Van Vinh.\n\nWorks\nWhile in Vietnam, de Rhodes developed an early Vietnamese alphabet based on work by earlier Portuguese missionaries such as Gaspar do Amaral, António Barbosa and Francisco de Pina. De Rhodes compiled a catechism, \"Catechismus pro ijs, qui volunt suscipere baptismum in octo dies divisis\", and a trilingual dictionary and grammar, . Both published in Rome in 1651, de Rhodes's works reflect his favor of this new Latin-script alphabet instead of Nôm script. Later refined as chữ Quốc ngữ, it eventually became the de facto written form of Vietnamese language in the 20th century. Meanwhile, Maiorica's catechism and devotional texts reflect the favor of chữ Nôm, which was the dominant script of Vietnamese Christian literature until the 20th century.\n\nDe Rhodes also wrote several books about Vietnam and his travels there, including:\n\n  (Rome, 1650)\n  (Lyon, 1652)\n  (Lyon, 1651), translated by Henri Albi\n  (Paris, 1653), translated into English as Rhodes of Viet Nam: The Travels and Missions of Father Alexandre de Rhodes in China and Other Kingdoms of the Orient (1666)\n  (The Glorious Death of Andrew, Catechist) (pub. 1653)\n\nNotes\n\nSources\nTigers in the Rice, W.

It was released on November 15, 1995, as the fourth single from her second studio album, The Woman in Me. Written by Twain and then husband and producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, the song lyrically speaks about Twain wanting real love and if they're not in it for love, she's \"outta here\".\n\nThe song topped the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart for two and six weeks respectively. An alternate remix was released to Australia in November 1996, peaking at number five on the ARIA Singles Chart. \"I'm Outta Here!\" was later included on Twain's 2004 Greatest Hits package, and has been performed on all of her tours. In 1997, the Eurodance group Real McCoy covered \"I'm Outta Here!\".\n\nChart performance\n\"I'm Outta Here!\" debuted at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart the week of November 18, 1995. It spent 20 weeks on the chart and peaked at number one on February 3, 1996, where it remained for two weeks; it marked her second number one country hit after \"Any Man of Mine\". The song also topped the Country Singles Sales chart for one week. Released as a double a-side single with the title track, \"I'm Outta Here!\" debuted on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 on November 28, 1995, at number 90. The song later reached a peak of number 74 on the January 6, 1996, issue; \"I'm Outta Here!\" marked Twain's second Hot 100 entry after the double a-side single \"Any Man Of Mine/Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\".\n\nIn Twain's native Canada, \"I'm Outta Here!\" debuted at number 77 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart on November 20, 1995. \"I'm Outta Here!\" rose quickly to number one, where it reached on January 8, 1996. The song spent six consecutive weeks at number one, only tying with \"Love Gets Me Every Time\" to being Twain's longest run at the top of the chart. The song also made an appearance on the RPM Adult Contemporary Chart, peaking at number 49 on March 4, 1996.\n\nWhilst previous singles like \"You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me\" and \"The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)\" were released internationally, \"I'm Outta Here was Twain's first successful single outside North America. The song became a particular hit in Australia, where an alternate version remixed by Mutt Lange was released instead. \"I'm Outta Here!\" debuted at number 37 on the ARIA Singles Chart on November 24, 1996. It climbed to its peak position of number five on January 26, 1997, where it remained for two weeks. It spent a total of 22 weeks on the chart.\n\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"I'm Outta Here!\" was shot in New York City and directed by Steven Goldmann. It was filmed on November 4, 1995, and released 11 days later. The video is radically different from Twain's previous videos, and its pop rock feel and sex appeal engendered into most of Twain's subsequent videos.\n\nThe video begins with a shot of Twain standing behind a blue light in front of a man sitting on a chair. She walks up to the man, who stands up and flips over his chair, meanwhile, the video cuts to a slow-motion shot of people dancing in a club and a shot of Twain walking up to a microphone in front of her and surrounded by many people playing drums. It cuts back to Twain trying to sit on the chair, when the man kicks it away for her to fall on the floor. But the next shot of them is them laughing and pushing away as people start to come over. In the subsequent shots, intercut with shots of Twain performing alone without the drums, Twain and several others drumming near a window, and Twain on a balcony, friends grab the microphone off of Twain and engage in a karaoke session with her, male stereotypes try to turn on Twain near the microphone, Twain teaches people a dance routine, people play air guitar with fake guitars, and Twain plays along to the drummers. In the final shot, Twain walks out of the building alone.\n\nThree versions of the video were released; the 'Album Version' for country music video channels, the 'Mutt Lange Remix' for Australia and the 'Dance Remix' for Canadian pop channels. The 'Album Version' video is available on Twain's DVD The Platinum Collection, while the 'Mutt Lange Mix' video is available on iTunes, VEVO and YouTube. The video won the Video of the Year Award at the 1996 Canadian Country Music Awards.\n\nOn video-sharing website YouTube, the video is one of Twain's least-viewed videos on the platform, with only 2.8 million views as of February 2021.\n\nLive performances\nDuring Twain's Come On Over Tour and Up! Tour, the song was performed as the last main song of the setlist before returning to the stage for her encores. Each of the cities Twain visited on both tours, she would invite a local school Marching Band drum line to join her on stage. Twain would also play the drums along as well on stage. At the end of the song on the Come On Over Tour, Twain leads the drummers into a drum roll, which leads into a grand finale, including Twain standing on top of a big drum, while an electric lap steel guitar solo plays, before disappearing into it as fireworks and confetti erupt from the stage. On the Up! Tour, she again leads the drummers in joining in a big drum roll which lets off the fireworks with Twain disappearing after the song ends. The song has also been performed during her Vegas residency and her Rock This Country tour as the last song before the encore.\n\nTrack listings\n\n US 7-inch single\nA. \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\" — 4:30\nB. \"The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)\" — 4:50\n\n US cassette single\nA. \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\" (remix) — 4:21\nB. \"If It Don't Take Two\" — 3:40\n\n Australian CD single\n \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\" (Mutt Lange Mix) — 4:21\n \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\" (dance mix) — 4:40\n \"No One Needs to Know\" — 3:04\n\n Australian remixes CD and cassette single\n \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\" (Mutt Lange Mix) — 4:21\n \"God Bless the Child\" (extended version) — 3:48\n \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\" (dance mix) — 4:40\n \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\" (album version) — 4:30\n \"No One Needs to Know\" — 3:04\n\nPersonnel\nPersonnel are lifted from The Woman in Me liner notes.\n\n Larry Byrom – acoustic guitar\n Billy Crain – slide guitar\n Paul Franklin – pedal steel guitar, pedal-bro\n Rob Hajacos – fiddle\n Dan Huff – electric guitar\n David Hungate – bass guitar\n Nick Keka – handclaps\n Mutt Lange – handclaps\n Paul Leim – drums, door slam\n Terry McMillan – harmonica, cowbell\n Matt Rollings – piano\n Brent Rowan – electric guitar\n Shania Twain – lead and harmony vocals, handclaps, footsteps\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n\nReal McCoy version\n\nIn 1997, German Eurodance Real McCoy released \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\" as the third and final single from their album \"One More Time\".

St. Anne is one of four Sunset District Catholic churches and mainly caters to the Inner Sunset area near Golden Gate Park and the University of California, San Francisco hospital campus.\n\nThe larger, rosy-red church can easily be seen from anywhere in the Inner Sunset and a MUNI streetcar has a line that travels along Judah Street in front of the Church. Every year, the parishioners of St. Anne's hold a novena honoring their patron saint, in which they have a procession around the neighborhood, commencing in the vestibule of the church.\n\nThe parish has an illustrious history, dating back to its founding in 1904. The parish grew up with the Sunset neighborhood, originally known as the \"Outside Lands,\" which were made up entirely of sand dunes extending out to present-day Ocean Beach. The first church, a small wood-frame structure, was built in 1905 on land donated by a Mrs. Jane Callahan. The church, which seated up to 450 people, was toppled in the 1906 earthquake. Though it was rebuilt and extended to accommodate the growing parish, it became apparent that a new church was needed. Groundbreaking and construction began in 1930 and the church was completed three years later and dedicated by Archbishop John J. Mitty.\n\nThe church is notable for its Romanesque-revival architecture, massive dome, uneven twin towers, great rose windows, and the frieze sculpture that adorns the front facade entrance. The sculpture, created by Mission San Jose Sister Justina Niemierski, depicts a \"scriptural account of the whole of salvation history.\" The parish school opened in 1920 and still serves the children of the neighborhood.\n\nIn addition to English, the church celebrates mass in Arabic and Cantonese, a reflection of the very diverse parish.\n\nPastors\n Fr.

She is a two-time Olympic medallist, winning a bronze medal at the 2006 Torino Games and a silver medal at the 2014 Sochi Games. She also competed at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, where she failed to reach the final. At the FIS Snowboarding World Championships, she won a bronze medal in 2011 and a silver medal in 2013. She is the 2012 Winter X Games champion, and has won the Crystal Globe as the overall FIS World Cup champion in snowboard cross five times, in 2006, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.\n\nSnowboarding career\nBorn in Petite-Rivière-Saint-François, Maltais started competing in 2002, and won the Canadian Championship in 2003 and again in 2004. Internationally, she came 5th in the World Cup during her rookie year (2003–04) with 2 podium finishes that year. In her second year (2004–05), she won the European Cup and came in 8th in the World Cup. During that World Cup she had two podium finishes, including her first gold. In the 2005 World Championships, Maltais finished 4th, letting her set her sights on an Olympic medal in Turin in 2006, the first time Snowboard Cross would be contested at the Winter Olympics.\n\nIn Turin, Maltais was in a final of four with fellow Canadian Maëlle Ricker. Ricker fell in the early stages, and Maltais crashed out of a corner farther down. After the other two racers (Tanja Frieden and Lindsey Jacobellis) finished, Maltais was able to get up and finish the race, earning her the bronze. Dominique had a disappointing 2010 Winter Olympics falling in both of her qualifying runs and therefore did not qualify for the finals.\n\nMaltais followed a disappointing Olympics with a successful start to the 2010–11 FIS Snowboard World Cup leading the World Cup snowboard cross category heading into the 2011 World Snowboarding Championships. There she managed to take third place for the bronze medal. Maltais finished the World Cup season as the overall and Crystal Globe champion in her category. This was her second overall title having previously achieved the feat in 2005–06.\n\nAt the XVI Winter X Games Maltais won her first medal which came as the gold and X Games champion in 2012. She had followed this with several successes on the World Cup tour that year, including a home nation victory at Blue Mountain. This victory, among others, helped propel her to her second straight Crystal Globe championship as the overall winner on the FIS tour. Success continued further into the following season where Maltais again won several events, in the early stages. Maltais would also find further accomplishment by winning the silver at the 2013 World Snowboarding Championships which took place in her home province of Quebec. There she would place second, finishing familiarly behind teammate Ricker who won her first World Championship gold medal there.\n\nMaltais went into the 2014 Winter Olympics as a strong medal contender with her results on the World Cup that year. At the Olympics she qualified through easily, Maltais was looking for some redemption from the previous Olympics where she crashed out in Vancouver. She qualified through from the semi's when, after a tough battle for the second position, Lindsey Jacobellis crashed when she was way out in front. This paved the way for Maltais to enter the final. In that event Eva Samkova who had dominated the event, from her fastest qualifying position through to the final, won gold but an elated Maltais followed her through for silver. The medal lifted a weight off of her and she said that \"It's a good revenge for Vancouver. I wanted to prove to the world that I could do better than in Vancouver. I'm so so happy it's done and I made it and I finished on the podium.\"\n\nPersonal\nHer father is the mayor of Petite-Rivière-Saint-François, her birthplace and hometown where she also fulfills her career as a firefighter.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n \n\n1980 births\nLiving people\nFrench Quebecers\nOlympic snowboarders for Canada\nSnowboarders at the 2006 Winter Olympics\nSnowboarders at the 2010 Winter Olympics\nSnowboarders at the 2014 Winter Olympics\nCanadian female snowboarders\nSportspeople from Quebec\nOlympic silver medalists for Canada\nOlympic bronze medalists for Canada\nOlympic medalists in snowboarding\nMedalists at the 2006 Winter Olympics\nMedalists at the 2014 Winter Olympics\nPeople from Capitale-Nationale\nX Games athletes"}

He attended school in the city Larvik, graduated from Asker Seminary in 1872 and returned to Brunlanes as a school teacher from 1872 to 1909. He was also a farmer, having bought the farm Nalum in 1881 and later the farm Foldvik. He quit as a farmer in 1926, and his son bought the farmland in 1928.\n\nHe was a member of Brunlanes municipal council from 1883 to 1916, serving as mayor since 1892. He was an elector from 1883 to 1903, before entering election himself. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway from Brunla in 1906, and was re-elected in 1909, 1912, 1915, 1918 and 1921. He served as President of the Storting during his fourth term, and also President of the Odelsting from 1920 to 1921.\n\nFrom 1916 to 1920 he was the Minister of Labour in Knudsen's Second Cabinet.

He focused on pets after he painted a friend's Boston Terrier.\nKincaid's first employment in an art field was in 1974, working as a custom motorcycle artist at \"Buzz's Psycles\" of Chamblee, Georgia. He painted restorations of classic British bikes such as the Bonnevilles and Trophies built in the middle and late 1960s by Triumph Motorcycles and did customization work. He left Georgia in 1977.\n\nInfluences\nHe has listed as major influences 1960s psychedelia, surrealism and Pop Art; Andy Warhol, Peter Max, Salvador Dalí, and other less-known genre artists. Although the medium, acrylics on canvas, has been consistent throughout his painting career, his painting style has varied throughout a limited body of work.\n\nActivities\nFrom 1977 through 1989, he made thousands of costumes, also drawing and painting costume designs and various commercial graphics projects, in partnership with his brother Doug Kincaid.  Bill Kincaid often participated in every step from the initial drawings, patterns and materials selection through the final cutting and assembly. \n\nDuring his active years with The Kincaid Karacter Company, he was instrumental in the design, development, and creation of many iconic mascot characters for some of the world's best known organizations, including \"BUDMAN\" & \"Spuds MCKENZIE\" for Anheuser-Busch (AB-InBev), \"FredBird\" for The St. Louis Cardinals, \"Little Caesar\" for Little Caesar's Pizza, and \"Elroy Elk\", the National Drug Awareness Program mascot for The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (ELKS Association). He also designed & created hundreds of other popular mascots for Ralston Purina, Six Flags, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, M-TV, Hostess Cakes, and The United States Postal Service, as well as designing & creating the character of \"Grouchie Gator\" (star of the CBS children's show \"Gator Tales\").\n\nHis non-costume & puppet related projects included props for numerous TV commercials, promotions, and industrial films, as well as board games, coloring books, and logos. From 1981 to 1999, Kincaid also created puppets, scenery and props for CBS children's television shows D. B.'s Delight and Gator Tales, plus rendered & constructed remodels of sets for Six Flags attractions.\n\nKincaid specializes in painting dogs, cats and other pets.\n\nReferences\n St. Louis Post Dispatch, January 7, 1983, \"Almost Live!

The idea for a knotting association of some kind grew from the contact between two people. Des Pawson was a retail manager for a large stationery firm based in Ipswich and a knot craftsman. Geoffrey Budworth was a Metropolitan Police Inspector and knotting consultant. Des first wrote to Geoff on 8 October 1978. They met before the month was over, and if it was not mentioned then the idea of contacting other knotting enthusiasts was raised by Des in a letter dated July, 1980, when he pressed for a suitable venue and suggested The Maritime Trust. Even then, 1981 went by without further development; and this is a source of regret to them both as it was the centenary of Clifford W. Ashley's birth.\n\n Aims   \n 2013 Constitution \n\nThe object of the Guild shall be the advancement of education by the study of and practice of the\nart, craft and science of knotting, past and present. In furtherance of this object but not otherwise\nthe Guild shall have the following powers:\n(a) To undertake research into all aspects of knotting and to publish the useful results.\n(b) To establish an authoritative body for consultation purposes\n(c) To publish a periodical or periodicals and other papers and books about knotcrafts and related subjects.\n(d) To form and maintain a library of books, papers, films, photographs and other materials about knotcrafts and related subjects, with a view to making information available to Members of the Guild, and to the general public.\n(e) To form a collection of knots and knotting and work related crafts.\n(f) To encourage the employment of knotcrafts as a manual activity in schools, and as a therapy among the physically handicapped\n(g) Research and development of innovative shoe-lace tying methods\n\nThe goals of the organization are to promote research and act as a source of reference and consultation on knots and knotting, preserve traditional techniques and promote an interest in the public, among others.  Unlike a traditional guild no level of expertise is required for membership, only an interest in knotting.\n\nMembers of the Guild assisted with revisions and corrections to The Ashley Book of Knots in 1991.\n\n Knotting Matters Knotting Matters is the quarterly news letter of the IGKT and is sent by post to all subscribed members.\nThe first issue was published in Autumn 1982 and was 17 Pages long and in Black and white, edited by Hon. Secretary Geoffrey Budworth.\nThe centennial was produced in September 2008 edited by Lindsey Philpott and was professionally printed with colour covers and was 50 pages in length. Knotting Matters is made from Guild members submissions and other news from the guild.  \n\n Founding members \nThe Guild dates from an inaugural meeting of 25 individuals aboard the Maritime Trust's vessel R.R.S. 'Discovery' berthed in St.\nKatharine's Dock in the lee of Tower Bridge London (UK) on April, 17th. 1982. Those in attendance were Ryan T. Johnson, Mr. Roy E. BAIL, Mr. C.G. BELLINGHAM, Mr. Geoffrey BUDWORTH, Mr. John CONSTABLE, Mr. Bernard J. CUTBUSH, Mrs. Anne DEVINE, \nMr. Ron W.EVANS, Mr. Sid EVANS, Mr. Eric FRANKLIN, Mr. Frank HARRIS, Mr. John HAWES, Mr. Paul HERBERT, Dr. Edward HUNTER, Miss.

Ettrick THOMSON, Mr. Don WOODS and Mr. Quinton WINCH.\n\nMrs Penny BODGER of Osgathorpe in Leicestershire, Mr. Robert CHISNALL of Kingston, Ontario, Canada, and Mr. Charles H.S. THOMASON of Queensland, Australia all expressed a wish to be involved from the outset but due to distance were unable to attend the opening meeting.\n\n International and local branches \nAlaskan Branch\nEast Anglian Branch (UK) \nFrench Branch\nGerman Branch\nMidlands Branch (UK)\nNorthwest Branch (UK)\nNetherlands \nNew Zealand \nNAB Mid-Atlantic Region\nNAB Knot In the Middle\nPacific Americas Branch\nSolent Branch\nSurrey Branch\nSouthern Ontario Knot Tyers\nSweden\nWest Country Knotters (UK)\nWest Yorkshire Branch (UK)\n\n Recognition \nIn 2001, archaeological historian Mike Loades attempted a reconstruction of a British Iron Age chariot. He called upon IGKT member Richard Hopkins for his knowledge and experience of how to use the binding and lashing materials available at that time – rawhide, hemp, and flax – and described his contribution to the project as \"invaluable\".\n\nSix knot challenge\nThis involves tying six basic knots – reef knot, sheet bend, sheepshank, clove hitch, round turn and two half-hitches and bowline – against the clock. The authenticated world record is 8.1 seconds, set by Clinton R. Bailey, Sr. in 1977. IGKT members have discussed proposals for formal rules to govern future attempts on this record.\n\nWorld Knot Tying Day\nIn 2018, the IGKT-Solent Branch promoted the idea of making the 18th of December World Knot Tying Day to celebrate and remember the author Clifford W. Ashley, who wrote and illustrated The Ashley Book of Knots''. The date was selected to coincide with Ashley's birthday (1881). Participants were asked to tie their favorite knot and also learn a new knot. Maybe also teach someone how to tie a knot? Even teaching someone to tie their shoelaces was sufficient. When the knots were tied, participants were encouraged to post a photo of their knot on their favorite social media site with the hashtag #WorldKnotTyingDay. In 2020, the IGKT shifted the day of the celebration to September 18. This date coincides with the day Ashley died (1947).\n\nSee also\nList of knots\n:Category:Knots\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website of the International Guild of Knot Tyers\nSite officiel de l'IGKT France\nVideo documentary on the history of the IGKT\n Two young Canadian Scouts, coached by members of the Southern Ontario Knot Tyers, tie the six basic Scout knots in record videorecorded time\n\nKnots\nInternational non-profit organizations\nOrganizations established in 1982\nHobbyist organizations"}

She has served as county governor of Vestland county since 2022. She previously served as Minister of Local Government from 2009 to 2013, Minister of Transport from 2005 to 2009 and party leader from 2008 to 2014. On 11 February 2014, she announced that she would retire as the leader of the party in April. She was succeeded by Trygve Slagsvold Vedum.\n\nShe was also political advisor to the Minister of Health and Social Affairs (social affairs) from 1999 to 2000. Navarsete was appointed as leader of the Centre Party in September 2008, having until then been the deputy leader.\n\nCareer\n\nParliament\nShe was elected to the Storting in the 2005 election, and was re-elected three times since. She was among many notable politicians in the Storting to not seek re-election in the 2021 election. She cited her reasons to be that it was time for a generational change in the Storting, and that she wanted to focus her time on friends and family.\n\nParty leader\nNavarsete was elected as party leader on 12 September 2008, succeeding acting leader Lars Peder Brekk, who had taken over following the resignation of Åslaug Haga.  She was re-elected on 6 April 2013, alongside her deputies Ola Borten Moe and Trygve Slagsvold Vedum. \n\nOn 11 February 2014, she announced she was stepping down as party leader and called for an exceptional convention to be held in April to elect her successor. On 7 April, Slagsvold Vedum was elected her successor.\n\nMinister of Transport and Communications\nFollowing the 2005 election, in which the Centre Party secured a majority together with the Labour and Socialist Left Party, Navarsete was appointed minister of transport and communications in Jens Stoltenberg's second cabinet on 17 October 2005.\n\nIn August 2006, Navarsete attended the opening of the first hydrogen based petrol station in Forus in Rogaland, together with Statoil CEO Helge Lund.\n\nOn 15 January 2007, Navarsete attended the opening of the Imarsund connection Aure municipality. The completion of the connection was seen as the last piece in connecting the municipality from east to west.\n\nIn September 2008, after opening the new E16 straight between Voldum and Borlaug in Lærdal, the government car Navarsete was riding in, drove 110 km/h in a 80 km/h zone. She later explained that she was working while being driven, but wouldn't classify the speeding as reckless driving.\n\nIn May 2009, Navarsete promised that a double set of railway tracks between Oslo and Lysaker would be completed by 2012. She also attended a railway forum conference, where she talked about the high demands for better maintenance of railways.\n\nMinister of Local Government\nFollowing the 2009 election, Navarsete was appointed minister of local government on 20 October through a reshuffle of Jens Stoltenberg's cabinet.\n\nIn November 2010, Navarsete expressed belief that some municipalities may have done more than they're capable of in regards to welfare offers. She also expressed that some municipalities who decided to cut their budgets could end up suffering from pains of growth.\n\nIn March 2011, she announced that one could personally be responsible for fixing bathrooms, contrary to what she previously said, where she expressed support for the bathroom tax. The tax would have required a lot of paperwork to be filled and \"growing bureaucracy\". The change was also set to go out on a parliamentary hearing come Easter. If so, the change would be put into force by autumn.\n\nAt the end of March 2012, Navarsete was revealed to have given 500 000kr to her home municipality, where her husband was deputy mayor. This was against the recommendation given by the county.\n\nJust prior to Stoltenberg's cabinet stepping down, Navarsete had called Bård Vegar Solhjell, then minister of the environment, asking if the newly planned E16 motorway could be relocated 300 metres from her house, which was accepted. Despite this, judicial experts asserted that she didn't brake the law by calling Solhjell, even though she probably shouldn't have called him directly. Several members of the Storting Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs called for the case to be brought up, though the committee leaders, Martin Kolberg and Erik Skutle, called it a \"non-case\".\n\nCounty Governor of Vestland\nOn 3 June 2022, Navarsete was nominated to become the next county governor of Vestland. She assumed office on 1 September.\n\nMedia\nNavarsete has gotten several headlines during her years of office due to her temper. The first time was in April 2011 when she yelled at a woman after being accused of betraying the districts of Norway. In September 2012, she yelled at the leader of her own party's youth organization, Sandra Borch, allegedly because Borch had expressed her support for Ola Borten Moe, the deputy leader.\n\nOn 21 February 2018, it was revealed that Navarsete received a message on Messenger from a group of party colleagues on a cabin trip in 2016, that stated \"We want your pussy\". The message was sent from former State Secretary Morten Søberg's phone, who at the time did not have his phone. Despite demanding an inquiry, none of the colleagues present at the cabin trip admitted to having sent the message.\n\nPersonal life\nNavarsete married her first husband, Odd, and the two got two daughters before she had turned 21. Twelve years later, her husband died of a heart attack and she became a single mother. She married her current husband, Lars Petter Nesse, on 16 May 2000. Nesse has a son from a previous relationship.\n\nReferences\n\n1958 births\nNorwegian Christians\nLiving people\nPeople from Sogndal\nCentre Party (Norway) politicians\nMembers of the Storting\nWomen members of the Storting\nMinisters of Transport and Communications of Norway\nMinisters of Local Government and Modernisation of Norway\n21st-century Norwegian politicians\n21st-century Norwegian women politicians\nWomen government ministers of Norway"}

McArthur became one of the most capable Federal commanders in the Western Theater.\n\nEarly life\nMcArthur was born in Erskine, Scotland. He learned to be a blacksmith and emigrated to the United States at age 23 and settled in Chicago. He was the proprietor of the Excelsior Iron Works. He also served in the Chicago Highland Guards militia unit.\n\nCivil War\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Civil War, McArthur was appointed colonel of the 12th Illinois Volunteer Infantry. Shortly after, he was elevated to command the 1st Brigade in Brig. Gen. Charles F. Smith's division and saw action at the Battle of Fort Donelson.  Even though Smith's division was deployed on the left flank of the Union line, McArthur's brigade was detached to John A. McClernand's division to extend the right flank toward the Cumberland River.  McArthur's brigade was never positioned correctly and when the Confederates made their breakout attempt, McArthur and Richard J. Oglesby's neighboring brigade suffered heavily.  Despite this both brigades withdrew in relatively good order.\n\nFollowing Fort Donelson, McArthur was promoted to brigadier general on March 21, 1862, and led the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division of the Army of the Tennessee at the Battle of Shiloh. Members of his brigade wore Scottish caps and were thus nicknamed the \"Highland Brigade\". McArthur was wounded leading his brigade in a breakout of the Confederate encirclement on the first day of Shiloh. He led his brigade during the following Siege of Corinth.\n\nFollowing the capture of Corinth, McArthur took command of the 6th Division and was ordered to reinforce Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans's Army of Mississippi, stationed at Corinth. On the eve of the Battle of Corinth, Brigadier General Thomas J. McKean arrived from St. Louis and due to his rank superseded McArthur in command of the division.  Orders were given placing McKean in command of the division but no orders were given to reassign McArthur.  Therefore, McArthur was without a command for a brief period but remained close at hand; even helping Colonel John M. Oliver position the pickets for his neighboring brigade. A staff officer at Rosecrans's headquarters remembered McArthur's predicament and a special order was immediately sent out returning McArthur to command of the 1st Brigade, 6th Division, which had recently been commanded by Colonel Benjamin Allen while McArthur was in divisional command.\n\nAfter Corinth, McArthur returned to command the 6th Division, now part of the XVII Corps. He led it during the Siege of Vicksburg and commanded the post at Vicksburg after the Confederate surrender.  He was in command of the 1st Division, XVI Corps and was involved in the pursuit of Sterling Price's Missouri Raid. His division was transferred with the rest of the corps to Tennessee, where his troops played a significant role in breaking the Confederate lines on the second day of the Battle of Nashville. He received a brevet promotion to major general of volunteers for his actions in that battle. He also led his division into action at the Battle of Fort Blakely.\n\nPostbellum life\n\nAfter the war, he was involved in a number of occupations, including Commissioner of Chicago Public Works during the Chicago Fire, postmaster of Chicago, and general manager of the Chicago and Vert Island Stone Company. In 1875, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.\n\nMcArthur died in Chicago on May 15, 1906, and was buried at Rosehill Cemetery.\n\nSee also\n\nList of American Civil War generals (Union)\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n\n Andreas, Alfred Theodore, History of Chicago, Volume 3, A.

The station is unmanned and only local trains stop there, not express or regional ones.\n\nThe  village has a population (2019) of 2,090 and a population density of .\n\nName\nThe name probably has its origin from the word vig meaning \"battle\" or \"war\", and stad meaning \"place\". There is therefore reason to believe that it was the site of a battle. The name could alternatively originate from the Old Norse word \"vigr\" which means \"spear\". North of the village there are several barrows from the Iron Age and Bronze Age.\n\nVigrestad has been spelled in various ways over the centuries: Wirestad, Virestadt, Wiresteid in 1567, Vigrist in 1606, Wigresta in 1610, Vigrestad in 1616, and Wigrestad in 1723.\n\nEconomy\nThe main source of income in Vigrestad is agriculture; mainly dairy, beef, pork, sheep, and potatoes. There are also companies that specialise in high-class timber furniture (for the Royal family, among others), and laser-cutting. A variety of industries and companies can also be found, many of them at Stokkalandsmarka, just southeast of Vigrestad.\n\nNotable residents\nElin Hetland Mong, a local politician for the party Høyre and was leader of the union Norsk Ergoterapeutforbund\nMonica Sandve, a handball player, National team, and Nordstrand (in the top league)\nEnevald Flåten, a pastor in Levende Ord Bibelsenter\n\nReferences\n\nVillages in Rogaland\nHå"}

Scholars have linked their contribution to the Christianization of Georgia, with Saint Nino leading the way of converts from paganism. Assyrians came in contact with Georgians once again in the 1760s. Assyrians under Ottoman rule were looking for some kind of protection from religious and ethnic persecution. Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East Mar Avraam requested of Georgian king Erekle II protection for Assyrians and the Yezidis of present-day Turkey. In April 1770, Georgian troops, under Russian command, headed towards the city of Akhaltsikhe. At the same time, Assyrian bishop Ishaya (Isaiah) left Tbilisi and carried letters to Assyrian and Yezidi leaders, whence the Georgian king invited them to fight together against the Ottomans. The Assyrians and Yezidis were prepared to move against the Ottomans, whenever the support from Erekle II arrived, but Russian General Totleben changed his mind and turned his detachment back to Kartli.\n\nThe plans for military cooperation failed, but during the war that ensued, an Assyrian community of several dozen families appeared in Georgia. They arrived in Makhani from Persia and the Ottoman Empire. The second wave of Assyrian immigrants arrived when Russia signed the Treaty of Turkmenchay with Persia in 1828, where Assyrians and Kurds from Iran arrived in Georgia as workers. They also arrived in the second half of the 19th century and settled in Tbilisi, becoming Russian and later Soviet citizens. By the end of the 19th century, there were over five thousand Assyrians living in Georgia. A fourth and largest wave came in between the years of 1915 and 1918, as Assyrians fled from the Assyrian genocide.\n\nToday's Assyrian community in Georgia\nOn May 15, 2005, United States President George W. Bush met with the leaders of Georgia's Assyrians.\nThe meeting was mostly about the situation of Assyrians in Iraq. Assyrian leaders also gave the American president a letter as well. \nWhen asked by Edgar Bitbunov, the Member of Assyrian International Congress\n\"Nowadays American Georgian forces are on Assyrian soil in Iraq. Of course,we aren't indifferent to the fortune of assyrians in Iraq. What's their future like? What can you say about it?\" Bush answered: \"We consider that every nation is equally responsible to find its own way to develop and achieve its own object. Assyrians are equal in right to any other peoples living in Iraq these days. Assyrians other nations in Iraq first of all should change their way of thinking, should act more persistently, resolutely and bravery to achieve their own objects and principles all these are in their hands.

He was a first cousin of Marcus Halfdan Kastrud. He finished his apprenticeship as a goldsmith in 1889, and moved to Kristiania in the same year. He was a secretary in his local trade union from 1891 to 1892 and treasurer in 1893. He was also member of the socialist youth club Friheden in both Kristiania and Sarpsborg (where he lived in 1894). He started his own goldsmith business in 1897. In November the same year he married Inga Marie Ravneberg.\n\nHe joined the Norwegian Labour Party, and became a member of the central board in 1900. From 1901 to 1918 he was the party secretary. He lost out when \"the new direction\" became dominant in 1918. \"The new direction\" had tried to replace him with Alfred Madsen at the national convention in 1915. In 1921 he quit the central board to co-found a new party, the Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway. He chaired this party throughout its existence, from 1921 to 1927. He took part at the founding congress of the Labour and Socialist International in 1923; the other Norwegian delegates were Arne Magnussen, Michael Puntervold and Olav Kringen.\n\nNilssen was a member of Kristiania (Oslo) city council from 1902 to 1910, 1914 to 1919 and 1926 to 1928. To the Parliament of Norway he was elected for the first time in the 1906 Norwegian parliamentary election. He represented his city. He was re-elected eight times, to serve a total of nine terms in Parliament. There was a hiatus between 1922 and 1927; he was never elected to Parliament for the Social Democratic Labour Party. He served as President of the Lagting from 1919 to 1921 and Vice President of the Storting from 1935 to 1945. After the reunion of Labour and Social Democratic Labour in 1927, he rejoined the Labour Party central board, this time as deputy party leader. The party had two deputy leaders—Nilssen and Edvard Bull, Sr.—to accommodate different wings within the party. Nilssen also served as Minister of Labour in the two-week Hornsrud's Cabinet between January and February 1928.\n\nHe left as deputy leader in 1939, and left the central board in 1945. His last term in Parliament ended in 1945—de facto with a hiatus from 1940 to 1945, when Germany occupied Norway and suspended Parliament. Nilssen participated in the Riksråd negotiations in 1940 between Germans and those parliamentarians who had not fled the country, in which the Presidium infamously asked King Haakon VII to abdicate. During the remainder of the occupation, Nilssen lost all his public positions. After the occupation and war, he was dropped by the Labour Party as their member of the Presidium, and was not summoned to the relevant meetings and forums. Fredrik Monsen was the party's new member of the Presidium.\n\nNilssen was a member of the supervisory committee of the Gjøvik Line from 1908 to 1919, and of the supervisory council of Norges Brannkasse. He was a school board member in Oslo from 1910 to 1922 and 1929 to 1937, and a board member of the Norwegian State Railways from 1922 and Oslo Hospital from 1933. He was a deputy board member of the Institute for Comparative Research in Human Culture from 1938 to 1940, and a deputy member of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1922 to 1940.\n\nNilssen died in November 1947 in Oslo.\n\nReferences\n\n1871 births\n1947 deaths\nNorwegian goldsmiths\nPoliticians from Lillehammer\nGovernment ministers of Norway\nMembers of the Executive of the Labour and Socialist International\nLabour Party (Norway) politicians\nSocial Democratic Labour Party of Norway politicians\nPoliticians from Oslo\nMembers of the Storting\nNorwegian people of World War II\nNorwegian State Railways (1883–1996) people\nVice Presidents of the Storting"}

The urban area is located on the west side of the Stavanger Peninsula between the North Sea and the Hafrsfjorden.  It lies about  southwest of the city centre of Stavanger. Tananger Chapel (from 1879) and Tananger Church (from 2002) are both located here.\n\nThe  village has a population (2015) of 6,377 which gives the village a population density of . Tananger has grown significantly, more than doubling in size from 1980 until 2015. Since 1 January 2017, the urban area of Tananger has been included in the Stavanger/Sandnes urban area, so separate population statistics are no longer tracked.\n\nHistory\nTananger (mentioned in sources dated to 1608), was used as a safe haven in times of bad weather. It was considered the best and deepest harbour north of Egersund. In 1650, the village was gradually settled, as the local lobster fishing was valued for its worth as an export article. Since then, trading with lobster, fish as well as exclusive articles such as tobacco, coffee, and tea, that came with the bigger ships that sought port in storms, led to the establishment of a customs station under the main customs office in Stavanger in 1777 and it lasted here until 1958. The dangerous rocks in the seas just outside Tananger made the waters so perilous that a Piloting service existed as early as 1679, but was organised in 1720 under national control. Tananger upholds its piloting service to this day, but the customers are mostly supertankers and merchant vessels.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic wars, cannon-mounted rowing boats were stationed in Tananger. During World War I, Norwegian Navy vessels were stationed here for neutrality-watch.\n\nIn 1965, the oil adventure started with Aker-Norsco establishing in Tananger as one of the first supply bases to the offshore activities.\n\nEconomy\nSeveral oil companies are located here including Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips. Apart from the oil companies, some of the major oil service companies Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes are located in the Risavika harbour area. Risavika harbour has been expanded using infill to enlarge its capacity. There are international ferries to Denmark that leave from Tananger.

(CCi) was a for-profit post-secondary education company in North America. Its subsidiaries  offered career-oriented diploma and degree programs in health care, business, criminal justice, transportation technology and maintenance, construction trades, and information technology. A remnant of the schools was owned by ECMC under the Altierus Career College brand until the last three campuses were closed in 2022. \n\nAt its peak, CCi operated over one hundred Everest, Heald and WyoTech campuses throughout the United States and Canada. The Los Angeles Times framed Corinthian Colleges as a collection of \"castoff\" schools that were taken over by Wall Street investors in 1999.\n\nCorinthian closed their campuses in Canada on February 19, 2015, after the Ontario government suspended their operating license. On April 26, 2015, following a series of legal challenges by state and federal agencies, Corinthian Colleges announced that they would cease operations at all remaining United States locations. The closure affected more than sixteen thousand students and employees. Having been extensively investigated for fraudulent behavior by several jurisdictions, Corinthian Colleges, Inc. and twenty-four of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on May 4, 2015. In June 2022, the U.S. Department of Education announced that it would cancel $5.8 billion in federal student loan debt for 560,000 students who attended Corinthian.\n\nHistory\nCorinthian Colleges was founded in February 1995 by David Moore, Paul St. Pierre, Frank McCord, Dennis Devereux, and Lloyd Holland of National Education Centers, Inc., a for-profit operator of vocational schools based in Irvine, California.

On February 19, 2015, the government of Ontario suspended the company's operation license, resulting in the immediate closure of all Canadian campuses.\n\nIn February 2015, the nonprofit Educational Credit Management Corporation took ownership of more than half of Corinthian Colleges campuses, agreeing to forgive student debt on Corinthian College's Genesis loans.\n\nOn April 26, 2015, Corinthian Colleges announced that they would cease operations at all remaining locations effective April 27, a move affecting more than sixteen thousand students and employees.\n\nOn May 4, 2015, Corinthian filed for bankruptcy in Delaware.\n\nSchools\n\nEverest\nCCi operated Everest campuses in the United States and Canada, although all US campuses were to be sold or closed beginning on July 3, 2014, leaving only the Canadian campuses under CCi's control.\n\nEverest Institute offered diploma programs. Everest College offered diploma and associate degree programs. Everest University offered diploma, associate, bachelor's, and master's degree programs. There were ten Everest University campuses across Florida, which were formerly known as Florida Metropolitan University.\n\nOn February 19, 2015, all 14 Everest campuses in Ontario, Canada were shut down. 2300 students and over 500 staff were affected by the closures. CCi has since filed for bankruptcy in Canada due to the closures.\n\nEverest University Online\nEverest University Online (EUO), a division of Everest University, offered online degree programs. EUO was headquartered in Tampa, Florida.\n\nEverest College Phoenix\nEverest College Phoenix offered bachelor's degree, associate degree, and diploma programs.

In January 2010, CCi announced that it had completed the acquisition. CCi retained the Heald name, and it was reported that it also retained its faculty and staff.\n\nWyoTech\n\nWyoTech offered career-oriented training for mechanical and technical occupations.  WyoTech had campuses in Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and Wyoming. As of November 2018, all the campuses except the Laramie, Wyoming campus were closed; the remaining Laramie campus came under new ownership, providing solely automotive-related training.\n\nAccreditation\n\nEverest College Phoenix campuses were regionally institutionally accredited by Higher Learning Commission.  Heald College campuses are regionally institutionally accredited by the Senior College and University Commission – Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC Senior).  Everest Institute, Everest College, Everest University, and Wyotech campuses are nationally institutionally accredited by one of two national accrediting agencies: Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC); or Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).\n\nLeadership \nCorinthian CEO Jack Massimino earned $3 million in 2010, and four other executives made over $1 million that year. Eeva Deshon, the president and CEO of Heald College initiated a petition on Change.org to collect positive testimonials about the college, despite the largely negative evaluations by students.\n\nFaculty and students\nAs of December 31, 2013, CCi's total student population was 77,584. As with the entire education sector, CCi had faced a decrease in enrollment and a corresponding depressed stock price.  CCi's top mutual fund holder was Wells Fargo Advantage Small Cap Value Fund.\n\nAs of June 30, 2013, CCi had approximately 15,200 employees in North America, including 6,000 full-time and part-time faculty members. For five consecutive years, CCi had been named a Top Workplace in Orange County, California where its headquarters are located.\n\nIn 2014, a librarian at the southern California campus of Everest College quit her position when she learned a student she was assisting could only read at the third-grade level, may have a developmental disability, and was unlikely to find work in his chosen field. She stated that the student was unlikely to understand the financial burdens of the enrollment documents he signed. The librarian resigned out of principle after an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the issue with administration.\n\nFinancial aid\nThe Higher Education Act provides that a private, for-profit institution, such as CCi's institutions, may derive no more than 90% of its revenue from the Title IV federal student aid programs. In 2010, CCi reported that it received 81.9% of revenue from Title IV federal student aid programs.\n\nCorinthian Colleges (CCI) acquired QuickStart Intelligence in summer 2012, an Irvine, California-based, privately held technology training company. As a B2B revenue stream; CCI acquired QuickStart Intelligence to leverage the 10%, non-government funding essential to back the additional student loans for CCi's core adult learning programs.\n\nStudent loan default rate\nA significant requirement imposed by Congress is a limitation on participation in Title IV programs by institutions whose former students default on the repayment of federal student loans in excess of specified rates (\"Cohort Default Rates\"). On March 25, 2013, CCi received a draft three-year Cohort Default Rates from the U.S. Department of Education for students who entered repayment during the federal fiscal year ending September 30, 2010 (the \"2010 Cohort\"), measured over three federal fiscal years of borrower repayment. The weighted average of CCi's institutions was 19.0%, a 9.0 percentage point decrease from the 28.0% weighted average for the three-year cohort default rate for students who entered repayment during the prior fiscal year.  For the 2010 Cohort, none of CCi's institutions exceeded the default threshold set by the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nLoan forgiveness\nOn June 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education announced it would forgive $5.8 billion in federal student loans made to Corinthian College students between 1995 and 2015, which forgiveness would impact 560,000 borrowers and would be the single largest discharge of student loans in history according to the department.\n\nLegal proceedings\n\nCorinthian Colleges was investigated in Canada and by federal authorities in the United States, and by several states attorneys general for deceptive advertising and other fraudulent acts.\n\nCalifornia\nIn 2008, a class action suit was filed against CCI and a wholly owned subsidiary in Santa Clara Superior Court on behalf of graduates of Bryman College's medical assistant vocational programs. The lawsuit alleged that Bryman made untrue or misleading statements to students related to employment success, in order to induce them to enroll and stay enrolled in their medical training programs.  This case was ultimately dismissed.\n\nIn July 2007, the California Attorney General threatened to file suit against Corinthian Colleges. Corinthian issued a statement saying: \"We disagree with the Attorney General's conclusions, but we are pleased to have this matter behind us. The agreement is not evidence of wrongdoing, and the company specifically denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. We are fully committed to providing quality education and job placement services for students and to being in compliance with state law and regulation.\"\n\nIn October 2013, the State of California again sued CCi alleging \"false and predatory advertising, intentional misrepresentations to students, securities fraud and unlawful use of military seals in advertisements\". According to the Sacramento Bee, fourteen Everest College campuses registered three-year default rates on student loans of more than 20 percent; eight were more than 30 percent.\n\nIn November 2013, CCi issued a statement asserting that the California Attorney General's complaint was \"a document built on a foundation of misquoted, deceptively excerpted and—at best—misunderstood materials.\" It went on to say that the California Attorney General was \"wrongly accusing our schools of inflating job placement statistics for our graduates\". CCi indicated that it planned to \"vigorously defend the integrity of the work we do for our students and graduates\".\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala Harris filed a complaint alleging that CCI had engaged in a predatory marketing campaign targeting job seekers and single parents with incomes near the federal poverty level.  The Department of Justice obtained internal company documents in which CCI employees described the company's target demographic as \"isolated\", \"impatient\", individuals with \"low self-esteem\", who have \"few people in their lives who care about them\" and who are \"unable to see and plan well for future\". The complaint alleged that CCI had used aggressive Internet and telemarketing campaigns, as well as television ads on daytime shows like Jerry Springer and Maury Povich to reach these individuals.\n\nFederal investigation in the United States\nOn October 17, 2007, U.S. Department of Education investigators seized records at Florida campuses of for-profit colleges, including CCi's former National School of Technology in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Florida Career College (a division of Anthem Education Group) in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida and Pembroke Pines, Florida. The school reported that it was not informed why the records were seized or why similar actions had been taken against other institutions in the area. The campus reopened the next day.\n\nIn June 2013, CCi disclosed that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CCi is cooperating with the SEC in its investigation. The SEC did not file any actions against CCi in connection with this investigation.\n\nIn November 2013, the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that they were investigating CCi. In December 2013, CCi received a \"Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise\" letter from the CFPB. CCi responded by stating that it \"believes that its acts and practices relating to student loans are lawful and that its lending program is essential to many students\". The company also explained that the loans offered under the program are \"modest in size and have reasonable interest rates\", and that the loans allow many students to attend college who otherwise would not have the opportunity to do so. The average loan amount per borrower is $4,700 and the average annual interest rate is 8.5 percent and the maximum rate is 9.9 percent. Loans are only offered to students who have a gap between their educational costs and the available financial aid from all other government and personal sources. The CFPB filed a lawsuit against Corinthian in September 2014 over its loan program and debt collection practices.\n\nIn April 2015, the college was fined almost $30 million by the U.S. Department of Education. The department found the school had misled students and loan agencies about the prospects for graduates to find jobs. Within two weeks, the college shut down.\n\nIn May 2018, a federal judge ordered the U.S. Department of Education to stop collecting on student loans related to Corinthian. In October 2019 the same judge held U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in contempt of court because the Department had continued collecting on 16,000 such loans in spite of the court order.\n\nLoan forgiveness\nOn June 1, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education announced that it would cancel all federal student loans owed by more than 560,000 students who attended Corinthian Colleges between 1995 and 2015. The amount forgiven would total $5.8 billion and would be the single largest discharge of student loans in history according to the department.\n\nOther state investigations\nIn 2004, a former student from Florida Metropolitan University initiated an action against CCi, claiming he was misled with respect to the school's accreditation and his ability to transfer credits. The lawsuit proceeded in arbitration pursuant to the agreement between the parties. After hearing all of the evidence, the arbitrator found in favor of CCi on all counts and dismissed the lawsuit.\n\nIn April 2005, fourteen students from Bryman College's Tacoma, Washington campus filed an action against CCi in the Superior Court of the State of Washington. The students claimed they did not receive proper training for their careers in medical assisting, that they were misled about the program's accreditation status, their eligibility to take a national certification exam, the transferability of their credits, and the availability of internships. The case was moved to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and was ultimately dismissed.\n\nIn August 2007, the State of Florida closed an investigation into Florida Metropolitan University with no fines, penalties or findings of wrongdoing. The Florida Office of the Attorney General and Florida Metropolitan University entered into an Assurance of Voluntary Compliance acknowledging that Florida Metropolitan University participates in the Florida Statewide Course Numbering System to facilitate the transfer of eligible credits to other institutions. Florida Metropolitan University agreed to continue its efforts to help students with transfer credits and to provide students with clear disclosures.\n\nCCi is awaiting the outcome of regulatory investigations by the SEC and state prosecutors. On January 24, 2014, the Iowa Attorney General's office notified CCi that it is leading an investigation by thirteen states into CCi's business practices. CCi stated that it intends to cooperate. No state attorney general case has been tried and no findings adverse to CCi have been made.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, fifteen former and current students of Corinthian Colleges announced they were going on \"debt strike\", refusing to pay loans accrued for their time at Corinthian schools. They originally called themselves the \"Corinthian 15\", and after growing, as of April 1, are known as the \"Corinthian 100\" with 107 members. They are currently pursuing \"Defense to Repayment\" legal action against Corinthian. Representatives were given a meeting with the Department of Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n \nEducation companies established in 1995\nCompanies disestablished in 2015\nFormer for-profit universities and colleges in the United States\nCompanies formerly listed on the Nasdaq\nCompanies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015\n1995 establishments in the United States\n2015 disestablishments in California"}
{"id": "4106762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda%20Life", "title": "Honda Life", "text": "The Honda Life is an automobile nameplate that was used on various kei car/city cars produced by Honda: passenger cars, microvans, and kei trucks. The first series of the nameplate was built between 1971 and 1974, with the nameplate revived in 1997 and used until 2014. The Japanese-market Life has rarely been marketed outside Japan.\n\nIn 2020, Dongfeng Honda revived the \"Life\" nameplate in China as a rebadged variant of the Fit produced by Guangqi Honda.\n\nFirst generation (1971)\n\nThe original Life range was offered as a two-door or four-door hatchback and in a three-door wagon model (also sold as a commercial van), replacing the Honda NIII360. Compared with the previous Honda minicar series, passenger comfort was improved to make this a better family car - indeed, Honda's target was to make a kei which was as habitable as a period 1-liter car. The wheelbase, at , was eight cm longer than that of the predecessor. The entire Life range had a water-cooled Honda EA 356 cc engine, usually producing  at 8,000 rpm. which began as the air-cooled engine borrowed from the Honda CB450 motorcycle. The top speed of the sedan is . The sprint to 100 km/h (62 mph) came up in 34.9 seconds in a period test. In September 1972, the tall and curiously shaped \"Life Step Van\" was introduced, with either three or five doors. A pickup version of this was later added to the lineup, but had minimal impact on the market.\n\nThe engine was also installed with a balance shaft to reduce vibration. The engine was called \"refined\" in period tests, and was considered to be as quiet and smooth as some four-cylinder engines. The change to a water-cooled engine also eliminated the smell in the heating system commonly associated with air-cooled engines that drew the heated air into the passenger compartment. Another improvement was that the gearbox was separate from the engine, unlike in the N-series where the gearbox was in the sump (as for the original Mini). Production of the Life coincided with the larger Honda Civic with both vehicles having introduced a timing belt (rather than chain) for the operation of the overhead cam.\n\nThis version of the Life was exported to a few markets such as Australia, where the four-door version (same specs as in the Japanese version) entered the market in the middle of 1972. The two-door N360/600 continued on sale alongside. The Life was only produced for four years, as the Civic proved to be much more popular both in Japan and internationally, and when the decision was made to cancel the Life, it ended Honda's production of a passenger kei car until 1985, with the introduction of the Honda Today. At the time, the Life was ¥350,000, and the Civic was ¥400,000. The Civic also had an advantage of size, making the car safer in a collision.\n\nDevelopment\n1971, June 1\nThe Life emerged as the successor to the Honda NIII360. It was fitted with a series of newly designed two-cylinder 356 cc SOHC, liquid-cooled four-stroke engines equipped with a balancer shaft. For strictly urban use, a lower-revving engine with a lower compression (8.0:1, as opposed to 8.8:1 for the higher powered version) was installed in the \"Life Town\". For this version, which was a no-cost option across the range, the engine output was dropped to  at 6,500 rpm - as opposed to 8,000 rpm for the high-compression unit. It also received a three-speed transmission, meaning that top speed was limited to 90 km/h.\n1971, July 20\nAn all-new, three-speed, fully automatic transmission was made available. Unlike the manual, the automatic's shifter was column-mounted.\n\n1971, September 6\nA three-door commercial-use \"Van\" was added, with unique bodywork from the B-pillars back. Slightly taller than its sedan counterparts, like them the Life Van was also available with the full automatic transmission.\n1971 October 25\nA private-use version of the Life Van (called \"Wagon\", chassis code WA) was added, priced midway between the two- and four-door sedans. This could also be equipped with the three-speed automatic. The Van can be told from a wagon by its tattletale luggage rails visible through the rear windows.\n1972, May 1\nA sporty engine with twin constant velocity carburettors was added, for the new \"Touring\" range. The all two-door lineup consisted of the SS, SL, and the GS on top. Power was up to  at 9,000 rpm, and the top-of-the-line GS received a dogleg five-speed gearbox to take full advantage of the peakier engine. The Touring GS could reach a top speed of . On June 15 of the same year, the Life received a minor facelift with redesigned grilles, and in September four-door versions of the Touring range appeared. Production of the lower-powered \"Town\" engine also came to an end during 1972.\n1972, September 20\nThe Life Step Van was launched, the packaging of which embodies the tall wagon style so popular for current keis.\n1973, August 21\nThe Life Pickup was released. At the same time, the sedan lineup underwent a minor facelift (another new grille) and the lineup was reshuffled. The automatic option was now only available on one two-door and one four-door model.\n1974, October\nIn the face of an ever-contracting Kei class combined with ever more stringent emissions standards, manufacture of the Life series, along with the Z360/600, came to an end. This ended Honda kei passenger car participation, until the 1985 arrival of the Today.\n\nLife Step Van\n\nThis Step Van type variant, which shares the VA chassis code with the low-bodied Life Van, also uses the same  356 cc, two-cylinder water-cooled engine as does the rest of the range. At the time of introduction, its appearance was considered a novel approach, but it had some benefits in that the engine was installed up front and with front wheel drive. The Step Van, while its loading space was shorter, it could offer certain interior space advantages such as a very low and flat floor that competing, rear-wheel drive vehicles couldn't provide at the time. It drew many influences from the DKW Schnellaster produced in Europe. Its appearance, while unique and not appreciated when new, is now the standard approach for current kei products from Japanese manufacturers. The rear gate was of a clamshell style, divided horizontally. The  Step Van, like the regular Life Van, could carry  with two occupants, down to  with the full complement of two more passengers.\n\nThe van was first sold on 20 September 1972 with production ending in 1974, at an introductory price of ¥376,000 for the standard Step Van and ¥403,000 for the Super DX version. The Step Van series was only ever available with a four-speed manual transmission. The price of the Standard model had crept up to ¥388,000 by the time of the introduction of the pickup version. A total of 17,165 vehicles were produced, for a total of less than half the projected 2,000 units per month. It also can be found in the Gran Turismo 4, Gran Turismo (PSP), Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6 videogames, as the Honda Life StepVan.\n\nLife pick-up\n\nIntroduced on 21 August 1973, this version of the Life was designed as a pickup truck. The pick-up received the PA chassis code. In spite of weighing only , the Life Pickup could carry a  payload. Production ended in 1974, with no more than 1,132 vehicles produced, as the Honda TN7 cab over truck with its considerably longer bed proved to be more popular.\n\nSecond generation (1997)\n\nIn 1997, the Life name was resurrected for a new line of small, front-wheel-drive 5-door MPV style cars, which required a redesign for 1998 because of new Japanese taxing regulations. The Life used the three-cylinder Honda E07A engine. It replaced the Honda Today and was available exclusively in Japan at Honda Primo dealerships. This bodystyle appearance was introduced in response to the popularity of the Suzuki Wagon R, which found many buyers, and competes with the Daihatsu Cuore, Subaru Pleo, and the Mitsubishi Toppo in the \"tall wagon\" segment of kei cars.\n\nIt was introduced as a revision of the 1970s \"StepVan\" appearance, sharing the second generation Honda Today's basic componentry. Powertrain and chassis, interior and dimensions are almost identical with the Honda Today. The JA4 Honda Life is an interim model as subsequent changes in the laws regulating kei cars made it outdated very soon. This version was only built for about one and a half years. Because of this, it has become a very rare car.\n\nIt used the Honda E07A engine, 660 cc SOHC 3-cylinder, four valves per cylinder, with Honda's PGM-FI as standard equipment. It was offered with a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission.\n\nIt was also included with a driver side \"SRS\" airbag, heat absorption ultraviolet radiation glass, antibacterial steering wheel, and an antilock brake system available options. Grade system was the three grades of \"B\", \"G\" and \"T\". The use of one windshield wiper for the front windshield was carried over from the Honda Today.\n\nChronology\n 1997 April 18\n Revived the name \"Life\".\n 1997 December 15\n Bargain grade \"b\" model added, still featuring AM/FM tuner with cassette deck, keyless entry, driver seat side armrest, body color colored door mirrors, bumper, door handles, special seat upholstery. Later announced the special specification car pricing affordable equipping seat headrests, vanity mirror, intermittent front / rear wiper, wheel caps. The \"Super Select\" trim package was added January 4, 1998.\n\nThird generation (1998)\n\nResponding to new legislation, the 1998 model was bigger than its short-lived second generation counterpart, with  length and  width.\n\nIn December 2000, a turbocharged variant named Honda Life Dunk was introduced as 2001 year model. The Honda Life Dunk and the Honda That's were listed by Forbes magazine as among the weirdest car names.\n\n\"Kei-Mover\" appeared as a new version in the lineup. Practicality, safety, and environmental performance were prioritized, improving economic efficiency.\n\n1998 October 1\nAs the standard was revised in minicars, the body was lengthened to 3,395 mm and the width increased to 1,475 mm, which allowed for improvements in collision safety performance. Safety was increased further by the SRS airbags which are also standard equipment, also in the passenger seat.\n\nCorresponding to the enlargement of the second generation body, the engine was changed from the E07A to the improved E07Z. About 20% while improving low rpm torque, low-emission vehicles (LEV) became in compliance. In 5-speed MT and 3-speed AT with follow basically the second transmission, the AT car (Column Shift) was adopted. A new four-wheel drive powertrain is introduced.\n\nChronology\n 1998 October 8\n Perform a full model change, the market from next October 09.\n 1999 December 16\n \"G\", based on privacy glass (rear tailgate) door mirrors door handles tailgate handles outer body same color, remote control electric door mirrors, CD player etc. equipped & AM / FM tuner, and a cloth seat covers only special edition models employing the side door linings clad \"Minuet\" was released.\n 2000 May 15\n The traditional \"T\" instead of the, CD player with AM / FM tuner, automatic air conditioning, privacy glass (rear tailgate), and equipped with electric remote door mirror body same color door handles, full performance and comfortable \"L \"was added.\n 2000 October 19\n \"G\" on the base, equipped with door handles and tailgate handles outer body having the same remote control electric door mirrors, Audio-less specification and customized for sensitive, special pricing $ 200 cheaper than car-based specification car, \"select\" was released.\n 2000 December 20\n Turbo charger models were given the trim package name Honda Life Dunk\n 2001 May 24\n Minor changes made.

{"id": "4106786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumyantsev%20Museum", "title": "Rumyantsev Museum", "text": "The Rumyantsev Museum evolved from the personal library and historical collection of Count Nikolay Rumyantsev (1754–1826). Its origin was in St. Petersburg in the Rumyantsev house or mansion, building number 44 on the English Embankment overlooking river Neva. After Nikolay died in 1826, his brother Sergei converted the house into a museum. It was opened to the general public in 1831, initially for one day a week, and the remaining days were for study.\n\nMaintenance difficulties were among the reasons for the shift of Rumyantsev Museum to Moscow, despite it being affiliated to the Public Library in Saint Petersburg since 1845. In 1862, Nikolay's collection was combined with others, including paintings from the Hermitage Museum, and renamed the Moscow Public Museum and Rumyantsev Museum. By 1917 there would be four name changes and the collection grew to 1.5 million items. This increased to 2.7 million in the next three years following an expropriation and nationalisation campaign. A number of notable people used the library such as Dmitri Mendeleev, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy.\n\nIn 1921 the museum and library were administratively and formally separated. A second deposit copy was permitted. In 1924, weeks after the death of Lenin, despite there being some contenders for Lenin's legacy such as the Public Library in Saint Petersburg, Rumyantsev Museum was reorganized as the Lenin Library. The Rumyantsev library became a part of the Lenin Library while other holdings were dissolved among the Tretyakov Gallery, Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts and the State Museum of Oriental Art among others. The Lenin Library would go on to become the Russian State Library in 1992.\n\nHistory\n\nSt. Petersburg (1828–1861) \n\nOn the death of Count Nikolay Rumyantsev in 1826 his brother Count  inherited his property. Sergei knew that his brother Nikolay had wanted his personal art and book collection to be accessible to society. For this he decided to use the , located on the English Embankment in St. Petersburg, where Nikolay's collections were already stored. The Rumyantsev Museum was established in 1828. A decree was signed on 22 March 1828 regarding its establishment. The collection was gifted to the government. It was opened to the general public in 1831; initially one day a week for the general public and the remaining days for scholars.\n\nThe museum's collections, evolving from Count Nikolay Rumyantsev's own, included books and manuscripts, art, coins, medals, items from Russian voyages and circumnavigations, and from places such as the Museum of Antiquities in Vilnius. The collection of valuable books totaled to about 29,000 while other items numbered in the hundreds. The library included books from between the twelfth and nineteenth centuries. In his lifetime Rumyantsev had funded expeditions and excavations across the world. He also personally sent people across Russia to find books. Employees including a librarian and bibliographer helped Rumyantsev amass his collection. Assistant's included Friedrich von Adelung who was known for collecting foreign reports on Russia. Collaborators included Alexander Vostokov and Eugene Bolkhovitinov. Students of history such as Nikolay Karamzin used these historical resources.\n\nAn architect was involved in the conversion of the house(s) into a museum. It was at this stage in the mid-1830s when 12 columns were added to the front built up from the first floor. A pediment was added with sculpting by Ivan Martos. The sculpting on the pediment is inspired by mythology connected with Mount Parnassus, Apollo-Musagets, Mnemosyne and the Muses, a shout-out to the buildings' purpose as a museum as well as a reference to Rumyantsev. At a later date the pediment was engraved with the words of Nikolay, \"for (the) good (of) enlightenment\", also translated as \"for the benefit of education\", with the entire engraving reading as, \"From the State Chancellor Count Rumyantsev for the good enlightenment\" (Russian: ).\n\nSince 1845 the Rumyantsev Museum was affiliated with the Imperial Public Library in St. Petersburg. Dmitry Buturlin, the director of the Imperial Public Library, was the museum director. Vladimir Odoevsky was actively associated with the library for about 15 years and during its shift to Moscow, continued as the library director. During the last few years of the museums' life in St. Petersburg the maintenance of the library proved difficult.\n\nIn 1863 the Rumyantsev house was sold to the editor of a newspaper. Further changes were made to the house by successive owners. 1930s onwards the house was used by the Museum of the History of Leningrad, now the State Museum of the History of Saint Petersburg.\n\nMoscow (1862–1924) \n\nIn May 1861 under the vision and advice of  and his predecessor a decree for the \"first public museum in Moscow\" was framed and during the following year approved by Alexander II of Russia, then the emperor. The contents of the Rumyantsev Museum in St. Petersburg was shifted to Moscow and combined with other items including those from the Moscow University. Pictures were transferred from the Hermitage Museum. There had been certain discontentment among sections of society in St. Petersburg related to the shift of the library to Moscow.\n\nThe official founding date of the Moscow Public Museum and Rumyantsev Museum (MPRM) is 19 June 1862 when the regulations related to it were passed. While some collections such as the zoological collection were transferred to Moscow University, the Rumyantsev Museum, at the turn of the century, had a library and departments for antiquities, paintings, and ethnography among others. Katia Dianina of the department of Slavic Languages and Literatures of the University of Virginia writes that the shift of the museum to Moscow and its opening was the beginning of the city's \"cultural renaissance\".\n\nThe museum has undergone a number of changes in name,\n\nIts collection included paintings from the Old Masters and some more recent artists. Fyodor Pryanishnikov's collection was part of the museum.  Leonid Pasternak's painting of Tolstoy was hung there.  Pavel Tretyakov gave the museum Vladimir Borovikovsky's \"Portrait of Amvrosy Podobedov\". In 1862 the Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther was given to the museum. The collection included the Archangel Gospel. Ivan Tsvetaev was a curator until he went on to found the Pushkin Museum in 1912. \n\nIn 1915 a new gallery opened with different floors holding Italian, French, Dutch and Russian works. There was also a section for Japanese and Chinese art. In 1900 the first dedicated space within the Pashkov House was created for the work of Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov and would remain the only named hall, the Ivanov Hall, of the museum library. In December 1921 the museum and library were administratively separated. The library was given the name \"State Rumiantsev Library\". A second deposit copy was permitted.\n\nDmitri Mendeleev, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy used the library. Sophia Tolstaya visited the library a number of times, including visits related to her husband Leo. Lenin also used and interacted with the library. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, without the means to enroll in formal education during the period of 1873–1876 in Moscow, used the library's scientific literature during those three years. By 1917, the collection included 1.5 million items. This almost doubled to 2.7 million by 1920 following an expropriation and nationalisation campaign.\n\nLenin died on 21 January 1924. His name carried weight and to name an institution after him was an incentive for ensuring state funding in a difficult period. Despite the presence of contenders for Lenin's legacy, for example the Public Library in Saint Petersburg, on 5 February 1924 it was communicated that the Rumyantsev museum library would be renamed after Lenin and in the coming months it was made a national library.

{"id": "4106799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda%20N360", "title": "Honda N360", "text": "The Honda N360 is a small front-engine, front-wheel drive, two-door, four-passenger car manufactured and marketed by Honda from March 1967 through 1970 in Japan's highly regulated kei class — as both a two-door sedan and three-door wagon.\n\nAfter a January 1970 facelift, the N360 became the NIII360 and continued in production until June 1972. A larger-engined variant, the N600, was marketed through 1973. All models used a straight forward two-box design that complied with kei dimensional regulations — though vehicles with the 401 cc and 598 cc engines exceeded the kei engine displacement limits and were largely intended for markets outside Japan.\n\nThe N360 featured front wheel drive and an air-cooled, four-stroke, 354 cc,  two-cylinder engine. While ultimately derived from Honda's motorcycle engines, the N360E engine has a 360-degree crankshaft angle (\"parallel twin\") unlike the 180-degree \"vertical twin\" setup typically used on Honda's two-cylinder motorcycle engines. This same engine was used in the Honda Vamos, where it was coupled with a beam axle/leaf spring rear suspension.\n\nThe simple N360 name, along with its variants, used the \"N\" prefix, which stood for norimono and translated from Japanese to English as vehicle (or car) —  distinguishing the cars from the company's motorcycle offerings.\n\nIn 2012, Honda introduced the Honda N-One, an homage inspired by the 1967–1973 N sedans.\n\nVersions\n\nHonda marketed the N360 as a two-door sedan, with a three-door wagon (considered a commercial vehicle in Japan, and therefore called a \"Light van\") called the LN360 arriving in June of the first year. It has a horizontally divided rear gate and boxier rear bodywork for maximum load capacity. The LN360 had the same 31 PS engine as the sedan, and a top speed of . After a January 1970 facelift it became the LNIII 360, with a new non-reflective dash, bigger turn signals, and the same new front end as the sedan. The LNIII 360 was built until late 1971, when the Life Van took over.\n\nThe N360 was an all new, clean-sheet product, and did not share its chassis with the Honda Sports roadster, or the Honda L700 commercial platform. The N360 was a new market segment for Honda, providing an affordable, reliable, and easy-to-maintain vehicle that had broad market appeal to private car ownership. The roadsters and trucks built up to then had specific, targeted appeal.\n\nThe engine's technological specifications reflected engineering efforts resulting from the development of the larger Honda 1300, which used an air-cooled 1.3-litre engine. One of the primary differences between the N360 and the Honda Life that followed was the N360/600 had an air-cooled engine, and the Life had a water-cooled engine. The water-cooled engine was better able to comply with newly enacted emission standards in Japan, and reflected an industry wide move away from air-cooled as well as two-stroke engines. As does the original Mini, but unlike the succeeding Life, the N360/600 had its gearbox mounted in the sump rather than bolted on as a separate unit. The N360E engine was unusual in several ways: its two cylinders sat rather far apart, with the cam chain running between them. Unlike most air-cooled automobile engine, it does not use an oil cooler. The two pistons travel together, eliminating the need for a distributor but making for additional vibrations. It uses either a single or double constant velocity (CV) carburetor of comparatively large bore; this design helps it run smoothly at low engine speeds in spite of the parallel twin engine layout.\n\nAn upgraded  engine was added in October 1968 for the N360 TS, which was sold as the N360 Touring following a minor update in January 1969. The updated version is referred to as the NII. A 401.54 cc engine was used in the similar N400, a model sold in certain export markets beginning in late summer 1968. This occupied the narrow slot between the 360 and the 600; in most markets where it was available it was only sold as the N400 L with better equipment. The Hondamatic-equipped N360AT which appeared in August 1968 was the first kei car equipped with an automatic transmission.\n\nN600\nThe larger-engined N600 was developed alongside the N360 in order to target export markets like the US and Europe, where motorways demanded higher top speeds. It was also briefly sold in the domestic Japanese market, however, where it went on sale in July 1968 as the N600E. Only 1,500 examples were sold until early 1969 when the N600 was discontinued in Japan; because of its larger engine it did not qualify for any of the tax and insurance breaks given to kei cars even though it was as small as one.\n\nJust seven months after road testing the N360, Britain's Motor magazine tested a Honda N600 in November 1968. They reported that it had a top speed of  and could accelerate from 0- in 19 seconds. An overall fuel consumption of  was achieved. The test car was priced in the UK at £589 including taxes, at a time when the Mini 850 was retailing for £561. The testers were impressed to find 1100 cc performance from a 600 cc car, but found it 'very noisy when extended'. They found the Honda as easy to drive and park, and 'quite well equipped'. The performance figures put the car at or near the top of its class under most criteria, reflecting its favourable power-to-weight ratio. The car was thus  faster than the  achieved by rival magazine Autocar in an N360 in May 1968, and more than ten seconds quicker to  which the N360 achieved in 29.3 seconds. Consistent with its slower performance, the N360 squeezed 3 extra miles out of a (UK) gallon of fuel, managing an overall .\n\nThe N600 was introduced to the United States as the 600 Sedan in 1969 as a 1970 model, and was the first Honda automobile to be officially exported to the United States by the Honda Motor Company (a small number of sports cars had been imported privately in years prior). Sales were originally limited to Hawaii, but cars were soon exported to the US West Coast by 1970. It was technologically advanced for its time, with an all alloy engine that could achieve 9000 rpm. Engine output was 36–45 hp (27–34 kW) and was capable of propelling the car to a top speed of 81 mph (130 km/h). The lower-powered engine arrived in 1972; with milder cams and lowered compression it gave up some peak power and torque, while allowing for a less peaky delivery and higher drivability. It delivered surprisingly peppy performance because of its light weight (around 550 kg/1100 pounds), due to compact dimensions and some plastic parts (like the boot lid). The brakes on early models were very weak, despite having front discs and servo assistance. Rear suspension was a dead axle on leaf springs.\n\nThe N600 (along with the TN360 kei truck), were the first Honda cars to be assembled outside Japan, with production in Taiwan by local joint venture Sanyang Industrial beginning in 1969. The N600 was called the Fu Gui, meaning 'Wealth' in Chinese (富貴).\n\nUS sales stopped in 1972, as did those of the sportier Honda Z600 (or Z, depending on country), after about 25,000 sales of the N600. 40,550 Zs and Ns were sold altogether in the United States. The first-generation Honda Civic replaced the N models.\n\nSerial Number N600-1000001\n\nIn September 1967, Honda offered their first automobile for the North American market, and they were exported to Los Angeles, California. 50 pre-production left-hand-drive examples were sent as \"winter test vehicles\" and were only intended to be driven  for endurance testing, then collected and crushed at a local scrapyard across the street from the American Honda 1960s headquarters building at 100 West Alondra Boulevard. Four of the American pre-production vehicles still exist, and Serial Number N600-1000001, the first one manufactured, was discovered at a Japanese-specific car show in Long Beach, California, in 2015. At the request of American Honda, the car was extensively restored and unveiled at the same car show one year later, to be added to the American Honda Museum collection. As of 2018 the car has been added to the Petersen Automotive Museum collection. Honda documented the restoration in a series of videos:  here and  \"Serial One restoration\".\n\nLegacy\nHonda has paid tribute to the N360 with a number of modern vehicles, including:\nHonda EV-N concept, shown at Tokyo Motor Show 2009\nHonda N-One, introduced in 2012 as a modern kei-car homage to the N360\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n ThisOldHonda.org N360\n ThisOldHonda.org N600\n  Gainesville Sun 7 May 1982 \n Ocala Star Banner 7 October 1982\n Sarasota Herald Tribune 10 June 1979\n The Honda N600E - The Little Car That Opened the Roadway in America\n\nN360\nKei cars\nCars introduced in 1967\nCars introduced in 1970\nCars powered by 2-cylinder engines\nCars discontinued in 1972"}

Jadine is a beautiful Sorbonne graduate and fashion model who has been sponsored into wealth and privilege by the Streets, a wealthy white family who employ Jadine's aunt and uncle as domestic servants. Son is an impoverished, strong-minded man who washes up at the Streets' estate on a Caribbean island. As Jadine and Son come together, their affair ruptures the illusions and self-deceptions that held together the world and relationships at the estate.

Yet within the swift of her dazzlingly mythic/animistic fancies, and dialogue sharp as drum raps, they carry her speculations—about black and white relationships and black female identity—as lightly as racing silks. ... Scouring contemporary insights—in prose as lithe and potent as vines in a rain forest.\"\n\nIn The New York Times, novelist John Irving wrote of Tar Baby: \"...Toni Morrison's greatest accomplishment is that she has raised her novel above the social realism that too many black novels and women's novels are trapped in.

Unlike the first four games, Dragon Fire is primarily an action role-playing game with some elements of graphical adventure.\n\nGameplay\nDragon Fire retains its point-and-click graphical interface and introduces a new combat system. Previous entries had moved combat encounters to a separate, isolated combat screen, but Quest for Glory V'''s interface allows for these battles to take place in the same environment as the rest of the gameplay.Quest for Glory V provides more variety in the form of story paths, sidequests, and puzzles than its predecessors.\n\nPlot\nThe wizard Erasmus introduces the player character, the Hero, to the Greece-like kingdom of Silmaria, whose king was recently assassinated. Thus, the traditional Rites of Rulership are due to commence, and the victor will be crowned king. The Hero enters the contest with the assistance of Erasmus, Rakeesh, and many old friends from previous entries in the series. The Hero competes against competitors, including the Silmarian guard Kokeeno Pookameeso, the warlord Magnum Opus, the hulking Gort, and the warrior Elsa Von Spielburg, who played a significant role in the first game.\n\nAs the Rites commence, an unknown assassin begins systematically picking off the contestants. Each contestant is murdered by a poison dagger, and they all are murdered near Dragon Pillars, the objects used to keep the Dragon of Silmaria locked up. After completing the second Rite, defeating the General of the Mercenaries, Rakeesh is attacked by the assassin and, depending on the course of action chosen by the player, either lives or dies. The conspiracy is eventually unraveled and the Dragon, having been released due to the destruction of the Dragon Pillars, is defeated.\n\nThe characters Katrina and Erana make a return in this installment, as assistance for defeating the Dragon.\n\nThis installment also marks the return of Bruno, a character from the first Quest for Glory game. He is revealed to be the assassin who has been terrorizing the streets of Silmaria, characterized as a quiet, shady character until he reveals himself to the player.\n\nDevelopment\nThe first four games were intended to indicate the four elements and the four wind directions: in the first game, the player is the Hero from the East, in the second, the hero from the North, etc. Dragon Fire was always planned to be part of the series (whereas Wages of War originally was not), but it would not have been produced if not for fans' enthusiasm and their pleas to Sierra On-Line.\n\nThe game originally had a voxel engine, which was later changed to a 3D engine because of hardware limitations. According to Corey Cole, Lori Cole was predominantly responsible for the game's design, as he was preoccupied with programming on the game.\n\nBecause of deadline issues and financial pressures, several features were dropped from the fifth game before release, such as the ability to use a bow, the ability to play as Elsa von Spielburg or Magnum Opus (two prominent non-player characters from the game), and multiplayer capability. A demo released in late 1997 contained a multiplayer game, but Sierra decided to remove it from the final product. Yosemite Entertainment, the development team responsible for the game, was closed on February 22, 1999.\n\nThe fifth game is arguably a different genre from the first four; while the first four are mostly adventure games incorporating role-playing elements, the fifth game is a role-playing game incorporating some adventure elements. For instance, the fifth game has a wide variety of weapons, armor, and magical items, whereas the first four do not. Also, in the fifth game nearly every major mission consists of going to some place and defeating some monster in physical or magical combat. Additionally, the controls and battle system are substantially different from those of the first four games and different from the fourth's side-scrolling, fighting game-like combat as well.\n\nAlso differentiating the fifth game from the first four are a new graphics engine programmed by Eric Lengyel and a soundtrack by Emmy-winning composer Chance Thomas, which was released on CD. Some tracks were made available for free download from MP3.com.\n\nCompatibility\nThere is an official patch for the game itself, fixing several problems. To run this game under Windows XP, the compatibility mode can either be set to Windows 98 or a fan-made patch can be applied.\n\nThere is an official installer named \"New Quest for Glory V installer\". This installer allows the game to be played without a disc and on modern versions of Windows.\n\nRe-releaseThe Quest for Glory I–V Collection released by Activision through GOG.com includes all the games including QFG5 patched to run on modern Vista and Windows 7 PCs.\n\nReception\n\nChance Thomas' soundtrack was released alongside a demo prior to Dragon Fires launch. This product sold 50,000 copies and made $500,000 alone.\n\nThe game received mixed reactions from players, although \"critics tended to be kind to the game\". Next Generation summarized it as \"a fine contribution to the genre that is accessible to novice and expert gamers alike.\" Joshua Darien Maciel of RPGamer scored the game 9 out of 10 points, considering it a polished and seamless combination of combat and gameplay.Dragon Fire was a nominee for CNET Gamecenter's 1998 \"Adventure Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to Grim Fandango. The editors wrote, \"What Dragon Fire does really well is give traditional adventure gamers a place to call home.\"\n\nRetrospective\nG4TV's Adam Rosenberg considers Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire'' the best entry in the series. Griffin McElroy of Polygon positively characterised the game as \"fan service\" for fans of its predecessors. Rowan Kaizer of Engadget considers this entry the worst of the series, largely due to its use of primitive 3D graphics. Richard Cobbet of PC Gamer considers the game a \"stumble\" due to the game's 3D graphics and arcade action gameplay.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1998 video games\nAction role-playing video games\nClassic Mac OS games\nPoint-and-click adventure games\nQuest for Glory\nRole-playing video games\nSierra Entertainment games\nVideo games scored by Chance Thomas\nWindows games\nVideo games developed in the United States"}

{"id": "4106832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest%20for%20Glory%3A%20Shadows%20of%20Darkness", "title": "Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness", "text": "Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness is an adventure game/role-playing video game hybrid. It is the fourth installment of the Quest for Glory computer game series by Sierra On-Line. It was the first and only game of the series to drop the numerals from the title.\n\nPlot\n\nShadow of Darkness follows directly on the events of Quest for Glory III: Wages of War. Drawn without warning from victory in Fricana, the Hero arrives without equipment or explanation in the middle of the hazardous Dark One Caves in the distant land of Mordavia, a world full of undead that is \"a mix of Slavic folklore and Lovecraftian horror\". Upon escaping from the closing cave mouth, he meets a mysterious young woman named Katrina who assists him again several times in his journey. The Hero helps the townspeople with their problems. He encounters several old foes, including the not-quite-dead Ad Avis and the ogress Baba Yaga, and makes several bizarre new allies. The Hero is ultimately coerced into assisting Ad Avis' Dark Master in collecting the Dark Rituals that will allow Avoozl the Dark One (an obvious Cthulhu pastiche, and most likely a reference to the Slavic deity Chernobog) to manifest in Mordavia's world. Naturally, the Hero escapes this control and thwarts their plan, destroying Ad Avis in the process. During the celebration of the Hero's somewhat pyrrhic victory, the wizard Erasmus appears, along with his familiar Fenrus, summoning the Hero to the land of Silmaria.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay continued with Quest for Glory III'''s graphical, point-and-click interface, and also introduced a new combat system, which introduced a sideways perspective of the fights, and allowed players to check an option to let the computer fight the battles for them.\n\nDevelopmentQuest for Glory IV features darker themes while maintaining the humor of previous games through such methods as incorporating Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre parodies. Revolving around a dark cult summoning an unfathomably large evil, the game was a far cry from earlier villains such as Baba Yaga. Additionally, the undead and Lovecraftian monsters differed significantly from the lighter monsters of earlier games (there were, however, vampiric rabbits reminiscent of Monty Python and the Holy Grail). The game was inspired by gothic fiction, \"old horror movies and books about vampires and werewolves\".\n\nDevelopment for the game ran late, which forced Sierra to ship the game with inadequate testing. The first version of the game, which appears on floppy discs, is \"almost unplayable\"; however, the following year's re-release of the game on CD was much improved because a programmer had had a year to address the problems. The GOG digital re-release has since resolved many of the remaining bugs. According to one of the game's directors, Corey Cole, Quest for Glory IV was developed with a budget of $750,000.\n\nA particularly detailed sequence in the game involved the Gypsy Magda gathering information about the hero's future and his possible enemies or allies using a deck of Tarot cards. The images used for the game were taken from the Russian Tarot of St. Petersburg, a Rider-Waite-Smith clone deck, and the layout used appears to be unique to the game, though it is partially akin to the beginning of a Celtic cross layout.Shadows of Darkness was developed with SVGA graphics.\n\nThe CD-ROM version of Quest for Glory IV is the first game in the series to feature voice actors. The most notable voice actors for the game are John Rhys-Davies as the Narrator, Jennifer Hale as Katrina, and Bill Farmer as Leshy. Additionally, the game featured a largely original sound track by Aubrey Hodges – although it did feature a reprise of the Hero's Theme from previous games and a rendition of \"Anitra's Dance\" by Edvard Grieg which played as background music in the Hotel Mordavia.\n\nAccording to an InterAction magazine article, John Rhys-Davies' part took more than three weeks to record, causing him to refer to the game as the \"CD-ROM from Hell\". Quest for Glory IV was the first video game in which Jennifer Hale voiced dialogue. The dub of a trio of local farmers is conspicuous for its emphasis on quips and banter, and its indifference to what actually reads on their text boxes.\n\nThe end of Quest for Glory III referred to the game as Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness. The original manuals for the game referred to the game simply as Quest for Glory: Shadows of Darkness. It was later called Quest for Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness in the Quest for Glory Anthology collection manual. Quest for Glory II referred to it as Quest For Glory III: Shadows of Darkness.\n\nRelease\nInitially, the game was released in December 1993 on nine 3.5\" floppy diskettes (as were many other Sierra adventures at the time) to accommodate gamers who didn't have a CD-ROM drive. Pressure to adorn shelves before the holiday season marred the first release with bugs that frustrated the earliest players. Other factors were that the game was ambitious in scope and complex in design compared to other adventures, and Sierra's adventure game technology, the SCI engine, had been undergoing significant revisions during development. Sierra later shipped a version 1.1a patch that  was completed on January 10, 1994, free of charge, to customers who requested it. This game was among the first few published games shipped with known software bugs that the publisher planned to later rectify by providing a patch. Fortunately, the main release soon followed. Appearing in September 1994, this finalized CD version brought full recorded dialogue, a new intro cinematic, and fixed gameplay. The jewel box came with a game CD, manual, store catalogue, and legalities. The floppy version came with a smaller and less detailed manual.\n\nAs the floppy version had no device-entrusted copyright protection, the player was asked to make several verifications at the beginning of each game. The CD version only required the disc.\n\nReceptionComputer Gaming World said in March 1994, \"Offering a unique mix of dark mystery and light humor, Shadows of Darkness is another award winning adventure\". The magazine's Scorpia in April 1994 was less positive. She liked the game's automatic combat option for \"those like myself who despise arcade action in adventure games\" but disliked the \"weak to obscure\" puzzles and described the end boss as \"a letdown\". Scorpia especially criticized its bugs, describing the game as perhaps \"the sloppiest product ever released by Sierra\" and requiring multiple patches and \"numerous replays\". She reported that the game's premature release for \"'financial reasons'\" had hurt Sierra's \"reputation for releasing solid products\", and hoped that \"this is a one-time event and that Sierra is not going to join the ranks of other companies—too numerous to mention—who release shoddy product knowing they can get by with patches and upgrades, and who make pay-testers of their customers\", but concluded that \"Shadows of Darkness was a disappointment\".\n\nRowan Kaizer of Engadget and Ryan Stevens of GameTrailers consider it the best entry of the entire series.  Michael Baker for RPGamer considers the installment a good game \"worth money even twenty years on\", scoring it 4 out of 5 stars. Adam Rosenberg of G4TV considers Shadows of Darkness \"the most elaborate and well-designed\" entry in the series. PC Gamer's Richard Cobbett considers the game \"absolutely wonderful\". In 2011, Adventure Gamers named Shadows of Darkness'' the 23rd-best adventure game ever released.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1993 video games\nAdventure games\nDOS games\nGames commercially released with DOSBox\nPoint-and-click adventure games\nQuest for Glory\nScummVM-supported games\nSierra Entertainment games\nVideo games based on Slavic mythology\nVideo games scored by Aubrey Hodges\nWindows games\nVideo games developed in the United States\nSingle-player video games"}

Schwartz (born June 2, 1966) is an American football coach who is the defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He was head coach of the Detroit Lions from 2009 to 2013. He was also defensive coordinator for the Tennessee Titans from 2001 to 2008, Buffalo Bills in 2014, and Philadelphia Eagles from 2016 to 2020. In addition, Schwartz was the Senior Defensive Assistant for the Titans from 2021 to 2022. He won Super Bowl LII with the Eagles in 2018.\n\nAs a defensive-minded coach that emphasized strong defensive line play, Schwartz was known to build his units around a dominant interior lineman. A majority of his stints as head coach or defensive coordinator resulted in at least one of his defensive tackles being named to the All-Pro First Team and Pro Bowl: Albert Haynesworth in Tennessee, Ndamukong Suh in Detroit, Marcell Dareus in Buffalo and Fletcher Cox in Philadelphia.\n\nEarly life\nSchwartz was born just outside Baltimore, Maryland, and attended Mount Saint Joseph High School, an all-male Catholic school, where he played football. Schwartz was a four-year letterman at linebacker for the Hoyas of Georgetown University, where he earned his degree in economics. He received Distinguished Economics Graduate honors at Georgetown and earned numerous honors in 1988, including Division III CoSIDA/GTE Academic All-America, All-America, and team captain.\n\nCoaching career\n\nEarly coaching career\nSchwartz got his start in the NFL doing research for Bill Belichick on the Cleveland Browns staff in the mid-1990s. Schwartz served as the Tennessee Titans' defensive coordinator from 2001–2008. During his time with Tennessee, Schwartz was considered for several different NFL head coaching openings. He was a candidate for the San Francisco 49ers' head coaching position in 2005, but the job went to Mike Nolan. In January 2008, he interviewed for head coaching positions with the Washington Redskins, Miami Dolphins  and Atlanta Falcons. Adam Schefter reported on January 15, 2009 that the Detroit Lions had decided to hire Schwartz as head coach. Defensive tackle Albert Haynesworth, who Schwartz led to stardom in Tennessee, would later call the coordinator a \"mastermind\" due to the success he found in his defensive schemes.\n\nDetroit Lions\nThe 2009 season was Schwartz's first as Detroit's head coach and he posted a 2–14 record, with victories coming against the Washington Redskins and the Cleveland Browns.\n\nIn 2010, Schwartz saw his Lions begin the season with a 2–10 record, but they finished with four consecutive wins against the Green Bay Packers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Miami Dolphins, and Minnesota Vikings.\n\nIn 2011, the Lions returned to the postseason for the first time since 1999, clinching a playoff berth following a 38–10 victory over the San Diego Chargers. Detroit would go on to be eliminated in the first round by the New Orleans Saints.\n\nThe Lions started the 2012 season with a 4–4 record, but they then dropped their final eight games to end the year at 4–12. They finished in last place in the NFC North, as every other division member won at least ten games. Following the season, Schwartz and his staff led the South Team to a 21–16 triumph in the 2013 Senior Bowl.\n\nThe Lions started the 2013 season with a 6–3 record and gained control of the NFC North, the Lions proceeded to drop six of their next seven games to end the year at 7–9. Schwartz was fired on December 30, 2013, following five seasons as head coach.\n\nBuffalo Bills\nOn January 24, 2014, Schwartz was hired by the Buffalo Bills as the defensive coordinator. Schwartz's defense was one of the top defenses statistically in the NFL, and led the league in sacks. During the 2014 season, the Bills went 4–0 against NFC North opponents, which Schwartz had coached against for the previous five seasons. On October 5, 2014, the Bills defeated Schwartz's former team, the Detroit Lions, by a final score of 17–14, in Detroit. Schwartz was carried off the field by his players after the game. Some Lions players, especially Golden Tate, were upset by Schwartz's decision to be carried off the field against his former team. The Bills ended the season fourth in the NFL in points and yards allowed per game with 18.1 and 312.2, respectively, while ranking third in takeaways with 30. The Bills also finished with their first winning record in ten years at 9–7, with defensive linemen Kyle Williams, Marcell Dareus and Mario Williams being named to the Pro Bowl and the latter two being named First-Team All-Pro. Despite the success, head coach Doug Marrone resigned at the end of the season and new Bills coach Rex Ryan decided to bring in his own personnel, rather than retaining Schwartz.\n\n2015 season\nFor the 2015 season, Schwartz took a consulting position with the NFL's officiating department to provide a coach's perspective on officiating decisions. On October 6, Schwartz declined the opportunity to replace Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nOn January 19, 2016, Schwartz was hired by the Philadelphia Eagles to be their defensive coordinator under coach Doug Pederson. Inheriting one of the league's worst defenses, Schwartz made an immediate impact. Implementing his 4-3 defense, Schwartz turned around the defense that previously ranked 30th in yards allowed and 28th in points allowed to 13th and 12th in his first season and fourth in both categories during his second. He would eventually lead the defense to his and the Eagles' first Super Bowl championship in Super Bowl LII. On January 7, 2021, Schwartz announced that he was going to step away from coaching due to health issues and resigned from the Eagles.\n\nReturn to Tennessee\nSchwartz was hired by the Tennessee Titans as a senior defensive assistant on April 7, 2021.\n\nCleveland Browns\nOn January 18, 2023, Schwartz was hired by the Cleveland Browns as the defensive coordinator.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nPersonal life\nSchwartz and his wife, Kathy, have twins Christian and Alison, along with a younger daughter, Maria.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Detroit Lions Profile\nBuffalo Bills profile\nPhiladelphia Eagles Profile\n\n1966 births\nLiving people\nBaltimore Ravens coaches\nBuffalo Bills coaches\nCleveland Browns coaches\nDetroit Lions head coaches\nGeorgetown University alumni\nGeorgetown Hoyas football players\nMaryland Terrapins football coaches\nMinnesota Golden Gophers football coaches\nNational Football League defensive coordinators\nPhiladelphia Eagles coaches\nTennessee Titans coaches"}

It has been developed by McGill University in Montreal by the Stormy Weather Group to circumvent some problems with the PPI:\n\n Altitude changing with distance to the radar.\n Ground echoes problems near the radar.\n\nDefinition and history \n\nIn 1954, McGill University obtained a new radar (CPS-9) which had a better resolution and used FASE (Fast Azimuth Slow Elevation) to program multi-angle soundings of the atmosphere.\n\nIn 1957, Langleben and Gaherty developed a scheme with FASE to keep only the data at a certain height at each angle and scan on 360 degrees. If we look at the diagram, each angle of elevation or PPI has data at height X at a certain distance from the radar. Using the data at the right distance, one forms an annular ring of data at height X. Assembling all the rings coming from the different angles gives you the CAPPI.\n\nThe CAPPI is composed of data from each angle that is at the height requested for the cross-section (bold lines in zig-zag on the left diagram). In the early days, the scan data collected where shown directly on the cathodic screen and a photo sensitive device captured each ring as it was completed. Then all those photographed rings were assembled. By 1958, East developed a real time assembly instead of a delayed one. By the mid-1970s, computer developments made it possible to gather data in electronic form and make CAPPIs more easily.\n\nToday, weather radars collect in real-time data on a large number of angles. Many countries such as Canada, UK and Australia, scan a large enough number of angles with their radars to have an almost continuous vertical view (taking into account the radar beam width) and produce CAPPIs. Other countries, like France and United States, use fewer angles and prefer PPIs or composite of maximum reflectivities above a point.\n\nUsage \nAbove right is an example of a CAPPI at 1.5 km altitude. Looking at the diagram of angles, that depending on the height of the CAPPI, there comes a distance where no data is available. The portion beyond this distance on a CAPPI is then showing data from the lowest PPI. The higher is the CAPPI above ground, the smaller is that PPI zone.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n David Atlas, Radar in Meteorology: Battan Memorial and 40th Anniversary Radar Meteorology Conference, published by American Meteorological Society, Boston, 1990, 806 pages, , AMS Code RADMET.\n Yves Blanchard, Le radar, 1904–2004: histoire d'un siècle d'innovations techniques et opérationnelles , published by Ellipses, Paris, France, 2004 \n R.

{"id": "4106885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafslo", "title": "Hafslo", "text": "Hafslo is a former municipality in the old Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway.  The  municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1963. It is located in the present-day Luster Municipality (in Vestland county) in the traditional district of Sogn. The former municipality included the villages of Kinsedalen, Ornes, and Kroken on the east side of the Lustrafjorden.  It also included the villages of Solvorn, Hafslo, Joranger, and the whole Veitastrond valley on the west side of the Lustrafjorden.  The municipality surrounded the lakes Hafslovatnet and Veitastrondvatnet.  The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Hafslo, where Hafslo Church was located.\n\nHistory\nHafslo was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1963, the municipality of Hafslo (population: 2,384) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Luster (population: 2,674) and Jostedal (population: 796) to form the new, larger municipality of Luster.\n\nName\nThe municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Hafslo farm () since the first Hafslo Church was built there. The first element is the old male name , the name is identical with the word  which means \"male goat\". The last element is  which means \"clearing\" or \"meadow\", probably due to the excellent farming areas nearby.\n\nGovernment\nDuring its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.\n\nMayors\nThe mayors of Hafslo:\n\n1838-1839: Ola Trondsen Lid\n1840-1859: Einar Joranger\n1860-1860: Samuel M.

In 1927, Dallas County Schools had acquired  of land for $900 upon which to build Pinkerton Elementary, the only campus to serve Coppell children attending kindergarten through the eighth grade. At that time, the total number of students in grades K-8 was about 175.\n\nUntil the first high school was built, at what is currently the site for Coppell Middle School West, Coppell students wishing to complete their 9th-12th grade high school education did so in Grapevine. The additional four grades were phased-in beginning with the 9th grade which was added in 1961, then 10th in 1962, 11th in 1963, and the 12th grade was added in 1964. Over the years, Coppell has remained a one high school community where Coppell High School's mascot was the \"Lions.\" Once the newly formed professional football team located nearby, the mascot was changed to the Coppell \"Cowboys\" and has remained so ever since.\n\nStudent growth in the district averaged over 16% from the mid-eighties through the late nineties. Today, as the largest employer in Coppell with over 1200 employees, Coppell ISD has fifteen campuses serving nearly 10,000 students in grades K-12 including ten at the elementary level, three middle schools, two high school, and an alternative campus. The CISD has opened a new technically oriented high school, called New Tech High @ Coppell, in the fall of 2008.\n\nCoppell is ranked twelfth among \"The Best Places to Live in Dallas\" with mean SAT scores earning them third place among 62 suburbs (D Magazine 7/06).\n\nCoppell ISD is ranked #1 in school districts in Texas over 10,000 students for Gold Performance Acknowledgments (GPAs) in 2006.

{"id": "4106919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland%20Route%20193", "title": "Maryland Route 193", "text": "Maryland Route 193 (MD 193) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Known for most of its length as University Boulevard and Greenbelt Road, the state highway runs  from MD 185 in Kensington east to MD 202 north of Upper Marlboro.  MD 193 serves as a major east-west commuter route in eastern Montgomery County and northern Prince George's County, connecting Wheaton, Silver Spring, Langley Park, College Park, and Greenbelt.  The state highway also provides the primary access to the University of Maryland and Goddard Space Flight Center.  In central Prince George's County, MD 193 is the main north–south highway connecting Glenn Dale and Greater Upper Marlboro with the affluent suburbs of Woodmore and Kettering.\n\nMD 193 originally consisted of Connecticut Avenue between Chevy Chase and Kensington and Old Bladensburg Road (now University Boulevard) between Kensington and College Park.  While MD 185 replaced MD 193 on the Connecticut Avenue portion in the 1970s, MD 193 grew on its eastern end by taking over the routing of MD 430 between College Park and Greenbelt and MD 199 in Glenn Dale in the early 1960s.  MD 193 reached its final extent by taking over MD 556 between Glenn Dale and Greater Upper Marlboro in the late 1980s.  The state highway's expansion from a two-lane road to a divided highway with four to six lanes began in the 1950s and continued through the 1990s.\n\nRoute description\nMD 193 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from its western terminus in Kensington east to MD 450 near Glenn Dale.\n\nMontgomery County\n\nMD 193 begins at an acute intersection with MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue) in Kensington.  There is no access between southbound MD 185 and eastbound MD 193, as well as between westbound MD 193 and northbound MD 185; those movements use Perry Avenue.  The state highway, named University Boulevard, heads northeast as a six-lane divided highway through a commercial area.  After leaving the town limits of Kensington, MD 193 passes through a mix of apartment complexes and single family homes. The state highway enters the commercial district of Wheaton, where the road passes the Westfield Wheaton shopping mall and intersects MD 586 (Veirs Mill Road).  MD 586 south is used to access the Wheaton station along Washington Metro's Red Line.  MD 193 continues east through the commercial area to meet MD 97 (Georgia Avenue).  There are no left turns allowed from MD 193 to MD 97; instead, the eastbound and westbound directions use Grandview Avenue and Amherst Avenue, respectively, to complete the missing movements.\n\nAfter passing the WTOP-FM radio transmitter, MD 193 heads southeast through suburban residential areas.  The state highway descends into the valley of Sligo Creek, where the highway meets the northern end of Sligo Creek Parkway and crosses the Sligo Creek Trail.  MD 193 passes a cluster of high-rise apartment buildings and Northwood High School around the intersection with Arcola Avenue and turns south, passing Dennis Avenue.  MD 193 splits into a one-way pair upon entering the Four Corners commercial area, where the highway intersects U.S. Route 29 (US 29) and passes Montgomery Blair High School.  The state highway then meets Interstate 495 (I-495, Capital Beltway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange that is missing the movements between I-495 east and MD 193 west and between MD 193 east and I-495 west.  The missing movements are completed by using US 29 south of Four Corners.  After crossing the Capital Beltway, MD 193 continues south through residential suburban areas of Silver Spring, intersecting East Franklin Avenue.  After meeting MD 320 and passing Quebec Terrace Park, the state highway turns southeast and enters an area of garden apartments and duplexes.  After crossing MD 195 at an oblique angle, MD 193 enters Prince George's County.\n\nPrince George's County\n\nMD 193 continues east into Langley Park, an area with multiple shopping centers, garden apartments, and heavy pedestrian cross-traffic.  MD 193 meets MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) at Takoma-Langley Crossroads, an intersection with a shopping center on all four corners and the Takoma Langley Crossroads Transit Center located at the northwest corner. The state highway continues straight southeast toward its junction with MD 212, where MD 193 turns east.  After passing Lane Manor Recreation Center, the state highway leaves the commercial area and crosses Northwest Branch.  Here the highway reduces to four lanes.  MD 193 continues east through a forested area toward College Park.  Campus Drive continues straight toward the University of Maryland campus as well as University of Maryland Global Campus, while MD 193 veers left and intersects Adelphi Road.  Movements between MD 193 east and Adelphi Road south are made via Campus Drive.  After passing Adelphi Road, the state highway heads northeast past the intersection with Stadium Drive, which is used to access Maryland Stadium and the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center.  After turning east again, MD 193 intersects Paint Branch Drive, which serves the Xfinity Center arena.  The state highway passes Paint Branch Golf Course and crosses Paint Branch, after which the highway intersects US 1 at a partial interchange.  The missing movements are made via a right-in/right-out interchange on the eastbound side just to the east of the partial interchange, and through Greenbelt Road (unsigned MD 430) just to the east of Rhode Island Avenue, which has a westbound at-grade exit and eastbound entrance.\n\nAfter passing Greenbelt Road, MD 193 expands to six lanes and its name changes to Greenbelt Road. The state highway crosses CSX's Capital Subdivision railroad line, MARC's Camden Line, and the Green Line of the Washington Metro and Indian Creek, then enters a commercial area as the highway straddles the northern boundary of Berwyn Heights.  After passing Cherrywood Drive, which leads to the Greenbelt Metro station, MD 193 passes Beltway Plaza shopping mall.  The state highway then meets MD 201 (Kenilworth Avenue) at a diamond interchange.  MD 193 continues east into Greenbelt as an eight-lane divided highway past Greenbelt Park until right before passing under the Capital Beltway, where the right lane eastbound exits for the southbound Baltimore-Washington Parkway.  Both directions of MD 193 access the southbound parkway via Southway, which heads north into the Greenbelt Historic District.  After crossing the parkway, MD 193 has an intersection with the northbound ramps to the parkway. After passing south of Eleanor Roosevelt High School, the road reduces to four lanes and the state highway passes a series of apartment complexes on the south and the campus of Goddard Space Flight Center on the north.  Beyond Goddard, MD 193 heads north of DuVal High School before it crosses Good Luck Road. The road passes some more apartments and shopping centers in Glenn Dale before meeting MD 564 (Lanham Severn Road).\n\nMD 193 heads southeast from MD 564 as Glenn Dale Boulevard, a four-lane divided highway with a wide median through scattered residential subdivisions.  The state highway immediately crosses Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad line and MARC's Penn Line as well as Folly Branch.  MD 193 passes Marietta, a historic home and museum, before its intersection with MD 450 (Annapolis Road), where the name of the highway changes to Enterprise Road.  Beyond MD 450, the state highway slims down to two lanes and passes through residential subdivisions.  After an intersection with the old alignment, MD 953 (Glenn Dale Road), MD 193 temporarily becomes a divided highway as it passes under the US 50 freeway.  The state highway enters the affluent suburb of Woodmore, where it passes the Country Club at Woodmore and Enterprise Golf Course, which features the Newton White Mansion, before intersecting Lottsford Road and Woodmore Road.  MD 193 continues south and temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway prior to crossing the Northeast Branch of the Western Branch of the Patuxent River and meeting MD 214 (Central Avenue) in Kettering.  Beyond MD 214, the state highway becomes a two-lane undivided road and changes its name to Watkins Park Drive.  MD 193 passes Watkins Regional Park and First Baptist Church of Glenarden before encountering Oak Grove Drive at a roundabout.  From there, the state highway turns southwest and meets its eastern terminus at MD 202 (Largo Road) at the boundary between the census-designated places of Kettering and Brock Hall.\n\nHistory\nMD 193 originally consisted of two named portions, Connecticut Avenue from Chevy Chase to Kensington and University Lane from Kensington to College Park.  The Connecticut Avenue segment is now MD 185; that portion's history is covered in more detail in the Maryland Route 185 article.  University Lane was paved from Kensington to Wheaton and from Four Corners to MD 320 in Silver Spring by 1927.  The pavement extended from MD 320 to MD 212 in 1930; the segment of road on the University of Maryland campus was also paved.  By 1933, MD 193 was fully paved from Kensington to US 1 in College Park when the portion between MD 212 and the university was completed on a new alignment.\n\nThe roads over which MD 193 would later be extended east consisted of three state highways:\nMD 430 (Greenbelt Road) was completed on a new alignment in 1942 between US 1 in College Park and MD 205 (now MD 201) in Greenbelt.  Greenbelt Road continued east as a county-maintained highway towards Glenn Dale.\nMD 199 (Glenn Dale Road) was paved from US 50 (now MD 450) north to the Penn Line in 1927.  The MD 199 designation was extended north to MD 564 in 1950, then removed from the entire road in 1954.\nMD 556 (Enterprise Road) was paved from MD 214 north to near Woodmore Road in 1933.  A second segment of MD 556 was signed from US 50 south to the present intersection of MD 193 and MD 953 by 1939.  The two segments were connected by a county-maintained segment that was brought under state control by 1946.  MD 556 was extended south along Enterprise Road to MD 202 in 1955.\n\nThe four-lane divided bypass of the University of Maryland was started by 1955 and completed in 1956.  At that time, MD 193 turned south at the right-in/right-out ramps just east of the US 1 overpass to a right angle intersection with MD 430.  The four-lane divided highway was extended west from College Park in stages, reaching MD 650 in 1957, Franklin Avenue (then MD 516) in 1959, US 29 in Four Corners in 1960, and Kensington in the early 1960s.  MD 193's western terminus was moved from Chevy Chase to Kensington in the 1970s.  MD 193 was expanded to six lanes between Kensington and Langley Park beginning in 1972.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1964, MD 193 was extended east as a four-lane divided highway from College Park along MD 430 and the remainder of Greenbelt Road to Glenn Dale.  The state highway then headed south along Glenn Dale Road (former MD 199) to MD 450, then south along the part of Glenn Dale Road that had never been state-maintained to an intersection with MD 556 just north of the US 50 freeway. MD 193 was expanded to six lanes between MD 430 and just east of MD 201 in 1988, when the MD 201 interchange was completed.  The six lane section was extended to the east edge of Greenbelt in 1994.\n\nGlenn Dale Boulevard, a four-lane divided highway, was finished in 1986 when its bridge over the Penn Line was completed, replacing a grade crossing at Glenn Dale Road.  Glenn Dale Boulevard extended south to the intersection of MD 450 and MD 556.  MD 193 was extended south on Glenn Dale Boulevard then replaced MD 556 on Enterprise Road south to MD 214.  Finally, Watkins Park Drive was built in 1988 on a new alignment, replacing Enterprise Road south of MD 214.  MD 193 was extended along Watkins Park Drive and replaced the remaining segment of MD 556.\n\nJunction list\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n MDRoads: MD 193\n\n193\nMaryland Route 193\nMaryland Route 193"}

From 1857 until his death, Holmes taught literature, history and political economy at the University of Virginia and became known for textbooks designed for use in schools in the southern United States.\n\nEarly life and education\nGeorge Frederick Holmes was born in 1820 in British Guyana, either in its capital Georgetown or the surrounding Demerera region. In 1836, he attended the University of Durham in England, but left for Quebec in 1837 without taking a degree.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1838, Holmes emigrated to the United States and taught in Caroline County, Virginia. He moved to Macon, Georgia, where in addition to teaching, he began to study law. In 1840, Holmes moved to South Carolina where he taught first in Walterboro, then in Orangeburg. Holmes also continued to study law and was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1842, but did not practice as a lawyer for any significant period. Instead, he resumed his teaching career.\n\nIn 1845, Holmes became a professor of Ancient Languages at Richmond College, now known as the University of Richmond. In 1847, Holmes became Professor of History and Political Economy at the College of William and Mary.\n\nHolmes then moved to Mississippi and from 1848 to 1849 taught and served as the first President of the University of Mississippi.\n\nIn 1857, Holmes returned to Virginia as professor of history and general literature at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.  He wrote in opposition Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1858. In 1860, he owned one enslaved 12 year old Black boy.\nIn 1882, years after the American Civil War and after creating a school of English language and literature, the University of Virginia reduced Holmes' teaching duties, relieving him of literature courses, so he only taught history and political economy. In 1889 Holmes was appointed an adjunct professor of history, and taught classes in political economy and the science of society. He also privately printed his lectures on the science of society.\nThe Southern Quarterly Review, the Southern Literary Messenger, DeBow's Review, and the Methodist Quarterly Review published articles Holmes wrote. He corresponded with Auguste Comte and John C. Calhoun. He supported state rights, African-American slavery, and an end to tariffs.\n\nPersonal life\nHolmes married Virginian Lavalette Holmes and they had at least two sons (Henry born 1855 and Frederick born 1858) as well as three daughters (Mary Ann born 1846, Letticia born 1849 and Isabella born 1856).\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nHolmes died in Charlottesville in 1897.\n\nBooks written by G.F.

He most recently was the senior offensive advisor for the  Minnesota Vikings. He was the offensive line coach and run game coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL) from 2019-2020. An assistant in the NFL since 1995, he served as offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos (2006–2008, 2015-2016), Houston Texans (2010–2013), and Buffalo Bills (2017), and served as quarterbacks coach for the Baltimore Ravens in 2014. He was the special teams coach for the Super Bowl Champion Broncos in 1997 and 1998. A linebacker who spent his entire NFL playing career in Denver from 1982 to 1990, he appeared in Super Bowls XXI, XXII, and XXIV.\n\nEarly years\nDennison was born in Kalispell, Montana, on June 22, 1958. His father George was the 16th President of The University of Montana from 1990 to 2010. The younger Dennison starred in football, baseball, and basketball at Rocky Mountain High School where he graduated in 1976.\n\nPlaying career\n\nCollege\nDennison attended Colorado State University where he was a football letterman for the Rams in 1976, 1978 and 1979. Wearing uniform number 83 and primarily a tight end for head coach Sark Arslanian, Dennison also saw some action as a wide receiver. He was both a second-team Academic All-American and the recipient of the Merrill-Gheen Award as the university's most outstanding male scholar-athlete in his senior year. He earned a bachelor's and master's degree, both in civil engineering, in 1980 and 1982 respectively.\n\nNational Football League\nDennison moved to linebacker when he entered the NFL. He played for the Denver Broncos from 1982 to 1990.\n\nCoaching career\n\nEarly career\nDuring a year off in 1993 for personal reasons, \"Rico\" assisted Suffield Academy in a successful New England football championship.\n\nDenver Broncos\nDennison began his coaching career as an offensive assistant for the Denver Broncos in 1995 and would serve in this role until 1996. In 1997, Dennison was promoted to special teams coordinator and would serve in this role for four seasons. In 2001, Dennison shifted to the offensive line coach of the Broncos. In 2006, Dennison was promoted to offensive coordinator of the Broncos and would serve in this role from 2006 to 2008.\n\nHouston Texans\nIn 2010, Dennison was hired by the Houston Texans as their offensive coordinator and served in this position from 2010 to 2013. Dennison's move to Houston reunited him with Texans head coach Gary Kubiak, who was a teammate of his in Denver between 1983 and 1990 and a fellow Broncos assistant coach between 1995 and 2005, and who he succeeded as Broncos offensive coordinator in 2006. On January 6, 2013, the Chicago Bears announced that they would interview Dennison for their head coaching position.\n\nBaltimore Ravens\nBoth Dennison and Kubiak were appointed quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator respectively of the Baltimore Ravens on January 27, 2014.\n\nDenver Broncos (second stint)\nIn January 2015, Dennison returned to the position of offensive coordinator with the Broncos following the hiring of Kubiak as head coach. On February 7, 2016, Dennison was part of the Broncos coaching staff that won Super Bowl 50. In the game, the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers by a score of 24–10.\n\nAfter the retirement of Kubiak following the 2016 season, Dennison was replaced by former San Diego Chargers head coach Mike McCoy as the Broncos' offensive coordinator.\n\nBuffalo Bills\nOn January 19, 2017, he was hired by the Buffalo Bills to serve on Sean McDermott's staff as offensive coordinator. On January 12, 2018, Dennison was relieved of duty as offensive coordinator after one season that saw the Bills offense finish 29th overall despite making the postseason.\n\nNew York Jets\nOn January 27, 2018, Dennison was hired by the New York Jets as their offensive line coach and run game coordinator under head coach Todd Bowles.\n\nMinnesota Vikings\nOn February 8, 2019, Dennison was hired by the Minnesota Vikings as their offensive line coach and run game coordinator under head coach Mike Zimmer, replacing Clancy Barone and Andrew Janocko, who took over in place of Tony Sparano, who died prior to the 2018 season. In 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic Dennison refused to take a vaccine and was promoted to a different job. Rick now serves as the Minnesota Vikings senior offensive advisor. The reason for this promotion was because it will follow COVID-19 protocols, because of being able to avoid contact with players.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Minnesota Vikings profile\n\n Football Database Stats\n Houston Chronicle reports Dennison joining the Texans\n\n1958 births\nLiving people\nAmerican football linebackers\nAmerican football tight ends\nBaltimore Ravens coaches\nBuffalo Bills coaches\nColorado State Rams football players\nDenver Broncos coaches\nDenver Broncos players\nHouston Texans coaches\nMinnesota Vikings coaches\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nNew York Jets coaches\nPeople from Kalispell, Montana\nRocky Mountain High School (Colorado) alumni"}
{"id": "4106955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International%20Bruckner%20Society", "title": "International Bruckner Society", "text": "The International Bruckner Society (German Internationale Bruckner-Gesellschaft) was an organization which began its existence in 1927 in Leipzig and was officially founded in 1929 in Vienna.  Its main purpose since then has been to publish editions of the music of Anton Bruckner.  Most of Bruckner's music had been published during the composer's lifetime or shortly after his death, but often in versions that incorporated numerous changes suggested by his friends and students.  In the case of Bruckner's unfinished Ninth Symphony, Bruckner student Ferdinand Loewe made several unauthorized changes even after Bruckner's death.  The mission of the International Bruckner Society was to publish versions of Bruckner's works based directly on the original manuscripts, which the composer had bequeathed to the Austrian National Library.\n\nThe Society hired Robert Haas as General Editor, with Alfred Orel as his assistant.  The first publication was Orel's critical edition of the Ninth Symphony, published in 1934 but premiered two years earlier in 1932 in a concert by Siegmund von Hausegger conducting the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra.  In this concert the Ninth Symphony was performed twice: once in the Loewe edition and again in the new Orel edition, and its success provided much impetus for a complete critical edition of Bruckner's work.\n\nBetween 1935 and 1944 Haas published editions of all the remaining numbered symphonies except for the Third (Haas's work on this symphony was destroyed in a wartime incident).  In several cases, multiple revisions of a single symphony existed in the manuscripts, and Haas did not hesitate to combine material from different versions to produce what he considered an \"ideal\" version for publication (even though it did not correspond to anything actually written by the composer).\n\nThe Society had officially been dissolved in 1938 immediately after the Anschluss (although publication of the complete edition continued from Leipzig).  After World War II the Society was refounded in Vienna.  Haas was fired because of his Nazi connections and publication resumed under a new General Editor: Leopold Nowak.  The first post-war publication was a critical edition of the Third Symphony, edited by Fritz Oeser.  Nowak continued as General Editor until 1989, by which time the Society had published multiple versions of the symphonies and also numerous other works by Bruckner.  Nowak was a more scholarly and less creative editor than Haas:  he saw his task as reproducing all the different versions that Bruckner wrote on the basis of the manuscript and printed sources, and documenting all the differences in great detail.  The post-war Nowak editions became more commonly performed and recorded than the pre-war Haas versions, although a significant number of conductors continued to prefer Haas.\n\nThe Society continued to produce new editions of Bruckner's works after Nowak stepped down.  It also sponsors periodicals and scholarship dedicated to Bruckner.\n\nExternal links\nThe International Bruckner Society (PDF)\nThe Bruckner Complete Critical Edition\n Anton Bruckner Gesamtausgabe\n The International Bruckner Society and the N.S.D.A.P.: A Case Study of Robert Haas and the Critical Edition (summary of an article viewing Haas's work in the context of Nazism)\n\nAnton Bruckner\nOrganizations established in 1927\nCulture in Vienna\n1927 establishments in Germany"}

Possessing a powerful strike, he scored a total of 5 goals. He notably played in the Premier League for Manchester City and spent 6 years there during a turbulent period or relegations and promotions, including the 1999 Division 2 playoff final against Gillingham. He went on to play for Barnsley, Bradford City, Rochdale, as well as loan spells at Northampton Town and Notts County. He later had spells with non-league sides Guiseley and Ossett Town.\n\nAt age 32 he embarked on a new career in the British Armed Forces, joining the RAF Regiment, the infantry unit of the Royal Air Force.\n\nEarly life\nCrooks was born on 14 January 1978 in the city of Wakefield in West Yorkshire, England.\n\nFootball career\n\nManchester City\nCrooks was a product of the youth system at Manchester City. He also played for the England national football team at school level.As a club trainee, Crooks signed his first professional contract  on 1 August 1994 (aged 16 years, 6 months, 18 days). By September 1996 he was being included in the first team squad for games by caretaker manager Asa Hartford as one of three promising youngsters.\n\nCity were relegated to Division 1 at the end of the 1995–96 season, and two years later, again, falling to Division 2, their lowest ever level. Through two successive promotions however, via the play-offs from Division 2 and then by automatic promotion from Division 1, the club had returned to the Premier League in the minimum time just 2 years later, in time for the start of the 2000–01 season.\n\nCrooks was in the Manchester City team that won that 1999 Division 2 play off final at Wembley Stadium against Gillingham in dramatic fashion, albeit substituted on 85 minutes for Gareth Taylor. Having come back from a 2–0 deficit with 2 minutes remaining, City scored twice to take the game into extra time, and then after no further scores, winning the subsequent penalty shootout.\n\nOn 26 December 2000 he went out on loan to Northampton Town. He made 3 appearances before returning on 23 January 2001. On 7 March 2001 Crooks was sold by City to Barnsley for £190,000.\n\nCrooks scored two goals for Manchester City, both in the league. It was three years before he scored his first goal, an equaliser against Chesterfield in an away game on 27 February 1999, which ended 1–1.\n\nBarnsley\nCrooks didn't make his debut until the start of the 2001–02 season, being delayed for several months as he had operations on an injured medial collateral ligament.\n\nWith new manager Paul Hart performing a summer clear out after the 2003–04 season, Crooks was given the chance to prove his fitness during the summer in order to earn a new contract. He was released by Barnsley on 28 June 2004, signing on 1 August 2004 for Bradford City.\n\nBradford City\nIn a total of 53 competitive appearances for Bradford he scored 2 goals. He scored once in 47 appearances in the league, with his other goal coming in the FA Cup (an equaliser against Tranmere in November 2005).\n\nDue to limited first team opportunities he went out on loan to League Two side Notts County on 9 January 2006. He made 18 league appearances for Notts County under his former Barnsley manager Gudjon Thordarson, scoring 1 goal. After returning to Barnsley, on 8 May 2006 he was released by the club as surplus to requirements. He then entered talks with Notts County, but that did not lead to a contract.\n\nRochdale\nAs a free agent, Crooks began pre-season training with League Two side Rochdale, before signing a 12-month contract on 3 August 2006, linking up with his former Barnsley manager Steve Parkin. Crooks made 44 appearances for Rochdale, including 40 in the League. Crooks left Rochdale by mutual consent on 26 March 2008 due to limited opportunities, having made just 5 starts during that season, with no appearances since December 2007.\n\nLater career\nCrooks joined the West Yorkshire club Guiseley, playing in the Northern Premier League Premier Division. He also began training for an attempt to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support in June 2008.\n\nOn 31 December 2008 he moved from Guiseley to another West Yorkshire club, Ossett Town, playing in the Northern Premier League Premier Division.\n\nPlaying style\nIcelander Gudjon Thordarson, his manager at Barnsley and Notts County, referred to Crooks as 'The Beast' due to his combativeness. Crooks said before his Notts County debut, \"If there is a tackle to be won, I am in there. I do like a good tackle\".\n\nWhile not a prolific scorer, his first professional goal in 1999 was described by The Guardian as a \"tremendous shot which thundered in off the post.\" Similarly, his FA Cup goal for Bradford City in 2005 was described by the BBC as powerful shot which cannoned off the bar and in.\n\nIn February 2009, Crooks was described by The Times as a \"versatile defender and midfielder who ... had his most productive season in helping Manchester City win promotion in 1999\".\n\nMilitary career\n\nAfter quitting football, Crooks chose a new career path in the British Armed Forces. Choosing not to follow his younger brother into the British Army, Crooks instead signed up as an enlisted member (gunner) of the RAF Regiment, the infantry unit of the Royal Air Force, whose role is to provide force protection of RAF airfields and bases.\n\nIn February 2011 at 33 years old, he completed his seven months of RAF Regiment basic training, passing out as a leading aircraftman. Initially posted to No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, in the following weeks he underwent intensive training in the Sennybridge Training Area in Wales, and was due to visit the RAF Mount Pleasant base in the Falkland Islands followed by a deployment to the frontline in the War in Afghanistan, in early 2012.\n\nCrooks left the RAF after five-years of service.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nLiving people\n1978 births\nMen's association football defenders\nMen's association football midfielders\nEnglish men's footballers\nManchester City F.C. players\nNorthampton Town F.C. players\nBarnsley F.C. players\nBradford City A.F.C. players\nNotts County F.C. players\nRochdale A.F.C. players\nGuiseley A.F.C. players\nOssett Town A.F.C. players\nPremier League players\nEnglish Football League players\nRoyal Air Force airmen\nFootballers from Wakefield"}

It offers programs in the business, technology and health care fields. The college has 23 campus locations in five Canadian provinces: six in British Columbia, eight in Alberta, one in Manitoba, four in Ontario and five in Quebec. The school has been owned by the Eminata Group since 2007. A 2022 investigation by CBC reported that some recruiters for CDI College lied to applicants about program accreditation and the post-graduation hiring rates of its students.\n\nHistory\nThe now-defunct Corinthian Colleges, Inc. (CCi) purchased CDI Education Corporation in August 2003. CDI had a post-secondary education division of career colleges operating under the brand names of CDI College of Business and Technology and The Institute for Computer Studies. CDI's corporate training division operated under the brand name of CDI Corporation Education Services.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, Corinthian completed the sale of substantially all the assets of its corporate training division, CDI Education, for C$19 million (US$16 million) to CrossOff Incorporated. In December 2007, Corinthian re-branded its Ontario campuses as Everest College and sold the remaining campus locations across Canada to the Eminata Group.\n\nControversies\n\nThe Province investigation for dubious business practices\nIn March 2012, a two-part investigative feature in the British Columbian paper The Province reported on student complaints and dubious business practices at CDI College and two other Canadian institutions owned by Eminata—University Canada West and Vancouver Career College. In December of that year seven CDI nursing students had their Practice Permits suspended by the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Alberta. Several Edmonton-based students later filed a lawsuit, claiming that their class activities in the nursing program included wheelchair racing, watching Netflix and learning human anatomy from colouring books. CDI College terminated the LPN program in 2013. They settled the lawsuit in 2018, paying out $1.88 million.\n\nUPAC investigation for questionable recruitment practices\nIn November 2020, CDI College was named one of the ten private colleges under investigation for questionable recruitment practices, mainly targeting Indian students. The government of Quebec later suspended processing CAQ applications for CDI College, which are required for foreign students  to study in the province.\n\nIn December 2020, the college was under investigation by UPAC for financial irregularities.\n\nCBC Marketplace investigation for misleading students \n\nIn December 2022, A CBC Marketplace investigation into CDI College, one of Canada's largest for-profit career colleges, has found a pattern of misleading practices being used to pressure would-be students into signing up for online programs that can cost upward of $20,000. \n\nMarketplace has documented some CDI admissions representatives misleading journalists posing as potential online students on accreditation, salary and job rates after graduation, as well as signing up unsuitable candidates and pressuring students to enroll.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n  \n\nFor-profit universities and colleges in Canada\nUniversities and colleges established in 1970\n1970 establishments in Canada\nPrivate colleges in Quebec\nUniversities and colleges in Montreal\nColleges in Quebec\nCorinthian Colleges\nEminata Group"}

{"id": "4107000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry%20Coyer", "title": "Larry Coyer", "text": "Larry Coyer (April 19, 1943 – February 10, 2023) was an American football coach. He served as the defensive coordinator for the  Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL) from 2009 to 2011. Prior to the Colts, he was the assistant head coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and defensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos and New Mexico State.\n\nPlaying career and high school coaching\nCoyer was an outstanding player at Barboursville High School in Barboursville, West Virginia during the late 1950s\n\nA 1964 graduate of Marshall University, Coyer is a member of the Football Hall of Fame at Marshall for his achievements as a player. He began his coaching career at his alma mater in 1965 as secondary coach, a position he maintained through 1967. An additional coaching stint came at the acclaimed Massillon Washington High School, where NFL Legend Paul Brown once coached.\n\nDenver Broncos\nIn his 42nd year of coaching on either the collegiate or professional level, Coyer began his Broncos coaching career as the club's linebackers coach from 2000 to 2002 before he was promoted to defensive coordinator. Larry Coyer entered his seventh, and final, season on the Denver Broncos' coaching staff in 2006 and his fourth in the role of defensive coordinator.\n\nCoyer's defense consistently ranked among the NFL's most productive during his three seasons as the Broncos' defensive coordinator and helped the club advance to the playoffs each year. The Broncos placed in the league's top-7 in run defense in every year under Coyer and allowed an average of 93.3 rushing yards per game between 2003 and 2006 (ranking second in the NFL during that period).\n\nDenver also ranked among the league's best teams in overall defense under Coyer, posting consecutive top-4 NFL rankings in yards-per-game allowed from 2003 to 2004 and placing fourth in the league (289.5 ypg.) in that category for the period 2003–2006. In addition, the Broncos surrendered an average of 18.0 points per game between 2003 and 2006 to rank fifth in the NFL in scoring defense with Coyer at the helm. Coyer's defense was instrumental in the Broncos going 13–3 in 2005 and advancing to the AFC Championship Game. Denver, which, in 2005, sent cornerback Champ Bailey, safety John Lynch and linebacker Al Wilson to the Pro Bowl, ranked second in the NFL in run defense (85.2 ypg.) and posted the third-best such mark in franchise history. The Broncos allowed only 16.1 points per game to tie for third in the NFL and surrendered a total of 37 points in their final four games (9.3 ppg.) en route to capturing the AFC West title.\n\nCoyer began his Broncos coaching career as their linebackers coach from 2000 to 2002. In Coyer's first year instructing Denver's linebackers in 2000, John Mobley and fellow linebacker Bill Romanowski finished first and second on the team in tackles (133 and 121) while Wilson ranked fourth (104).\n\nIn his first year as the Broncos' defensive coordinator in 2003, Denver's defense allowed an average of only 277.1 yards per game. The team ranked fourth in the NFL, and earned its first postseason berth since 2000. Coyer, who also instructed the team's linebackers, worked closely with Wilson during his Pro Bowl season that saw him lead the Broncos in tackles (128) for the second consecutive year.\n\nIn 2004, Coyer's defense featured two Pro Bowl selections: Lynch and Bailey, who also earned the first All-Pro nomination of his career after joining the Broncos in an offseason trade. Coyer aided in the development of rookie linebacker D.J. Williams, who became only the second Broncos rookie and the first in 32 years to lead the team in tackles (114). Along the way, Williams was the only 2004 rookie to be named AFC Defensive Player of the Week (Wk. 16) and finished No. 3 in the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year voting.\n\nOn January 8, 2007, Coyer was released from the Denver Broncos after the 2006 season.  His release was the result of a defensive meltdown in the second half of the season. On January 18, 2007, the Bucs hired him as their defensive line coach.\n\nUSFL coaching\nCoyer's other professional coaching experience came in the United States Football League as linebackers coach with the Michigan Panthers (1983–84) and defensive coordinator with the Memphis Showboats (1985–86). Coyer helped Michigan capture the inaugural USFL championship in 1983 with a win against Philadelphia in a game played at Mile High Stadium in Denver.\n\nNCAA coaching\nCoyer was the defensive coordinator in 1993 at East Carolina, where under his guidance the Pirates improved in virtually every defensive category. He also served as defensive backs coach at Ohio State (1991–92), assistant head coach/defensive backs coach at Houston (1990) and linebackers coach at UCLA (1987–89). Coyer was also defensive coordinator at Memphis State (1986) Iowa State (1979–82), Oklahoma State (1978) and Iowa (1974–77) after serving as defensive backs coach at Bowling Green (1968–73).\n\nBefore his stint at Pittsburgh, Coyer was defensive coordinator at Iowa State University for two seasons (1995–96). That post was preceded by a one-year assignment as defensive line coach for the New York Jets in 1994.\nWhile at Pitt (1997–99) as its defensive coordinator, Coyer directed a defensive unit that showed significant improvement each season, culminating in a 1999 showing that included top-5 rankings in the Big East Conference in all major defensive statistical categories. Two of his standouts, safety Ramon Walker and defensive lineman Demond Gibson, earned All-Big East Conference honors that season. In 1998, the Panthers ranked third in the Big East in total defense, and over the course of the 1997–98 seasons, the unit amassed 62 sacks, the highest two-season total at Pittsburgh since 1990–91.\n\nIn February 2014, Coyer was hired as the defensive coordinator for New Mexico State.\n\nPersonal life and death\nCoyer died on February 10, 2023, at the age of 79.\n\nSee also\n List of NCAA major college yearly punt and kickoff return leaders\n\nReferences\n\n1943 births\n2023 deaths\nAmerican football defensive backs\nAmerican football return specialists\nBowling Green Falcons football coaches\nCoaches of American football from West Virginia\nDenver Broncos coaches\nEast Carolina Pirates football coaches\nHigh school football coaches in Ohio\nHouston Cougars football coaches\nIndianapolis Colts coaches\nIowa Hawkeyes football coaches\nIowa State Cyclones football coaches\nMarshall Thundering Herd football coaches\nMarshall Thundering Herd football players\nMarshall Thundering Herd wrestlers\nNew Mexico State Aggies football coaches\nNew York Jets coaches\nOhio State Buckeyes football coaches\nOklahoma State Cowboys football coaches\nPittsburgh Panthers football coaches\nPlayers of American football from West Virginia\nSportspeople from Huntington, West Virginia\nTampa Bay Buccaneers coaches\nUnited States Football League coaches\nUCLA Bruins football coaches\nWashington Redskins scouts"}

Known as Waterloo Road, the state highway runs  from MD 108 in Columbia north to MD 103 in Ellicott City.  MD 104 connects MD 108, MD 103, and MD 100 in northeastern Howard County.  The state highway was originally constructed as MD 531 in the early 1930s and became part of MD 175 in the mid-1940s.  After MD 175 was rerouted through Columbia in the late 1970s, MD 104 was assigned to its present course.\n\nRoute description\n\nMD 104 begins at a three-way intersection with MD 108 in the hamlet of Jonestown on the northern edge of the Columbia village of Long Reach.  MD 108 heads southeast as a continuation of Waterloo Road toward Jessup and west as Old Annapolis Road, which provides access to Howard High School and ramps to and from eastbound MD 100.  MD 104 heads north as a four-lane undivided highway across MD 100 to a roundabout where the state highway intersects ramps to and from westbound MD 100.  MD 104 reduces to two lanes and passes through a suburban area on the southern edge of Ellicott City, where the highway reaches its northern terminus at MD 103 (Montgomery Road), which heads southeast toward Elkridge and northwest toward downtown Ellicott City.\n\nHistory\nWaterloo Road was built as a macadam road in 1932 from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Jessup north to MD 103 in Ellicott City; the highway was designated MD 531.  MD 531 was replaced with a northern extension of MD 175 from Jessup to Ellicott City by 1946.  Old Annapolis Road was designated MD 539 in 1956; that highway became part of an extended MD 108 in 1960 when US 29 was moved to Columbia Pike from Silver Spring to Ellicott City.\n\nAfter MD 175 was rerouted along Little Patuxent Parkway (now named Rouse Parkway) from west of Interstate 95 (I-95) to Columbia Town Center around 1977, MD 108 was extended east to its present terminus near I-95.  The portion of Waterloo Road between MD 108 and MD 103 was designated MD 104 by 1979.  When MD 100 was under construction between MD 104 and I-95 in the late 1990s, a standard intersection with MD 104 served as the eastern terminus of the two-lane, disjoint section of MD 100 between US 29 and MD 104.  MD 104's interchange with MD 100 was completed in 1998 concurrent with the portion of the freeway from MD 104 to I-95.\n\nJunction list\n\nAuxiliary route\nMD 104A is the designation for the  section of Oak Run Way between MD 104 and the residential subdivision the street serves immediately north of MD 104's interchange with MD 100.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMDRoads: MD 104\n\n104\nMaryland Route 104"}

He served in both the First and Second World Wars. He was a Senator for Western Australia from 1920 to 1926, representing the Nationalist Party, and later served as a judge of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration from 1927 until his death in 1949.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Busselton, Western Australia, Drake-Brockman was the son of surveyor Frederick Slade Drake-Brockman and heroine Grace Vernon Bussell and brother of Deborah Vernon Hackett. He was a 1902 graduate of the Guildford Grammar School. Interested in the military, he joined the Citizen Military Forces as a volunteer in 1903. He combined this with a career in law, becoming a barrister and solicitor in 1909, practicing in Perth.\n\nFirst World War\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for overseas service and served in the Gallipoli Campaign as a major while assigned to the 11th Battalion. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for his services at Gallipoli. Later in the war, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and commanded another Western Australian infantry battalion, the 16th, serving on the Western Front. In 1918, he was promoted to brigadier general and commanded the 4th Brigade.\n\nPolitics\nDrake-Brockman was elected to the Senate at the 1919 federal election, one of a number of former AIF commanders elected as Nationalists. He was the first native-born Western Australian to be elected to the Senate, and only the second to be elected to federal parliament (after Sir John Forrest). Drake-Brockman became a \"loyal government supporter\". In 1923, when parliament reconvened after the 1922 election, he was appointed as government whip.\n\nIn parliament, Drake-Brockman spoke frequently on defence issues. He supported the government's Defence Bill 1921 which would have applied the United Kingdom's Army Act to the Australian military, and warned of Japanese aggression in the Pacific in the context of \"the preservation of a White Australia\". On trade policy, he \"argued that the protective tariff disadvantaged the primary producing Western Australians\" and opposed the government's establishment of the Tariff Board. Drake-Brockman was a member of several select committees, including that which recommended that the government commission Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) to develop an overseas radio communication service. In 1925 he represented Australia at the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva.\n\nIn 1924, Drake-Brockman was elected president of the Central Council of Australian Employers, an employers' federation, succeeding George Fairbairn. At the annual convention later in the year, he \"urged the employers to strenuously resist the rising tide of socialism\" and advocated a return to piece work rather than wages.\n\nDrake-Brockman did not recontest the 1925 federal election, in order to allow the Nationalists to put forward a joint ticket with their coalition partners the Country Party. He was the most junior of the three Nationalist senators in Western Australia up for re-election. His term expired in June 1926.\n\nJudicial career and later life\n\nIn April 1927, Drake-Brockman was appointed to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. \n\nStill in the Citizen Military Forces, he was called up for duty during the Second World War, and commanded the 3rd Division, a militia formation, until 1942. He died on 1 June 1949, and was survived the three children he had by his wife, Constance, whom he had married in April 1912.\n\nReferences\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nMallett, Ross, Major General Edmund Drake-Brockman, General Officers of the First AIF, adfa.edu.au\nObituary, Obituaries Australia, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University\n\n1884 births\n1949 deaths\nMilitary personnel from Western Australia\n20th-century Australian politicians\nAustralian Companions of the Distinguished Service Order\nAustralian Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George\nAustralian Companions of the Order of the Bath\nAustralian generals\nAustralian military personnel of World War I\nAustralian Army personnel of World War II\nDrake-Brockman family\nMembers of the Australian Senate for Western Australia\nNationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia\nPeople from Busselton"}

As a high school student at University City High School in nearby University City, the teenager came into contact with the influential Black Artists' Group (BAG, 1968–72) which was modelled after the AACM in Chicago.\n\nLater, during formal studies at the New England Conservatory, Ehrlich developed a particularly close relationship with pianist Jaki Byard. It was here that he was most deeply schooled in traditional jazz forms, as well as Western European classical music.  During these formative years, Ehrlich was exposed to the cultural, political and musical workings of radical African-American art, and was mentored by such legends as Julius Hemphill and Oliver Lake. Often associated with \"Radical Jewish Culture\" and cult icon John Zorn, Ehrlich has throughout the years nevertheless resisted classification under any single musical genre. He has, for instance, been a mainstay of trumpeter Randy Sandke's Inside Out ensemble, which offers a unique combination of avant-garde–associated figures and mainstreamers.\n\nSince his 1978 move to New York, Ehrlich has been a performer and leader with numerous bands of legendary repute, as well as a soloist for a number of major orchestras. But perhaps his most important recent contribution to the story of Jazz and improvised musics, The Long View, was completed at a residency in Harvard. The composition (scored for an ensemble of both strings and horns) is inspired from abstract paintings by Oliver Jackson, and has been hailed as \"one of a handful of integral long-form works in jazz, standing beside those of the likes of Hemphill, Mingus, and Ellington\" (Boston Phoenix).\n\nEhrlich currently lives in New York City, commuting to teach at Hampshire College, and devoting much energy to his duo with pianist Myra Melford, and trio with Mark Dresser (contrabass) and Andrew Cyrille (drums).\n\nDiscography\n\nAs leader \n The Welcome with Anthony Cox, Pheeroan akLaff (1984)\n Pliant Pliant with Stan Strickland, Anthony Cox, Bobby Previte (1988)\n Falling Man with Anthony Cox (Muse (1989)\n The Traveller's Tale with Stan Strickland, Lindsey Horner, Bobby Previte (1990)\n Side by Side with Frank Lacy, Wayne Horvitz, Anthony Cox, Andrew Cyrille (1991)\n Marty Ehrlich's Dark Woods Ensemble, Emergency Peace (New World, 1991) – with Abdul Wadud, Muhal Richard Abrams, Lindsey Horner\n Can You Hear a Motion? with Stan Strickland, Michael Formanek, Bobby Previte (1994)\n Marty Ehrlich's Dark Woods Ensemble, Just Before the Dawn (New World, 1995) – with Vincent Chancey, Erik Friedlander, Mark Helias, Don Alias\n New York Child with Stan Strickland, Michael Cain, Michael Formanek, Bill Stewart (Enja, 1996) – recorded in 1995\n Light at the Crossroads with Ben Goldberg (Songlines Recordings, 1997) – recorded in 1996\n Marty Ehrlich's Dark Woods Ensemble, Live Wood (Music & Arts, 1997) - with Erik Friedlander, Mark Helias. recorded in 1996.\n Marty Ehrlich's Dark Woods Ensemble, Sojourn (Tzadik, 1999) – with Erik Friedlander, Mark Helias, Marc Ribot\n The Waiting Game with Mike Nock (Naxos Jazz, 2000)\n Marty Ehrlich's Traveler's Tales, Malinke's Dance (OmniTone, 2000) – with Tony Malaby, Jerome Harris, Bobby Previte\n Song (Enja, 2001) – with Uri Caine, Michael Formanek, Billy Drummond, Ray Anderson\n The Long View (Enja, 2002)\n Line on Love (Palmetto, 2003) – with Craig Taborn, Michael Formanek, Billy Drummond\n News on the Rail (Palmetto, 2005) - recorded in 2004\n Marty Ehrlich Rites Quartet, Things Have Got to Change (Clean Feed, 2009)\n Fables (Tzadik, 2010)\n Marty Ehrlich Rites Quartet, Frog Leg Logic (Clean Feed, 2011)\n Marty Ehrlich Large Ensemble, A Trumpet in the Morning (New World, 2013) - recorded in 2012\n Trio Exaltation (Clean Feed, 2018)\n\nAs sideman \nWith Ray Anderson\nBig Band Record (Gramavision, 1994) with the George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band\n\nWith Anthony Braxton\nKnitting Factory (Piano/Quartet) 1994, Vol. 1 (Leo, 1994)\n Creative Orchestra (Köln) 1978 (hatART, 1995) – recorded 1978\nPiano Quartet, Yoshi's 1994 (Music & Arts, 1996) – recorded 1994\nKnitting Factory (Piano/Quartet) 1994, Vol. 2 (Leo, 2000) – recorded 1994\n\nWith John Carter\n Castles of Ghana (Gramavision, 1986)\n Dance of the Love Ghosts (Gramavision, 1987)\n Fields (Gramavision, 1988)\n Shadows on a Wall (Gramavision, 1989)\n\nWith Anthony Coleman\n Lapidation (New World, 2007)\n\nWith Don Grolnick\n Nighttown (Blue Note, 1992)\n\nWith the Julius Hemphill Sextet\n Fat Man and the Hard Blues (Black Saint, 1991)\n Five Chord Stud (Black Saint, 1994)\n At Dr. King's Table (New World, 1997)\n The Hard Blues: Live in Lisbon (Cleanfeed, 2004)\n\nWith Michael Gregory Jackson\n Gifts (Arista Novus, 1979)\n\nWith Leroy Jenkins\n Mixed Quintet (Black Saint, 1979)\n Themes & Improvisations on the Blues (CRI, 1994)\n\nWith John Lindberg\n Dimension 5 (Black Saint, 1981)\n\nWith Myra Melford\nEven the Sounds Shine (Hat ART, 1995)\n\nWith Roscoe Mitchell\nSketches from Bamboo (Moers Music, 1979)\n\nWith Bobby Previte\n Weather Clear, Track Fast (Enja, 1991)\n Hue and Cry (Enja, 1993)\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nARIA Music Awards\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music.

{"id": "4107059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewliner", "title": "Viewliner", "text": "The Viewliner is a single-level railroad car type operated by Amtrak on most long-distance routes operating east of Chicago. The first production cars, consisting of an order of 50 sleeping cars, entered service in 1994. From 2015-2016, 70 Viewliner II baggage cars entered service. The new baggage cars are used on all Amtrak trains with full baggage cars, both single-level and bi-level, and replaced all of the Heritage Fleet baggage cars that Amtrak inherited from the freight railroads when it was established in 1971. From 2016-2019, 25 Viewliner II dining cars entered service, which replaced all of the Heritage Fleet dining cars. In 2019, 10 Viewliner II baggage-dormitory cars entered service. The last cars to enter service were 25 Viewliner II sleeping cars in 2021.\n\nEarly design\n\nIn the 1980s, Amtrak was looking to replace its Heritage Fleet railcars, which had been in service as far back as the 1940s. While new Superliner cars were built starting in 1979, those cars were too tall to run on Amtrak's eastern routes because of clearance issues in and around both New York Pennsylvania Station and Baltimore Pennsylvania Station.\n\nWorking with the Budd Company, Amtrak drafted plans for new single-level sleeping and dining cars that utilized a modular design where the interiors of the cars, especially the sleepers, were built in units separate from the exterior shell. These units contain all fixtures, electrical components, sewage and fresh water handling internally and are then mated with the car exterior shell upon assembly. This approach allows for easier maintenance and reconfiguration through removal and replacement of individual units. Access for this purpose is via a removable hatch on the side of the car, a distinguishing feature of the Viewliner series. Unlike the Superliners, occupants of both bunks in the bedrooms have an outside view. The design of the cars was created by Amtrak's design group, which received input from every department in the company. At the time of their introduction into service, Amtrak planned to assemble a fleet of over a thousand cars during the ten years after their introduction.\n\nThe prototype Viewliner cars were assembled at Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops in Beech Grove, Indiana, in 1987-1988 from Budd components. Two sleeping cars (2300 and 2301) were built, as was one dining car (8400). These cars were tested on the Capitol Limited beginning in 1988. They were also tested on other trains, such as the Night Owl and the Auto Train. The prototypes were in regular service until 2002.\n\nThe prototype Viewliner dining car, number 8400, was later rebuilt with stimulus funding and restored to revenue service in October 2011 and given the name Indianapolis. Originally a prototype dining car with experimental trucks built during the Viewliner design phase in the late 1980s, the car was completely rebuilt at Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops and currently serves on Eastern long distance trains. Information learned from building and using this car was applied to the dining cars included in the new order of Viewliner II cars.\n\nProduction\n\nViewliner I\nThe first production Viewliners were built in 19951996 by Amerail (now Alstom)/Morrison-Knudsen. Amtrak's original intention in the 1980s was to order 500600 new cars, of which 100 would be sleepers and the rest coaches, diners, and lounges. This would have enabled Amtrak to replace its remaining Heritage Fleet equipment and run trains with solid Viewliner consists. Ultimately, Amtrak awarded a contract for 50 sleeping cars with an option for 227 cars of various types to Morrison-Knudsen, who were also building the new California Cars based on the Superliner design. Morrison-Knudsen unveiled the first Viewliner shell at its Chicago plant on October 26, 1994. The first entered service on the Lake Shore Limited in November 1995. All Viewliner I cars were alphabetically named in the \"View\" series to signify their uniqueness as a new car type, starting with American View and finishing with Winter View. Prototype sleeper 2301 was renumbered to 62091 and given the name Eastern View at this time as well.\n\nAfter Morrison-Knudsen was placed in bankruptcy, the outstanding orders were completed by Amerail with final delivery in 1996 alongside the California Car fleet. After the first 50 cars were delivered, none of the remaining 177 options were exercised. The 50 Viewliners arrived just in time to retire most of Amtrak's remaining Heritage sleeping cars, which were coming under increasing environmental pressure due to their use of non-retention toilets. Since 1995, Viewliner sleepers have operated on East Coast single-level trains in concert with Amfleet coaches and Heritage diners (and eventually Viewliner diners). \n\nWhen Amtrak decided on the names for the new Viewliner II sleeping cars, they also announced new names for the Viewliner I sleepers. The View series was to be replaced by the new River series, named alphabetically after major rivers east of the Mississippi. Starting with Altamaha River and finishing with Pearl River, they were to match the incoming cars. Amtrak had removed the \"View\" series names from the Viewliner I cars in the mid 2000's, however, only two would be renamed into the \"River\" series; 62014 was renamed Croton River from Imperial View and 62043 was renamed New River from Sunset View. New River is also the only Viewliner I sleeper painted in Amtrak's Phase IIIB paint scheme.\n\nViewliner II\n\nOn July 23, 2010, Amtrak ordered 130 Viewliner II cars55 baggage cars, 25 dining cars, 25 sleepers, and 25 baggage-dormitorieswith an option for up to 70 additional cars. The five-year order, worth $298.1 million, was placed with CAF USA in Elmira, New York, a fully owned subsidiary of Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles. According to former Amtrak president Joseph Boardman, CAF was selected over Alstom, the only other bidder, due to CAF's lower bid and it being able to construct the entire car at its factory, rather than relying on subcontractors. In August 2014, the order was modified by swapping 15 baggage-dormitories for 15 baggage cars, changing their totals to 10 and 70, respectively.\n\nThe first car from the order was originally scheduled to roll off the assembly line in October 2012, but was delayed by more than a year, with field testing beginning in June 2014. CAF had multiple issues, including failure to detect defects in the baggage cars, and quality issues with initial construction of the diner and sleeping cars. Amtrak also experienced project management challenges in addressing these faults. While all 130 cars were originally expected to be delivered by the end of 2015, by December 2016 only the baggage cars and one diner were in service. The final cars were delivered in August 2021. \n\nViewliner II cars feature an updated version of Amtrak's older Phase III paint scheme, known as Phase IIIB. The baggage cars are numbered 61000–61069 and the baggage-dormitories are numbered 69000–69009. The dining cars, numbered 68000–68024, are named alphabetically after the first 25 state capitals east of the Mississippi River starting with Albany and finishing with Tallahassee. Prototype Viewliner I diner 8400 was rebuilt and named Indianapolis. The sleeping cars (62500–62524) are alphabetically named after major rivers east of the Mississippi, starting with Portage River and finishing with Westfield River. This continues from the planned renaming of the Viewliner I sleepers.  Unlike the roomettes on Viewliner I sleepers, the Viewliner II roomettes do not have in-room toilets; instead, there are two shared restrooms. Because of this, the Viewliner II sleepers have one fewer roomette than the Viewliner I sleepers11 versus 12.\n\nInspection cars\nBoth prototype sleepers would be rebuilt into company inspection cars in the 2010's. In March 2014, number 2301 (which had been renumbered to 62091 and renamed Eastern View) was converted into an inspection car and renumbered 10004 as well as given the name American View. This inspection car has rear-facing seats and a large glass window at the end that allows passengers to observe the tracks. American View is used by maintenance crews to visually inspect the tracks for defects and by the Amtrak president and other executives for official purposes. Number 2300 was rebuilt into a track-geometry car in October 2020.\n\nFuture cars\nIn 2022, Amtrak announced that they would be replacing all of their current Superliner, Amfleet II, and Viewliner I passenger cars used for long-distance service by 2032. Amtrak issued a request for information from ten manufacturers in December 2022. Request for proposals are planned for 2023.\n\nService\nViewliner passenger cars are designed for use on Amtrak's long-distance routes in the Eastern United States: the Cardinal, Crescent, Lake Shore Limited, Silver Meteor and Silver Star. This is due to clearance restrictions in and around New York Pennsylvania Station and Baltimore Pennsylvania Station that prevent tall bi-level cars from clearing the tunnels.\n\nViewliner baggage cars are used on all Superliner and single-level trains which use full baggage cars on the Amtrak system. The first Viewliner baggage cars entered service on March 23, 2015 on multiple Eastern routes, with the last entering service in December 2016.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\nViewliner 3D Tour \n\nAmtrak rolling stock\nRail passenger cars of the United States\nTrain-related introductions in 1995"}

At present, there are 30 local branches of the Society, called Centres, in towns and cities across the country from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Victoria, British Columbia, and as far north as Whitehorse, Yukon.  There are about 5100 members from coast to coast to coast, and internationally. The membership is composed primarily of amateur astronomers and also includes numerous professional astronomers and astronomy educators.  The RASC is the Canadian equivalent of the British Astronomical Association.\n\nHistory\nThe RASC has its original roots in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where in 1868 a group of friends began meeting as part of the \"Toronto Astronomical Club.\" The club was formally incorporated as \"The Astronomical and Physical Society of Toronto\" in 1890, and this is considered the founding date of the Society. The club grew over time, and by 1900, surrounding communities were affiliated with the group.  On 1903 March 3, the club was renamed to \"The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada\" after petitioning King Edward VII to use the prefix \"Royal\" in the group's name. At the time it had 120 members. In the more than a century since its formal incorporation, the RASC has expanded across Canada with Centres in 30 cities, reaching every province of Canada with the exception of Prince Edward Island.\n\nOrganization\n\nMandate\nThe RASC mandate is five-fold:\n to stimulate interest and to promote and increase knowledge in astronomy and related sciences;\n to acquire and maintain equipment, libraries, and other property necessary for the pursuit of its aims;\n to publish journals, books, and other material containing information on the progress of astronomy and the work of the Society;\n to receive and administer gifts, donations, and bequests from members of the Society and others;\n to make contributions and render assistance to individuals and institutions engaged in the study and advancement of astronomy.\n\nSociety Office\nThe Society Office in Toronto employs three staff.\n\nBoard of directors\nPresident (1-year term)\n1st Vice-President (1-year term, Chair of Publications Committee and Chair of Constitution Committee)\n2nd Vice-President (1-year term, Chair of Nominating Committee)\nTreasurer (1-year term, Chair of Finance Committee)\nNational Secretary (1-year term)\nUp to four (4) Directors\nExecutive Director (Appointed - non-voting)\n\nNational Council\n\nCentre Representatives\nAt least one representative from each Centre, plus two Unattached Member reps\nPast Presidents\nImmediate Past President\nEditors\nObserver's Handbook Editor (5-year term)\nJournal Editor (5-year term)\nObserver's Calendar Editor (5-year term)\nBulletin Editor (5-year term)\n\nStaff (Non-voting)\nFinance Officer\nPermanent Committees (Chairs)\nAstroimaging\nAwards (Past President)\nConstitution (1st Vice-President)\nEducation and Public Outreach\nFinance (Treasurer)\nFundraising\nHistory\nInformation Technology\nLight-Pollution Abatement\nMembership and Development\nNominating (2nd Vice-President)\nObserving\nPublications (1st Vice-President)\n\nConduct of Business\nThe RASC conducts business through a Board of Directors with regular meetings, plus two scheduled meetings at the General Assembly, which is traditionally held on the May or July long weekend (GA).  The GA is hosted by one of the Centres, with annual meetings alternating between eastern and western Canada.  Meetings follow Robert's Rules of Order and are governed by the By-Laws of the Society.\n\nCentres\nEach of the Centres of the Society conduct a variety of activities of interest to its members and to the public. At regular meetings, well-known professional and amateur astronomers give lectures on a variety of topics of current interest. In addition, there are study and special-interest groups. Most Centres publish their own newsletters and hold their own group-observing events. Some members take part in regular observations of variable stars, lunar occultations, sunspots, meteors, comets, and other phenomena; others develop special skills such as astroimaging at workshops.\n\nOutreach\nMost Centres have public education programs, including special outreach star nights when the public is given an opportunity to look through a telescope courtesy of a RASC volunteer.  In 2009, the International Year of Astronomy, many Centres were instrumental in organizing events of educational astronomy outreach for their local communities. The RASC's Light-Pollution Abatement Committee also administers Canada's Dark-sky preserve program, working with provincial and national parks to create management agreements to preserve the darkness of the nighttime sky.\n\nResources\nMany Centres have observing equipment, libraries, and observing locations.  For example, the Victoria Centre has telescopes and a large library of books and periodicals available to members in good standing.  Additionally the Victoria Centre built and operates the \"RASC Victoria Centre Observatory (RASC VCO)\" which is located at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory. The Society has recently purchased a robotic telescope.\n\nPublications and awards\nThe RASC publishes a number of books and periodicals, and issues awards to recognize accomplishments in astronomy and outreach activities.\n\nRecurring Publications\nThe annual Observer's Handbook (2021: ) can be found in observatory control rooms and astronomers' reference shelves worldwide. Published in the autumn of the year, the 352-page Handbook contains detailed information on astronomical events in the upcoming year and is an in-depth reference of significant astronomical data such as observing techniques, physical constants, and optical properties of telescopes.  The first two editions were published in 1907 and 1908, respectively. For the following two years information from the Observer's Handbook was integrated into the main Journal, but it was decided eventually that the Handbook return to circulation. The 3rd edition of the Observer's Handbook was published in January 1911, with Editor C. A. Chant aiming to publish the 1912 edition in the autumn of that year.

{"id": "4107089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland%20Route%20103", "title": "Maryland Route 103", "text": "Maryland Route 103 (MD 103) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The state highway runs  from St. Johns Lane in Ellicott City east to Parkway Drive South in Hanover. MD 103 serves as the local complement to MD 100 from Ellicott City in northeastern Howard County through Dorsey to Hanover in northwestern Anne Arundel County. The state highway was constructed from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Elkridge to US 29 in Ellicott City in the 1920s.  MD 103's eastern terminus was relocated from Elkridge to US 1 near Dorsey in 1956.  When MD 100 was constructed between Glen Burnie and Ellicott City in the 1990s, the state highway was extended to its present western and eastern termini. MD 103 replaced MD 176 from US 1 east to near MD 295.\n\nRoute description\n\nMD 103 begins at a point on St. Johns Lane just west of its intersection with High Point Road in Ellicott City. St. Johns Lane continues west to Columbia Road, where the county highway turns north toward US 40. MD 103 heads east as Montgomery Road, a four-lane undivided highway, through a three-quarter diamond interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike). Access to MD 103 from northbound US 29 is via MD 100 and Long Gate Parkway, which the state highway intersects east of Old Columbia Pike, which heads northeast into the Ellicott City Historic District. East of Long Gate Parkway, MD 103 reduces to two lanes and has a sporadic center left-turn lane. Before leaving Ellicott City, the highway intersects the northern terminus of MD 104 (Waterloo Road) and Ilchester Road, which heads east to the hamlet of Ilchester on the Patapsco River, where the county highway provides access to Patapsco Valley State Park and the ruins of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Patterson Viaduct. On the western edge of Elkridge at Miller's Corner, MD 103 intersects the county-maintained portion of Montgomery Road, which heads east to the center of Elkridge.\n\nMD 103 continues southeast along Meadowridge Road, which meets MD 100 at a dumbbell interchange. The highway passes under Interstate 95 (I-95) with no access and passes between Meadow Ridge Memorial Park on the north and an industrial park to the south before its intersection with US 1 (Washington Boulevard). MD 103 continues east as Dorsey Road, which curves northeast and then southeast again. The route crosses Deep Run and passes through the community of Dorsey, where the highway enters Anne Arundel County by passing under CSX's Capital Subdivision railroad line, which carries MARC's Camden Line. The highway crosses a branch of Deep Run and begins to parallel the eastbound side of MD 100. MD 103's name changes to Parkway Drive South at its intersection with Coca-Cola Drive, which is unsigned MD 100M and has an interchange with MD 100 immediately to the north. The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at an arbitrary point east of Race Road in a business park adjacent to MD 100's interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway) in Hanover.\n\nMD 103 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector from US 1 east to Douglas Legum Drive at Dorsey.\n\nHistory\nMD 103 originally followed all of Montgomery Road from US 1 in Elkridge, which followed Old Washington Road, to US 29 (Old Columbia Pike) in Ellicott City.  The first section of MD 103 was paved in concrete from US 1 to west of Landing Road by 1923.  The next section was constructed as a concrete road from there west to the highway's intersection with Meadowridge Road at Miller's Corner in 1924 and 1925.  A disjoint section of MD 103 was built from US 29 east to near New Cut Road in 1928.  Montgomery Road was completed from near New Cut Road east to Miller's Corner by 1930.\n\nThe portion of MD 103 east of US 1 was originally part of MD 176, which was completed as a concrete road from Glen Burnie west to the B&O Railroad in Dorsey on the Howard–Anne Arundel county line by 1930.  The portion between the county line and US 1 was constructed around 1936;  MD 176 originally met US 1 at an intersection just south of the modern US 1–MD 100 interchange.  The Howard County portion of MD 176 was widened in 1949.  MD 103 was widened from US 1 to Waterloo Road, which was then part of MD 175, in 1950.  The state highway was widened from Waterloo Road to US 29 starting in 1953.  In 1956, MD 103 was removed from Montgomery Road from Miller's Corner to Elkridge and instead placed on Meadowridge Road from Miller's Corner to US 1 near Dorsey.\n\nSeveral changes occurred in the route of MD 103 due to the construction of MD 100 in the 1990s.  MD 103 was extended to its present western terminus when its interchange with US 29 was built in 1992.  The western end of MD 176 was relocated to the double-curve alignment in Dorsey to tie into the eastern end of MD 103 by 1995.  MD 176 was cut in two when MD 100 took over the former highway's interchange with the Baltimore–Washington Parkway.  By 1997, MD 103 replaced MD 176 on Dorsey Road west of the parkway.  That same year, the intersection of Montgomery Road and Meadowridge Road was reconstructed to make MD 103 the through route instead of Montgomery Road.  MD 103's interchange with MD 100 was completed in 1998 when MD 100 opened from MD 104 to I-95.\n\nJunction list\n\nAuxiliary routes\nMD 103A is the designation for the  segment of Montgomery Road between US 1 and Old Washington Road in Elkridge.\nMD 103C is the designation for the unnamed  service road that serves a shopping center at MD 103's intersection with MD 104 near Ellicott City.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMDRoads: MD 103\n\n103\nMaryland Route 103\nMaryland Route 103"}

Martin is the all-time winningest coach in NCAA Division I college baseball.  Upon the completion of his career, Martin had compiled a record of 2,029 wins, 736 losses and four ties over 40 seasons of collegiate coaching. On May 5, 2018, Martin reached 1,976 career wins, surpassing legendary coach Augie Garrido.\n\nMartin, a native of Charlotte, North Carolina, began his collegiate playing career at Wingate Junior College where he was a Junior College All-American.  He then transferred to Florida State, where he played from 1965 to 1966 and graduated in 1966.  During his years as the center fielder at Florida State, Martin hit .354, and earned all-District honors in his senior season and played in the 1965 College World Series.  After his college career was over, Martin played professional baseball in the New York Mets and Detroit Tigers minor league organizations for three seasons before beginning his career in coaching.\n\nMartin began his career in coaching at the junior high school level. His first stint as a college coach, surprisingly, came in a different sport, basketball, when Martin became the head basketball coach at Tallahassee Community College during the 1970–1971 season.\n\nIt was in 1975, when Woody Woodward took over the head coaching job at Florida State, that Martin would be reunited with his alma mater.  Martin served as an assistant coach under Woodward for four seasons, and then for another season under Dick Howser.  Howser would get his chance to manage the New York Yankees and Martin stepped into the head coaching role at Florida State in 1980.\n\nThough Martin's teams did not win a national title, his tenure at Florida State was marked with many honors and feats. Florida State, as of the 2019 season, has made 43 straight postseason appearances (41 under Martin), the longest active streak in the country. Martin's Seminoles won eight Atlantic Coast Conference tournament championships and appeared in 17 College World Series.\n\nMartin's players, which include many college and professional standouts such as Deion Sanders, J. D. Drew, Doug Mientkiewicz, Stephen Drew, Paul Wilson, Lincoln R. \"Link\" Jarrett, and Buster Posey, have excelled as well. More than 70 of Martin's players have been named All-Americans, five have been named national player of the year, four have won the Golden Spikes Award, considered to be the most prestigious individual award in amateur baseball, and two - J.D. Drew and Posey - have won the Dick Howser Trophy, considered to be the equivalent of the Heisman Trophy for baseball. Martin has won the ACC Coach of the Year award seven times (1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2009, 2012).\n\nOn June 18, 2018, it was announced that Martin would retire following the 2019 season.\n\nFlorida State's baseball team plays on Mike Martin Field at Dick Howser Stadium, dedicated in 2005.\n\nOn March 9, 2019, Martin became the first coach to achieve 2,000 career wins with a 5–2 victory over Virginia Tech in the second game of a doubleheader. In 2019, Martin was inducted into the National College Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nSee also\n List of college baseball coaches with 1,100 wins\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Florida State profile\n\n1944 births\nLiving people\nFlorida State Seminoles baseball coaches\nFlorida State Seminoles baseball players\nGreenville Mets players\nWinter Haven Mets players\nWingate Bulldogs baseball players\nMankato Mets players\nRocky Mount Leafs players\nPeople from Gastonia, North Carolina\nBaseball coaches from North Carolina\nJunior college men's basketball coaches in the United States\nNational College Baseball Hall of Fame inductees"}

At around the same time, the band changed their name from Wolfpack to Wolfbrigade to avoid association with a Swedish neo-Nazi prison gang who shared that name. In 2002, drummer Frank left and was replaced by Dadde. The band split up in 2004 because of lack of motivation and Micke needing surgery for vocal cord problems. Four of the members started a new band, Today's Overdose.\n\nOn 7 January 2007, Wolfbrigade announced that they were reuniting. Wolfbrigade imported bassist Johan from Today's Overdose and released a comeback album, Prey to the World, in June 2007. In 2008, the group released Comalive. Wolfbrigade went on a one-year hiatus from playing live in 2011, and then regrouped for the release of Damned in 2012.\n\nWolfbrigade's last album The Enemy: Reality was released Fall 2019 through Southern Lord Records.

In 2004, Chilaka joined Notts County after Notts County youth team coach Neville Hamilton had previously worked with the player at Rushden. He impressed during his year in the club's youth system, and subsequently signed a one-year professional contract on 4 July 2005. He made one first-team appearance for the club in the Football League Trophy 5–2 defeat at Northampton Town in October 2005. In December 2005, Chilaka joined Hinckley United on a three-month loan spell, playing two games for the club before Notts County recalled him on 10 January 2006. Chilaka was released by Notts County in May 2006.\n\nHe studied at the University of Hull, captaining and managing the team due to their ex-manager leaving. He also played for England Universities. Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Chilaka had a successful trial with Hull City but decided to finish his university course studying Human Biology. He played for Bridlington Town during the 2008–09 season, scoring a total of 38 goals for Bridlington in all competitions, 25 of which came in the league. During the following season, he played for Leeds Carnegie, where he scored 20 league goals in 29 appearances. He also won the club's Player of the Season award at the end of the 2009–10 campaign. Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Chilaka went on trial at Conference North side Guiseley, scoring twice in a friendly against Farsley. Guiseley manager Steve Kittrick was keen to sign Chilaka, but the player joined Bradford City on trial instead.\n\nBradford City\nAfter a successful trial period, he was signed by Bradford City on non-contract terms. Chilaka made his debut for Bradford in the club's 2–1 League Cup defeat against Preston North End, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute in the match. He made his league debut for the club against Morecambe on 2 October 2010, again coming off the substitute's bench. After three appearances in league and cup matches, he was loaned to Bradford Park Avenue in November 2010 to gain match fitness. Chilaka scored on his debut for Bradford Park Avenue in the side's 3–1 win against Eccleshill United in the West Riding County Cup. However, Chilaka was ineligible to play in the match and Eccleshill were subsequently reinstated into the competition at Avenue's expense. He played his first league game on 11 December 2010, scoring the winning goal in the 93rd minute in the club's 3–2 away victory at Burscough, a game in which Avenue came from two goals down to win. Chilaka's loan spell at the club was disrupted by the snow throughout November and December 2010, resulting in a spate of postponements. This meant that he played just one league game for Bradford Park Avenue during his loan spell, scoring one goal.\n\nIn February 2011, Chilaka went out on loan again, this time to Conference North side Harrogate Town, making his debut in the club's 3–1 away win at Gainsborough Trinity. He scored a hat-trick in his final game before his loan spell ended as Harrogate ran out 3–0 winners against Gloucester City on 26 March. Chilaka played eight games for Harrogate, scoring three times. On his return to Bradford, he appeared as a second-half substitute in the club's 2–1 away loss to Stevenage. He was released by Bradford City on 10 May 2011, and signed for Braintree Town in August.\n\nHarrogate Town\nOn 2 February 2012, Chilaka signed for Harrogate Town.\n\nIn 2013, Harrogate released Chilaka.\n\nBradford Park Avenue\nChilaka joined Bradford Park Avenue as a free agent on 5 July 2013.\n\nPersonal life \nHis younger brother, Nduoma, is also a footballer, who has played for a number of non-League football clubs as well US University soccer team Regis Rangers (Regis University).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLiving people\n1986 births\nNigerian men's footballers\nNigerian expatriate men's footballers\nNotts County F.C. players\nHinckley United F.C. players\nBridlington Town A.F.C. players\nBradford City A.F.C. players\nHarrogate Town A.F.C. players\nBradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C. players\nBraintree Town F.C. players\nEnglish Football League players\nAlumni of the University of Hull\nMen's association football midfielders\nShaw Lane A.F.C. players\nGainsborough Trinity F.C. players\nHyde United F.C. players\nGrantham Town F.C. players\nMatlock Town F.C. players\nNorthern Premier League players"}

{"id": "4107121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam%20Cameron", "title": "Cam Cameron", "text": "Malcolm \"Cam\" Cameron (born February 6, 1961) is an American football coach.  He is the former offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of the LSU Tigers football program. Cameron attended Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and played quarterback for the school. Cameron began his coaching career in the NCAA with the Michigan Wolverines. After that he switched to the National Football League (NFL), where he was offensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens and the San Diego Chargers and head coach for the Miami Dolphins, coaching them to a 1–15 record in his only season.\n\nEarly years and education\nCameron was born February 6, 1961, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. A multi-sport athlete, Cameron was an All-American quarterback at Terre Haute South Vigo High School in Terre Haute, Indiana. But before he went to Terre Haute South he also went to Saint Patrick School. He won the 1979 Trester Award for mental attitude as a guard on the high school basketball team which went to the state finals three years in a row. He played football and basketball at Indiana University under coaches Lee Corso and Bob Knight, respectively, until a knee injury ended his playing career. As an undergraduate, he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He graduated from Indiana in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in business.\n\nCoaching career\n\nMichigan \nCameron spent the first ten years of his career at the University of Michigan, where he learned from long-time Wolverine coach Bo Schembechler. After two years as a graduate assistant, he became Michigan's youngest assistant and was responsible for tutoring quarterbacks and receivers. He coached many future NFL players, including Jim Harbaugh, Elvis Grbac, Todd Collins, Amani Toomer, Derrick Alexander and Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard.  Cameron served as an assistant at Michigan alongside future head coaches Lloyd Carr, Gary Moeller, Les Miles, and Mike DeBord.  His fellow graduate assistant was Mike Trgovac, who was the former defensive line coach of the Green Bay Packers, after serving six years as the defensive coordinator of the Carolina Panthers.\n\nWashington Redskins \nCameron was the quarterbacks coach for the Washington Redskins between 1994 and 1996. He is credited with guiding quarterback Gus Frerotte to his only Pro Bowl appearance in 1997, and also played a key role in the development of Pro Bowl quarterback Trent Green.\n\nReturn to Indiana \nCameron returned to his alma mater to serve as the head coach for the Indiana University Hoosiers in 1997. In five seasons, he achieved a record of 18-37. Cameron brought an explosive offense to Indiana with highly effective offensive players such as Antwaan Randle El. Indiana averaged 23.6 points per game under Cameron's guidance. In fact, Randle El became the first player in NCAA Division I history to pass for 40 career touchdowns and score 40 career rushing touchdowns.  He finished his college career as fifth on the all-time NCAA total yardage list, and became the first player in college football history to record 2,500 total yards for each of four consecutive years.\n\nAlthough Cameron's Indiana teams won less than one-third of their games, Indiana was recognized by the American Football Coaches Association for its exemplary football graduation rates in each of Cameron's final four seasons. He was fired after the 2001 season.\n\nSan Diego Chargers\nFrom 2002–2006, he served as the offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers. In 2004, San Diego scored 446 points, third-highest in the NFL that year and the third-most in team history. Following the 2004 campaign, Sports Illustrated named Cameron its Offensive Assistant of the Year. In 2005, the Chargers averaged 26.1 points per game, fifth in the NFL in that category. In 2006, the Chargers offense amassed a team-record 494 points while paving the way for league MVP LaDainian Tomlinson to break the single-season touchdown record. In addition to Tomlinson, Cameron had the opportunity to work with Pro Bowl quarterbacks Drew Brees and Philip Rivers, as well as All-Pro tight end Antonio Gates in San Diego. He brought in former Hoosier Kris Dielman as left guard.\n\nMiami Dolphins\nCameron was interviewed for a number of head coaching jobs, including the Houston Texans and St. Louis Rams vacancies following the 2005 season but was not hired. Cameron also interviewed for the head coaching jobs with the Arizona Cardinals and Atlanta Falcons in January 2007 but Miami was the only club that made an offer.\n\nBy the time Cameron arrived, the Dolphins were coming off the abrupt resignation of their head coach Nick Saban, despite repeatedly saying he would stay in Miami and denied rumors of him taking the Alabama head coaching job. His 2007 Dolphins lost 13 consecutive games to start the season, before beating the Baltimore Ravens in overtime on December 16 for their first and only win that season. The Dolphins ended the 2007 season in last place in the AFC East with a franchise-worst 1–15 record, the worst record in the NFL that year and the worst in the team's 40-year history. On January 3, 2008, newly hired general manager Jeff Ireland announced Cameron had been fired along with most of his staff.\n\nBaltimore Ravens\nOn January 23, 2008, Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh announced Cameron as the Ravens’ new offensive coordinator. Following a loss to the Washington Redskins in Week 14 of the 2012 NFL season, Cameron was released by the Ravens and replaced by Jim Caldwell. At the time of his release, he had helped the Ravens attain a 9–4 record.\n\nAfter Cameron's firing, the Ravens went on to win Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers. Despite being fired as offensive coordinator after week 14, head coach of the Ravens John Harbaugh stated that Cameron deserved and would receive a Super Bowl ring, having helped the team for a majority of the season to get to the playoffs.\n\nLSU\nOn February 8, 2013, it was reported on CBSSports.com that Cameron had accepted the offensive coordinator position at LSU, replacing Greg Studrawa. Later in the day this report was confirmed.\n\nEntering 2013, Cameron had immediate success, as his LSU offense averaged 46 points in the first six games of the regular season. The Tiger offense finished the season 34th in the country in passing yards at 265.1 per game, 32nd in rushing yards at 200.8, 22nd points for at 37.0, and 32nd in total offense (LSU's best since 2007) at 5591 yards of total offense and a total average of 465.9 yards per game. Cameron has also been widely praised for the development of redshirt senior quarterback Zach Mettenberger who had the best season of his LSU career with a 64.9% completion percentage, and a 22–8 touchdown to interception ratio, a notable improvement over past seasons. \n\nOn September 25, 2016, it was announced that Cameron was fired along with Les Miles after a 2–2 start to the season. Reports later indicated that it was incoming interim head coach Ed Orgeron who decided to release Cameron.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nCollege\n\nNFL\n\nReferences\n\n1961 births\nLiving people\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nBaltimore Ravens coaches\nIndiana Hoosiers football coaches\nIndiana Hoosiers football players\nLSU Tigers football coaches\nMiami Dolphins head coaches\nMichigan Wolverines football coaches\nNational Football League offensive coordinators\nSan Diego Chargers coaches\nWashington Redskins coaches\nSportspeople from Chapel Hill, North Carolina\nSportspeople from Terre Haute, Indiana\nCoaches of American football from Indiana\nPlayers of American football from Indiana"}

{"id": "4107129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture%20of%20New%20York%20City", "title": "Architecture of New York City", "text": "The building form most closely associated with New York City is the skyscraper, which has shifted many commercial and residential districts from low-rise to high-rise. Surrounded mostly by water, the city has amassed one of the largest and most varied collection of skyscrapers in the world.\n\nNew York has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. These include the Woolworth Building (1913), an early Gothic revival skyscraper with large-scale gothic architectural detail. The 1916 Zoning Resolution required setback in new buildings, and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below. The Art Deco design of the Chrysler Building (1930) and Empire State Building (1931), with their tapered tops and steel spires, reflected the zoning requirements. The Chrysler Building is considered by many historians and architects to be one of New York's finest, with its distinctive ornamentation such as V-shaped lighting inserts capped by a steel spire at the tower's crown. Early influential examples of the International Style in the United States are 330 West 42nd Street (1931) and the Seagram Building (1958). The Condé Nast Building (2000) is an important example of green design in American skyscrapers.\n\nThe character of New York's large residential districts is often defined by the elegant brownstone rowhouses, townhouses, and tenements that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1870 to 1930. In contrast, New York City also has neighborhoods that are less densely populated and feature free-standing dwellings. In the outer boroughs, large single-family homes are common in various architectural styles such as Tudor Revival and Victorian. Split two-family homes are also widely available across the outer boroughs, for example in the Flushing area.\n\nStone and brick became the city's building materials of choice after the construction of wood-frame houses was limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835. Unlike Paris, which for centuries was built from its own limestone bedrock, New York has always drawn its building stone from a far-flung network of quarries and its stone buildings have a variety of textures and hues. A distinctive feature of many of the city's buildings is the presence of wooden roof-mounted water towers. In the 19th century, the city required their installation on buildings higher than six stories to prevent the need for excessively high water pressures at lower elevations, which could burst municipal water pipes. Garden apartments became popular during the 1920s in outlying areas, including Jackson Heights in Queens, which became more accessible with expansion of the subway.\n\n\nConcentrations of buildings\n\nNew York has two main concentrations of high-rise buildings: Midtown Manhattan and Lower Manhattan, each with its own uniquely recognizable skyline. Midtown Manhattan, the largest central business district in the world, is home to such notable buildings as the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and Citigroup Center, as well as the Rockefeller Center complex. Lower Manhattan comprises the third largest central business district in the United States (after Midtown and Chicago's Loop). Lower Manhattan was characterized by the omnipresence of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center from its completion in 1973 until its destruction in the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Lower Manhattan saw reconstruction, which included One World Trade Center within the new World Trade Center complex. The Downtown skyline received new designs from such architects as Santiago Calatrava and Frank Gehry. In 2010, a , 43-story tower named 200 West Street was built for Goldman Sachs across the street from the World Trade Center site.\n\nNew York City has a long history of tall buildings. It has been home to 10 buildings that have held the world's tallest fully habitable building title at some point in history, although half have since been demolished. The first building to bring the world's tallest title to New York was the New York World Building, in 1890. Later, New York City was home to the world's tallest building for 75 continuous years, starting with the Park Row Building in 1899 and ending with One World Trade Center upon completion of the Sears Tower in 1974. The 1899 Park Row Building, one of the world's earliest skyscrapers, is still standing.\n\nThe high-rise buildings of Brooklyn constitute a third, much smaller skyline. Downtown Brooklyn is also experiencing an extensive building boom, with new high rise luxury residential towers, commercial space and a new arena in the planning stages. The building boom in Brooklyn has had a great deal of opposition from local civic and environmental groups which contend that Brooklyn needs to maintain its human scale. The borough of Queens has also been developing its own skyline in recent years with One Court Square (formerly the Citigroup Building, currently the tallest building in NYC outside Manhattan), and the Queens West development of several residential towers along the East River waterfront.\n\nThe 1916 Zoning Resolution required setback in new buildings, and restricted towers to a percentage of the lot size, to allow sunlight to reach the streets below.\n\nHistory\nThe skyscraper, which has shaped Manhattan's distinctive skyline, has been closely associated with New York City's identity since the end of the 19th century. From 1890 to 1973, the title of world's tallest building resided continually in Manhattan (with a gap between 1894 and 1908, when the title was held by Philadelphia City Hall), with eight different buildings holding the title. The New York World Building on Park Row, was the first to take the title in 1890, standing  until 1955, when it was demolished to construct a new ramp to the Brooklyn Bridge. The nearby Park Row Building, with its 29 stories standing  high, became the world's tallest office building when it opened in 1899.\n\nEarly 20th century\n\nThe 41-story Singer Building, constructed in 1908 as the headquarters of the eponymous sewing machine manufacturer, stood  high until 1967, when it became the tallest building ever demolished. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, standing  at the foot of Madison Avenue, wrested the title of world's tallest building in 1909, with a tower reminiscent of St Mark's Campanile in Venice. The Woolworth Building, and its distinctive Gothic architecture, took the title in 1913, topping off at . Structures such as the Equitable Building of 1915, which rises vertically forty stories from the sidewalk, prompted the passage of the 1916 Zoning Resolution, requiring new buildings to contain setbacks withdrawing progressively at a defined angle from the street as they rose, in order to preserve a view of the sky at street level.\n\nGrand Central Terminal is located in East Midtown close to the Chrysler Building. The railroad terminal, completed in 1913, is the third on its site. It was built in the Beaux-Arts style by the firms Reed and Stem and Warren and Wetmore. It became a National Historic Landmark in 1976.\n\nThe Roaring Twenties saw a race to the sky, with three separate buildings pursuing the world's tallest title in the span of a year. As the stock market soared in the days before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, two developers publicly competed for the crown. At , 40 Wall Street, completed in May 1930 in only eleven months as the headquarters of the Bank of Manhattan, seemed to have secured the title. At Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street, auto executive Walter Chrysler and his architect William Van Alen developed plans to build the structure's trademark  spire in secret, pushing the Chrysler Building to  and making it the tallest in the world when it was completed in 1929. Completed in 1930, the Chrysler Building is a distinctive symbol of New York. Originally built for the Chrysler Corporation, the building is presently co-owned by Aby Rosen's RFR Holding LLC, in a joint venture with the Austrian SIGNA Group. The Chrysler Building was the first structure in the world to surpass the 1,000 foot threshold.\n\nBoth buildings were soon surpassed with the May 1931 completion of the 102-story Empire State Building with its tower reaching  at the top of the building. The  high pinnacle was later added bringing the total height of the building to . The Empire State Building, a contemporary Art Deco style building in Midtown Manhattan, was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon and takes its name from the nickname of New York State. It was the first building to go beyond the 100-story mark, and has one of the world's most visited observation decks, which sees about 4 million visitors a year. The building was built in just 14 months.\n30 Rockefeller Plaza is a slim Art Deco skyscraper and the focal point of Rockefeller Center. It stands 850 ft (259 m) with 70 floors. Built in 1933 and originally called the RCA Building, it was later called the Comcast Building. The frieze above the main entrance was executed by Lee Lawrie and depicts Wisdom, along with a phrase from scripture that reads \"Wisdom and Knowledge shall be the stability of thy times\", originally found in the Book of Isaiah, 33:6.\n\n330 West 42nd Street (1931) was the only skyscraper in New York City displayed in Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson's influential International Style exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1932, and the only other U.S. skyscraper at that exhibition, besides the PSFS Building. Johnson, along with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, later helped build the Seagram Building (1959) on Park Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets, with extruded bronze mullions on the facade. Paul Goldberger wrote in The New York Times in 1976 that the Seagram Building was one of \"New York's most copied buildings\", its design having been copied in several structures worldwide.\n\nLate 20th century\n\nIn 1961, the Pennsylvania Railroad unveiled plans to tear down the old Penn Station and replace it with a new Madison Square Garden and office building complex. Organized protests were aimed at preserving the McKim, Mead & White-designed structure completed in 1910, widely considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style and one of the architectural jewels of New York City. Despite these efforts, demolition of the structure began in October 1963. The loss of Penn Station—called \"an act of irresponsible public vandalism\" by historian Lewis Mumford—led directly to the enactment in 1965 of a local law establishing the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which is responsible for preserving the \"city's historic, aesthetic, and cultural heritage\". The historic preservation movement triggered by Penn Station's demise has been credited with the retention of some one million structures nationwide, including over 1,000 in New York City. In 2017, a multibillion-dollar rebuilding plan was unveiled to restore the historic grandeur of Penn Station, in the process of upgrading the landmark's status as a critical transportation hub.\n\nThe MetLife Building, formerly the Pan Am Building, was the largest commercial office building in the world when it opened on March 7, 1963. It stands directly north of Grand Central Terminal.\nThe former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center were located in Lower Manhattan. At , the 110-story buildings were the world's tallest from 1972 until they were surpassed by the construction of the Willis Tower in 1974 (formerly known as the Sears Tower, located in Chicago). One World Trade Center, a replacement for the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, is currently the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nCitigroup Center is a 59-story office tower located at 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. It is considered one of the most important post-war skyscrapers to be in erected in New York City. The striking design of the steeply slanted roof, the sleek aluminum-clad facade, and its base on four stilts over a church also on the site made the skyscraper an instant architectural icon. The sloping roof houses the building's mechanical and ventilation systems. The designers settled on an aluminum-clad facade to reduce the weight load on the building's foundation and support structures, since its entire weight would be supported by stilts. To prevent swaying, a \"tuned mass damper\" was later added on the roof.\n\n21st century\n\nTime Warner Center is a mixed-use skyscraper at Columbus Circle on Manhattan's Upper West Side. It was the first major building to be completed since the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe Condé Nast Building, officially Four Times Square, is a modern skyscraper in Times Square in Midtown Manhattan and one of the most important examples of green design in skyscrapers in the United States. Environmentally friendly gas-fired absorption chillers, along with a high-performing insulating and shading curtain wall, ensure that the building does not need to be heated or cooled for the majority of the year. Office furniture is made with biodegradable and non-toxic materials. The air-delivery system provides 50% more fresh air than is required by New York City Building Code, and a number of recycling chutes serve the entire building. Being the first project of its size to undertake these features in construction, the building has received an award from the American Institute of Architects, as well as AIA New York State.\n\nHearst Tower, located in Midtown Manhattan at 300 West 57th Street, is another example of the new breed of green design skyscrapers in New York City. Hearst Tower is a glass and steel construction skyscraper which rests on the base of the original 1920s Hearst Corporation Building. Hearst Tower is easily identified by the dramatic interlocking triangular glass panels designed by British architect Lord Norman Foster. Hearst Tower is also the first skyscraper in New York City to be awarded the coveted Gold LEED Certified rating by the United States Green Building Council.\n\nDemolished buildings\n\nTallest buildings\n\nThe 15 tallest standard structures, which include those with the 10 highest antennae or radio towers (pinnacles)\n\n† (constructed as the Cities Service Company Building)\n‡ (constructed as the Bank of Manhattan Trust Corporation Building)\n All addresses are in Midtown Manhattan except those in lighter shades, which are in Lower Manhattan.\n\nResidential architecture\n\nAs New York City grew, it spread outward from where it originally began at the southern-tip of Manhattan Island into surrounding areas. In order to house the burgeoning population, farm land and open space in Upper Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island were developed into neighborhoods of brownstones, apartment buildings, multi-family and single-family homes. The density of this new construction generally depended on the area's proximity and accessibility to Manhattan.\n\nThe development of these areas was often spurred by the opening of bridges and the connection of boroughs via public transportation. For example, the Brooklyn Bridge was completed in 1883 and connects Brooklyn and Manhattan across the East River. Brooklyn Heights, a nabe on the Brooklyn waterfront, is often credited as the United States' first suburb. The bridge allowed an easier commute between Brooklyn and Manhattan and spurred rapid construction, development, and redevelopment. The Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, completed in 1964, opened up many areas of Staten Island to residential and commercial development, especially in the central and southern parts of the borough, which had previously been largely undeveloped. Staten Island's population doubled from about 221,000 in 1960 to about 443,000 in 2000.\n\nBy 1870, stone and brick had become firmly established as the building materials of choice, as the construction of wood-frame houses had been greatly limited in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1835. Unlike Paris, which for centuries was built from its own limestone bedrock, New York has always drawn its building stone from a network of quarries, sometimes quite distant, which is evident in the variety of textures and hues of stone seen in the city's buildings. In the days before rail, stones were floated down the Hudson River or along the Atlantic Seaboard from pits in New England. While trains brought marble from Vermont and granite from Minnesota, it was Connecticut brownstone that was so popular in the construction of New York's row homes in the late 19th century that the term brownstone became synonymous with row house.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, public housing projects dramatically changed the city's appearance. New, large scale (frequently high-rise) residential complexes replaced older communities, at times removing artifacts and landmarks that would now be considered of historic value. During this period, many of these new projects were built in an effort towards urban renewal championed by the famed urban planner Robert Moses. The resulting housing projects have suffered from inconsistent funding, poor maintenance, and high crime, prompting many to consider these projects a failure.\n\nA distinctive feature of residential (and many commercial) buildings in New York City is the presence of wooden roof-mounted water towers, which were required on all buildings higher than six stories by city ordinance in the 19th century because the municipal water pipes could not withstand the extraordinarily high pressure necessary to deliver water to the top stories of high-rise buildings.\n\nBridges and tunnels\n\nNew York City is located on one of the world's largest natural harbors. The boroughs of Manhattan and Staten Island are their own islands, while Queens and Brooklyn are located at the west-end of the larger Long Island. This precipitates a need for an extensive infrastructure of bridges and tunnels. Nearly all of the city's major bridges and several of its tunnels, have broken or set records. For example, the Holland Tunnel was the world's first vehicular tunnel when it opened in 1927.\n\nThe Queensboro Bridge is an important piece of cantilever architecture. The towers of the Brooklyn Bridge are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement. Their architectural style is neo-Gothic, with characteristic pointed arches above the passageways through the stone towers. This bridge was also the longest suspension bridge in the world from its opening until 1903, and the first steel-wire suspension bridge. The Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism.\n\nStreet grid\n\nFormulated in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, New York adopted a visionary proposal to develop Manhattan north of 14th Street with a regular street grid. The economic logic underlying the plan, which called for twelve numbered avenues running north and south, and 155 orthogonal cross streets, was that the grid's regularity would provide an efficient means to develop new real estate property. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park, disapproved.\n\nSee also\n\nList of buildings\nList of National Historic Landmarks in New York\nList of New York City Designated Landmarks\nList of tallest buildings in New York City\nList of cities with most skyscrapers\nArt Deco architecture of New York City\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n Federal Writers' Project (1939).

It is one of eight suffragan dioceses in the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Armagh. The See is vacant; Bishop Donal McKeown (Bishop of Derry) is currently the Apostolic Administrator pending the appointment of a new bishop.\n\nTerritorial remit\nThe territorial remit of the diocese includes much of counties Antrim and Down, including the cities of Belfast and Lisburn and the large towns Antrim, Ballymena, Bangor, Carrickfergus, Downpatrick, Holywood, Larne and Newtownards. The population of the diocese is about one million, of which approximately 30% are Roman Catholic with Sunday mass attendance estimated at 20%. There are currently 88 parishes and ministries in the diocese served by fewer than 100 priests, though the significance of individual parishes has been overtaken by the development of 'pastoral communities'. The diocese is Ireland's second largest in terms of population (after the Archdiocese of Dublin).\n\nHistory\nSt Fergus (died 583) is named as first Bishop of Down. The Diocese of Connor was founded in 480 by St Macnissi, and St Malachy was bishop there (1124). The dioceses of Down and Connor were permanently joined in 1439.\n\nIn 1670, as an effect of the Reformation, wars, and penal laws, in the whole of Down and Connor there were only 2,500 Catholic families. When at length the pressure of penal legislation was removed Catholicism revived rapidly.\n\nIn the period 1810–1840, a period of relaxation of the penal laws culminating in Catholic Emancipation, an estimated forty new churches were built. The progress thus made under William Crolly (1825–1835) and Cornelius Denvir (1835–65) was continued, as Belfast expanded as a city, under Patrick Dorrian (1865–86) and Patrick MacAlister (1886–95) and Henry Henry (1895–1908).\n\nDiocesan statistics\n Number of Catholics = 329,243\n Number of parishes = 86 \n Number of churches = 151\n Number of priests in diocesan ministry = 131\n Number of permanent deacons in ministry (2018) = 9\n Number ordained (2018) = 1\n Number of retired priests = 44\n Seminarians = 8 \n Number of brothers = 30\n Number of sisters = 243\n St. Mary's College of Education on roll = 994\n Number of primary & nursery schools = 164 (on roll = 32,306)\n Number of grammar schools = 12 (on roll = 10,795)\n Number of secondary school = 31 (on roll = 15,621)\n Baptisms = 4,096 \n First communions = 4,740 \n Confirmations = 5,207 \n Marriages = 1,250\n\n(The Down and Connor Directory)\n\nCity parishes\nListed are city parishes listed by the Diocese of Down and Connor.\n\n St Peter's Cathedral, Belfast\n St Patrick's Church, Belfast / Pro-Cathedral, Donegall Street, Belfast\n Christ the Redeemer, Lagmore\n Corpus Christi, Ballymurphy, Belfast\n St. Patrick's, Derriaghy\n Drumbo & Carryduff\n Hannahstown\n Holy Cross, Ardoyne\n Holy Family, Newington\n Holy Rosary, Ormeau Road\n Holy Trinity, Turf Lodge\n Loughshore - Three parishes: St Mary’s Greencastle, County Antrim, Star of The Sea Whitehouse, County Antrim and St James’, Whiteabbey\n Nativity, Poleglass\n Our Lady Queen of Peace, Kilwee\n Sacred Heart, Glenview Street, Oldpark Road, Belfast\n St Agnes', Andersonstown Road, Belfast\n St Anne's, Kingsway/Upper Lisburn Road, Belfast\n St Anthony's, Willowfield, Woodstock Road, Belfast\n St Bernadette's, Rosetta Road, Castlereagh\n St Brigid's, Malone Road, Belfast\n St Colmcille's, Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast\n St Gerard's, Antrim Road, Belfast\n St John's, Falls Road, Belfast\n St Luke's, Twinbrook\n St Malachy's, Alfred Street, Belfast\n St Mary's, Chapel Lane, Belfast\n St Mary's-On-The-Hill, Glengormley\n St Matthew's, Bryson Street, Belfast\n St Michael The Archangel, Finaghy Road North, Belfast\n St Oliver Plunkett, Glenveagh Drive, Glen Road, Belfast\n St Paul's, Falls Road, Belfast\n St Teresa's, Glen Road, Belfast\n St. Therese of Lisieux, Somerton Road, Belfast\n St Vincent De Paul, Ligoniel\n\nCountry parishes \nListed are country parishes listed by the Diocese of Down and Connor.\n\n Aghagallon & Ballinderry (St Patrick's)\n Ahoghill (St Marys Church; Ballynafie Road, Ahoghill)\n Antrim (St Comgall's and St Joseph's)\n Armoy (St. Olcan's)\n Ballintoy (St Mary's and St Joseph's)\n Ballycastle (St Patrick's & St Brigid's) \n Ballyclare & Ballygowan (Sacred Heart)\n Ballygalget (St Patrick's Church)\n Ballymena/Kirkinriola (All Saints and St Patrick's)\n Ballymoney & Derrykeighan (Our Lady & St Patrick's)\n Bangor (St Comgall's, Bangor; Most Holy Redeemer, Ballyholme; St Comgall's, Donaghadee)\n Carnlough (St John the Evangelist)\n Carrickfergus (St Nicholas')\n Castlewellan (under the patronage of St Malachy]\n Coleraine\n Crossgar\n Culfeightrin (Ballyvoy)\n Cushendall (St Patrick's) & Cushendun (St Patrick's, Craigagh & St Mary's \"Star of the Sea\", Culraney)\n Downpatrick (St Patrick’s, Downpatrick; St Malachy’s, Ballykilbeg; St Brigid’s, Rathkeltair; St Colmcille’s)\n Drumaroad & Clanvaraghan (St John the Baptist; Our Lady of the Angels)\n Dundrum & Tyrella\n Duneane (Moneyglass & Toome)\n Dunloy & Cloughmills\n Dunsford & Ardglass (St Nicholas’, Ardglass; St Mary’s, Dunsford)\n Glenariff\n Glenarm\n Glenavy & Killead \n Glenravel & The Braid\n Holywood\n Kilcoo (St Malachy’s)\n Killough (St Patrick’s, Legamaddy; St Joseph’s, Killough; Star of the Sea, Rossglass)\n Killyleagh\n Kircubbin\n Larne\n Lisburn (under the patronage of St Patrick) \n Loughguile \n Loughinisland (St Macartan’s)\n Lower Mourne\n Newcastle/Maghera (Our Lady of the Assumption, Newcastle; St Patrick's, Bryansford)\n Newtownards & Comber (St Patrick's Newtownards; Our Lady of the Visitation, Comber)\n Portaferry (St Patrick’s, Ballyphilip;  St Cooey’s, Portaferry)\n Portglenone (Blessed Virgin Mary Immaculate)\n Portrush (St Patrick's)\n Portstewart (St Mary's Star of the Sea)\n Randalstown (St MacNissi's)\n Rasharkin (St Mary's)\n Saintfield & Carrickmannon\n Saul & Ballee (St Patrick's, Saul; St Joseph's, Downpatrick; St Tassach's, Carlin)\n Strangford (Star of the Sea)\nUpper Mourne\n\nAd limina visit 2006 \nBishop Patrick Walsh, Bishop Anthony Farquhar and Bishop Donal McKeown met with Pope Benedict XVI on the first morning of their visit.

Founded by Basil Harwood in 1896 to further the music of J. S. Bach in Oxford, the Choir merged in 1905 with the Oxford Choral & Philharmonic Society, whose origins can be traced back to 1819. Oxford Bach Choir therefore has a choral tradition which extends back over two centuries. The choir performs most of its concerts in the Sheldonian Theatre (designed by Christopher Wren) in central Oxford, but also performs in St John the Evangelist Church, Oxford, located on the Iffley Road.\n\nOverview\nThe Oxford Bach Choir is a large mixed-voice choir, with around 120 members. The range of music covered is diverse, from the works of Bach and the classical repertoire to contemporary works. Oxford Bach Choir has always had a mix of town and gown singers. Rehearsals and concerts are scheduled so that students, academics and professionals are all able to participate in the choir's programmes. The choir enjoys good relationships both with Oxford colleges and with businesses in the city. New members, drawn from throughout Oxfordshire and adjacent counties, are encouraged to apply to join the choir at the start of each term.\n\nOxford Bach Choir gives at least three concerts every season, at the end of each academic term in December, March and June, occasions that attract audiences of up to 800 people. It also gives a carol concert each December in the Sheldonian Theatre, most recently in association with Oxfordshire Young Singers, Oxfordshire County Youth Choir and Oxfordshire Youth Brass Ensemble.\n\nFor its main concerts the choir is regularly accompanied by a top professional orchestras, such as the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Mozart Players and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.\n\nIn 2018 the choir appointed a new principal conductor, Benjamin Nicholas, who is also director of music at Merton College, Oxford. \n\nRecordings have been made of some of the concerts performed by the choir.\n\nConductors\n Basil Harwood (1896-1901)\n Hugh Allen (1901-26)\n William Henry Harris (1926–33)\n Thomas Armstrong (1934–55)\n Sydney Watson (1955–70)\n Jack Westrup (1970–71)\n Simon Preston (1971–74)\n Edward Olleson (1975–77)\n Christopher Robinson (1977–97)\n Nicholas Cleobury (1997–2015)\n David Crown (2016–17)\n Benjamin Nicholas (2018-)\n\nNotable members\nAdrian Boult - English conductor who established the BBC Symphony Orchestra and became the principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\nVera Brittain - Writer, pacifist and feminist.

{"id": "4107160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonggi%20Academy%20of%20Foreign%20Languages", "title": "Gyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages", "text": "Gyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages, or GAFL (경기외국어고등학교, 京畿外國語高等學校) is a foreign language high school located in Uiwang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea. It is equipped with two student dormitories, each for different genders,\nwith its own dormitory inspectors as staff. Students are divided into eight classes per grade by language (English & Japanese, English & Chinese, Japanese, and Chinese) in which they would like to major. It was originally established under the name of Myongji Foreign Language High School on March 2, 2004, by Myongji Foundation. It was run as Myongji Foreign Language High School for 5 years, but due to declining financial situation of Myongji Foundation, the school was taken over by Bong-ahm Institute in 2008. Consequently, Bong-ahm Institute changed the name of the school to the current name of Gyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages, with changes in various areas, including the principal, school uniform, dormitory inspectors and operation of school cafeteria. Although it kept the original subjects, or \"majors\", GAFL's international department changed the curriculum of its international curriculum department to\nInternational Baccalaureate Diploma Programme in 2011, making GAFL the first Korean high school to adopt the program. Currently, there are nine years worth of graduates, with alumni spread over diverse universities, including domestically prominent SKY (universities) and various universities abroad. The school is also well known for its high tuition fee, always being in the top 10 schools by tuition fee.\n\nTimeline\n\nHistory\n\nFounding \nBefore the founding of the school, the school properties belong to a private high school, Jung-won High School, founded in 1989, but was bought by the Myeonji Education Foundation and was demolished of its establishment. After, the Myeongji Education Foundation intended to establish a new school, that of a Foreign Language High School (), where under Korean government plan was a special type of school to educate students with high level of foreign languages. As Myeongji Education Foundation was already in possession of various schools including Myongji University, the school quickly gained recognition among the high competition between Foreign Language High Schools.\n\nMyongji Foreign Language High School Era\nMyongji Foreign Language High School was a dormitory-based foreign language high school that accepted students from all over the country, mainly through its individual and unique admission tests. The students lived in the dormitory, and studied at night under the supervision of the dormitory inspectors, who were outsourced by the school. Remaining at school on weekends and during vacation was optional, but students had to follow a strict timetable that regulated activities most of the time. In the absence of school teachers, the dorm inspectors would take the place of chaperoning the students and their activities. To accommodate the students' needs, there were various facilities such as laundry room, gym, and a 7-Eleven convenience store (which was rumored to be the second highest branch in sales throughout all of South Korea) inside the school. The academic performance of Myongji students steadily improved over time, peaking at the 3rd highest in 2011 College Scholastic Ability Test in all of South Korea.\n\nGyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages: former era (until 6th generation)\nMyeongji Education Foundation faced a financial crisis during its attempt of expanding the business, hence was forced to handover the right to management of the school. This right was purchased by Daekyo Education Foundation, owned by Korea's prominent education company Daekyo (), and changing the present name, Gyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages. With the conversion of the school into Gyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages, the school took a drastic turn. In admissions, it could no longer test applying students in maths, and had to take into account their middle school grades to a larger extent due to change of government regulations. The school uniform also changed, from the previous 2 versions (winter and summer) to 3 versions (winter formal and casual, and summer). The school also scouted Hashik Park, a former vice-principal of Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies and Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies to be GAFL's new principal. Under Principal Park's running of the school, GAFL developed various student clubs, including a club pertaining to lacrosse. In terms of dormitory, staffing change was made in dormitory inspectors; the school hired a new group of dormitory inspectors that were regarded as a lot less strict than the group before. Amenities such as towels and laundry service were also made free to the students. However, the 6th generation of students still followed much of the same curriculum and education infrastructure as previous generations of students did.\n\nGyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages: latter era (7th generation ~)\nFrom this time period, the school took even more of a drastic turn. It could no longer accept students from provinces other than Gyeonggi due to change in government regulations. However, it was accepted to incorporate the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, one of the first Korean high schools to do so. This entailed a change of system and infrastructure for the students; as opposed to the past, the subjects, or \"majors\" were now divided into four categories containing local English, international English (IBDP), Chinese and Japanese departments.\n\nSymbols\n\nAlma mater song \nThe schools alma mater song was written by the chairman of the Daekyo Education Foundation Young-jung Kang, where most of the lyrics are in Korean, but few phrases in English.\n\nSchool symbols \nThe school chaplain of GAFL is the Zelkova serrate, which was chosen for its characteristics of an often used a shading plant in Korea. This was to symbolise the purpose of the schools value; educating the youth as the servant of the people.\n\nAlong with Zelkova, the flower was a Camellia lutchuensis, a symbol of strength as the Camellia endures the winters, and the floriography in Korea being humble heart, to symbolise the students of their strength endure through hard times, yet remembering the value of humbleness.\n\nThe school bird is a Phoenix (mythology), or 봉황 in Korean. To symbolise the everlasting sprit of the school. Because of this, the school board of parent donate a pair of Peafowl, which was kept within the school campus. Phoenix is discoverable in the coat of arms of the school and throughout the school logos etc.\n\nDepartments of Major Languages\nIn both Myongji Foreign Language High School and GAFL, students were divided into classes centered around certain \"majors\", which meant that the classes pertaining to that major would receive more education on that area. Traditionally, there were 2 classes for each major, and these majors acted as major factors in school management and student activities by providing a clear boundary between groups of students.\n\nMyongji Foreign Language High School\nIn Myongji Foreign Language High School, there were four majors: English (major) and Chinese (minor), English (major) and Japanese (minor), Chinese and Japanese. Each department received differentiated education according to the majors, including conversation and theoretical classes. The number of classes pertaining to the language was designed to escalate as the grades increased; such was the case that 3rd grade students had 5 different subjects pertaining to their major, for instance, English Writing, English Conversation, English Grammar, English Reading and English Listening. As students wishing for acceptance in foreign universities were few in number, they were incorporated into the main system, but could take optional classes and guidance on the side.\n\nGyeonggi Academy of Foreign Languages\nGAFL was approved as World IB School in 2011, and unlike other IB schools in Korea, it is the only IB school where students can graduate with both IB Diploma and a Korean High School Diploma.\n\nWith the introduction of IBDP to the school, the major system also changed. The previously few students striving for foreign universities were promoted to a new major (international English), and the students striving for domestic universities were incorporated into local English courses. The IBDP is currently designed to address to the international English portion of the students.\n\nEnglish-Chinese Department \nThis is were English is the major language and Chinese is the minor language. The symbolic colour of the English-Chinese department is blue. This is the department were it constitutes the majority of the English department. Because of this factor, they have the slight advantage in determining the Korean High school GPA, which is relatively marked.\n\nEnglish-Japanese Department \nBeing only a size of one class, is the smallest department of the school. Having red as their symbolic colour. In the administrative system, often English-Japanese Department is categorised a one department with the International (IB) Department, but in terms of actual educational curriculum is completely independent from the International Department.\n\nChinese Department \nBeing represented with the colour black, the Chinese department majors in Chinese and English as a minor language. Chinese department is often associated with outgoing, strong images, specially showing a culture of strong bonds between the freshmen and the sophomore class. There are significant number of students in the Chinese department who move on to prominent Chinese or Taiwanese universities such Beijing University, Tsinghua University, National Taipei University.\n\nJapanese Department \nBeing represented with the colour white, along with the Chinese department, the Japanese department is one of the biggest department and majors Japanese. Japanese department is often portrayed as the rival of the Chinese department, showing a very calm, and diligent image. Similarly, some students continue their academic in prestigious Japanese universities like University of Tokyo, Keio University, Waseda University.\n\nInternational (IB Diploma Programme) Department \nBeing the smallest, yet the most support department of the school, International Department is the newest department of GAFL. Unlike most international schools in Korea, instead of adopting the SAT, or the Advanced Placement, has adopted the IB Diploma Programme for the first time as a Korean High school. Due to their different in curriculum, the International Department is granted of more independence and autonomy within the school. As the IB programme is constituted with 2 years, but the Korean High school system of 3 years, freshmen of International Department is enrolled in a Pre-DP curriculum provided by the school itself.\n\nUnlike other departments where the minor language is fixed, the International department provides both Japanese and Chinese as minor language.\n\nOffered Courses \nAs a Foreign Languages Highschool, IB students in GAFL are required to take 3 language courses within Group 1: Studies in Language and Literature and Group 2: Language acquisition. Thus students drop their Group 6: The Arts course at the end of DP1, and it is not included in final exam as well.\n\nCourses offered:\n\nGroup 1: Korean Literature A (SL/HL), English Language and Literature A (HL)\n\nGroup 2: English B (HL), Chinese B (SL), Japanese B (SL)\n\nGroup 3: History (SL/HL), Economy (SL/HL)\n\nGroup 4: Biology (SL/HL), Chemistry (SL/HL)\n\nGroup 5: Mathematics Analysis and Approach (SL/HL)\n\nGroup 6: Film (SL), Theatre (SL)\n\nStudent Life\n\nUniform \nBeing complete re-designed in 2008, GAFL's uniform exist in different forms. Largely into three categories that of Spring-autumn, summer, winter uniform.\n\nWinter uniform includes a jacket, coat, vest, shirt, tie, cardigan, trousers, skirts for female students. The Spring-autumn uniform with a jumper, vest, shirt, trousers, tie, and skirts for female students. The summer uniform is worn with shirt with short sleeves, trousers, shorts, and skirts and ribbons for female students.\n\nAlong with seasonal differentiation, there are two types of uniform, that of formal and casual. Students may were what ever kind of uniform they choose, but on Fridays, it is mandatory that students dress in their formal uniform, including the jacket and with black dress shoes.\n\nThere are unofficial uniforms of the school that students wear, usually being the baseball jackets. Students often wear baseball jackets over their uniform to show their affiliation with the prefect committee, or society they belong to. There are no particular school codes on these jackets, but through tradition, it is only the prefect committees, societies that existed from the founding of the school, and sports society that wear them. There are few exception to this.\n\nPrefects \nThe school's prefect system imitates that of a democratic government, meaning there is the legislative, executive, and judiciary branch. The legislative branch is formed with each classes president and vice president, led by a chairman elected among them and has the right to amend the school codes. The executive branch is led by the School president voted through a vote as the school in whole, and the president chooses members of the executive branch that carries out all school actives. The judiciary branch is chosen by interviews conducted by the previous members of the judiciary. They have the right to hand out demerit marks to students according to the school codes.\n\nThe international department gets the exception and is allowed to form the International department committee, led by chairman elected within the department. The international department committee is only formed with student of the international department and gains autonomy to the prefect system of three branches.\n\nSocieties \nAs the school is a Foreign Language High school, the societies are more concentrated into languages, and humanities. There are more than 100 societies in the school which is formed, and led by the students, answering to the executive branch. There are no official division between the societies of the school, but there is what the students traditionally call the 'classic societies', like the Law society, Debate society, United Nations society, English society, and Economic society, which refer to about 12 societies that existed from the founding of the school. These societies tend to be large in number, financial support from school, and gets more opportunities to host a competition, or an event.\n\nBesides the academic societies, there are numerous sports and art societies. The major sport society is football, basketball, and lacrosse. Sport societies usually participate in high school leagues held among prestigious private schools as varsity teams. The art society include orchestra, band, hip-hop, and painting societies. Art societies annually hosts a festival where they put up plays, drama, performances for the students.\n\nCampus Facilities and Buildings\n\nMain Hall \nBeing reused from the old building of the Jung-won High school, the Main halls is older than the school itself. This is where all of the class rooms are located except for the International department, along with most of the teachers' offices. On the ground floor of the Main hall is where the cafeteria is located where three meals a day is provided by the school including weekends. On the 1st floor is the School Memorial Hall, a place to remember and value the history of the school.\n\nBong-am Hall \nBong-am, being named after the school boards first chairman, Young-jung Kang, is the building that includes the school's convenience store, large studying hall, separate group seminar rooms, and an indoor basketball court, often used as a gather hall for school events.\n\nCreation Hall \nCreation hall, the first dormitory building of the school, is a 10 floor building located at the corner of the school's campus. When Creation hall was the only dormitory of the school, it accommodated both male and female students. However, due to its aging facilities of shower room, and air conditioning, the school later decides to build another dormitory building, and Creation hall only accommodating the male students from then. On the top floor of Creation hall locates a self-study area opened until 4 am, and an student lounge where students call eat, drink and relax as the dormitory codes prohibit consumption of food within each rooms.\n\nVision Hall \nVision hall is the newly built dormitory building with better facilities than Creation hall, accommodating the female students. Vision hall has total of 9 floors located right next to Creation hall. Vision hall is where the dean's night office is located on the ground floor, and has a garden at the rooftop, where the school holds annual event from time to time. In the basement of Vision hall is the laundry room, where the school provide free laundry service to students where they only have to pick their clothes up after school.\n\nGlobal Hall \nAs recognisable from the name itself, the Global hall is the building where the international department is located. Because of this independent facility, the international department can use 12 classrooms, 1 teacher's office, 1 biology lab, 1 chemistry lab, film studio, theatre room, and 3 self study areas and a library. This is the first building that visitors see when entering through the school's main gate.\n\nServant Leadership Hall \nLocated in front of the Global Hall, Servant Leadership Hall is the newest building on campus, having the construction finished in 2021. This building is formed with 5 floor, having multiple classrooms, media room, and a gym on ground floor for the students use. This building was built to solve an old dissatisfaction of the students and faculty for the lack of teaching space. This building, due to the locational benefit, is mostly used by the international department, but also is used for multiple uses such as society activities.\n\nGAFL Ground \nGAFL Ground is the name for the indoor sports facilities located at the very north-west of the campus. Below the GAFL Ground is a parking lot used by the faculty, and above is the actual sports facilities. The sports facilities include 4 indoor badminton court, and two futsal fields, which is often used as a lacrosse field for the school's varsity team.\n\nThe Pathway \nThis is a distinct feature of the school's campus. The Pathway refers to the one singular indoor hallway that allows the students to navigate to all of the school's building. The Global hall is connected to the Servant Leadership Hall using a bridge, to the Vision hall by an underground pathway, the Creation hall through a roofed alley, and indoor hallway continuing all the way to the Main Hall. For this reason, no body uses an umbrella in the school.\n\nReferences\n\nLanguage high schools in South Korea\nSchools in Gyeonggi Province\nEducational institutions established in 2004\n2004 establishments in South Korea\nPrivate schools in South Korea"}

{"id": "4107170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding%20Giants", "title": "Riding Giants", "text": "Riding Giants is a 2004 documentary film produced by Agi Orsi and directed and narrated by Stacy Peralta, a famous skater/surfer. The movie traces the origins of surfing and specifically focuses on the art of big wave riding. Some of the featured surfers are Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton, and Jeff Clark, and surfing pioneers such as Mickey Munoz.\n\nSynopsis\nThe film begins with a historical overview, starting at its Hawaiian beginnings, then moves on to focus on the dangerous lure of big-wave surfing (surfing waves that can reach up to ). The documentary chronicles the evolution of riding at Hawaii's Waimea Bay in the 1950s, the revolution of lighter boards, and tow-in surfing to allow for \"riding giants\". Three surfers who are part of this multi-generational evolution are spotlighted: Greg Noll is shown as a fearless big wave rider during the 1950s and 1960s; Jeff Clark who discovered Mavericks in Northern California and surfed there alone for years; and Laird Hamilton, the contemporary surfer who brings tow-in riding to the limelight.\n\nProduction\nPeralta previously directed the acclaimed documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys, which documented the rise of skateboarding, of which he was an integral part. The French producer Franck Marty, along with his partners, chose him to direct a new breed of big wave riding documentary film. He has said that the primary purpose of making a surfing documentary was that he \"wanted to see a film like this\", and that he hoped it helped to answer the question \"why people choose to devote their entire lives to the pursuit of riding waves.\"\n\nRiding Giants utilizes stills, archive footage, \"re-enacted\" footage, home movies, and interviews. Some of the surfers interviewed include Jeff Clark, Laird Hamilton, Dave Kalama, Gerry Lopez, Greg Noll, Kelly Slater and Peter Mel.\n\nSoundtrack music\nIncludes: Basement Jaxx, David Bowie, Link Wray, Dick Dale, Doves, Fila Brazillia, Bill Haley & His Comets, The Hives, Linkin Park, John Mayall, Moby, Pearl Jam, The Ruts, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Soundgarden, The Stray Cats, Alice in Chains, Érik Satie and The Waterboys.\n\nReception\nRiding Giants was the first documentary film to open the Sundance Film Festival. It won the 2004 A.C.E. Eddie Award for Best Edited Documentary by editor Paul Crowder. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 92% fresh rating, having earned mostly positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert said in his review, \"Before seeing Riding Giants, my ideas about surfing were formed by the Gidget movies, Endless Summer, The Beach Boys, Elvis and lots of TV commercials. Riding Giants is about altogether another reality.\"\n\nSee also\n Step into Liquid\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n\n2004 films\n2004 documentary films\nFrench documentary films\n2000s English-language films\nBig wave surfing\nFilms set in Hawaii\nDocumentary films about surfing\nStudioCanal films\nDocumentary films about Hawaii\nAmerican surfing films\nSony Pictures Classics films\nAmerican sports documentary films\n2000s American films\n2000s French films"}

Their common name is rocket frogs, but this name may refer to frogs in other genera and families, following the taxonomic revision of the genus in 2006.\n\nTaxonomy\nFormerly, the genus Colostethus was found to be \"rampantly nonmonophyletic\" in the taxonomic revision of poison dart frogs published in 2006. Before the revision, it had 138 species, but this was reduced to 18 species, after species of the former Colostethus were distributed among eight genera in two families, that is, in Dendrobatidae and in the newly established family Aromobatidae (e..g., Anomaloglossus). Within Dendrobatidae, many former Colostethus species were moved to Hyloxalus, while three were moved to the new genus Silverstoneia. Nevertheless, Colostethus is still considered paraphyletic because some Colostethus are more closely related to Ameerega than to other Colostethus.\n\nDescription\nDorsal colouration is cryptic, brown. A pale oblique lateral stripe is present (but may be broken or incomplete). Dorsal skin is granular posteriorly.

Strangway was the founder, first President and first Chancellor of Quest University Canada, a private non-profit liberal arts and sciences university in Squamish, British Columbia which opened in September 2007. He was President Emeritus of the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia.\n\nEarly life and education\nStrangway was born in 1934 in Simcoe, Ontario. He studied at the University of Toronto, earning a B.A. in Physics and Geology in 1956, an M.A. in physics and a Ph.D in physics in 1960.\n\nCareer\nStrangway began his teaching career as an Assistant Professor of Geology at the University of Colorado between 1961-64. In 1965, he joined M.I.T for three years as both an Assistant Professor of Geophysics and Researcher. In 1970, he joined NASA as the Chief of the Geophysics Branch and was responsible for the geophysical aspects of the Apollo missions. In 1972, he was awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for his scientific contribution to NASA. As Chief of NASA's Geophysics Branch, David Strangway designed lunar experiments for Apollo astronauts and also was involved in the examination of returned Moon rocks that contributed to the further knowledge of the Solar System. Strangway is the author or co-author of more than 165 research papers, including results of lunar sample studies and experiments. Strangway's research focused extensively on magnetic studies and electromagnetic sounding, both terrestrially for exploration and mapping and in lunar mapping and exploration.  Since 1971 he has served on a great number of scientific and academic committees on behalf of governmental or private sector organizations. In 1973 he served as the director of the Lunar Science Institute (later renamed the Lunar and Planetary Institute in 1977).\n\nHe was a vice-president at the University of Toronto and the chairman of its Geology Department from 1973 to 1983. Upon the retirement of James Ham in 1983, Strangway was appointed the acting president of the University of Toronto. He was elevated to become the University's eleventh President after the designated successor, Donald Forster, suddenly died of a heart attack in August of that year.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1997, he was the tenth President of the University of British Columbia. He provided the direction and impetus that enabled the large, publicly funded University of British Columbia to achieve world-class status during his 12 years as President. This was enhanced by leading what was at the time, Canada's largest fund-raising campaign and by creating UBC Real Estate Corp. to develop market housing.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2004, Strangway was the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Canada Foundation for Innovation, an independent corporation created by the Government of Canada to fund research infrastructure. This autonomous, Ottawa-based organization was founded in 1997 to fund and revitalize national research infrastructure programs that would enable Canadian Universities, Colleges and Research Hospitals to carry out across-the-board scientific and technological projects of benefit to all Canadians. Of CFI's capital investment budget of $3.65 billion, more than $2.7 billion was invested during Strangway's six-year tenure – effectively stemming the loss of Canadian researchers to other countries. It was during this time that he played a key role in helping the Canadian government to create the Canada Research Chairs.

{"id": "4107188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helga%20Pedersen%20%28Norway%29", "title": "Helga Pedersen (Norway)", "text": "Helga Pedersen (born 13 January 1973) is a Norwegian politician, former Minister, and member of the Storting, who served as the deputy leader for the Labour Party from 2007 to 2015. A native of Sør-Varanger, she served between 2003 and 2005 as the County Mayor of the northernmost Finnmark county. From 2005 to 2009 she served as Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs, becoming the youngest member of the Labour-led Red-Green Coalition headed by Jens Stoltenberg.\n\nA teacher by profession, she has spent most her adult life as a career politician. In 2009 she was elected to the Norwegian parliament, the Storting for the first time, and from 2009 until the 2013 parliamentary election she served as the Labour Party's parliamentary leader. Officially registered as a member of the Sámi national minority, Pedersen was Norway's first officially Sámi cabinet minister.\n\nEarly life \nHelga Pedersen was born in the municipality of Sør-Varanger in Finnmark county on 13 January 1973, but was raised in the rural settlement of Vestertana in the nearby Tana municipality. Her father, Terje Pedersen (1941-) was a farmer who had built his own sheep-farm, as well as being a fisherman and a local politician.  Her mother, Hjørdis Langholm (1942-), was originally from Jæren and worked as a registered nurse. She grew up with three siblings in a culturally Sámi household.\n\nEducation \n\nShe attended elementary school as well as lower secondary school at the local settlement school in Vestertana. Later she went to Vadsø Upper Secondary school, during which time she spent a year studying at the Lycée Alain Chartier in Bayeux, France. Upon finishing high school, she enrolled in the University of Bergen graduating in 1996 with a bachelor's degree in Russian studies. After leaving Bergen she enrolled in the University of Tromsø, graduating in 1998 with a degree in History.\n\nEarly career \nPedersen started her professional career in 1992, when she was employed as a teacher's assistant, and later full-time teacher at the rural Boftsa school in Tana. She left the job in 1993. In 1998 she was hired as a construction planning consultant by the Finnmark county administration. This employment lasted until 2000.\n\nPolitical career \nHer political career started early. She became leader of her local Workers' Youth League chapter at age 19 and later served as political adviser within the Labour Party. At age 30 she was elected county mayor for Finnmark.\nFrom April to October 2001, during the first cabinet Stoltenberg, she was appointed political advisor in the Ministry of Industry and Trade. In 2005, during the second cabinet Stoltenberg, she was appointed Minister of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs. Pedersen is the first politician of Sámi descent to have been member of any country's government, and also the first member of any ethnic minority hold a place in the Norwegian government.\n\nOn the local level she was a deputy member of Finnmark county council from 1999 to 2003, and county mayor from 2003 to 2005. In 2007 she was elected as deputy leader of the Labour Party, as the first woman with Sámi background to hold this position.  Following the 2009 election, Pedersen was chosen to be the parliamentary leader for the Labour Party in the Storting. She therefore resigned as fishery minister and left the cabinet. She remained in this capacity until the election defeat in the 2013 parliamentary elections, when former prime minister Jens Stoltenberg returned to the parliament.\n\nPedersen was named as a potential candidate for the Labour leadership, after Jens Stoltenberg announced he was stepping down as leader, in order to become the Secretary General of NATO. At a special Party Congress in March 2014, Pedersen was snubbed for the leadership post in favour of former Minister of Health Jonas Gahr Støre. She was instead re-elected as deputy leader. On 3 September 2014, she announced her intention of stepping down as deputy leader of the Labour Party due to family reasons.\n\nMayor of Tana\nShe became mayor of Tana municipality in 2019. Through 2021 she has been part of the municipality's crisis management team (krisestab) in regard to three different incidents:\nthe covid pandemic, a landslide, and a fraud investigation of a manager [from  middle management] in the county administration.\n\nMere weeks before the 2023 party convention, Pedersen was open to succeeding Kjersti Stenseng as party secretary as part of a greater renewal of the party's leadership. This was despite the fact that Stenseng had previously announced that she would seek re-election. On 30 April, Pedersen announced that she wouldn't stand as a candidate to succeed Stenseng, arguing that she didn't have sufficient support within the party.\n\nPedersen was succeeded by the Centre Party's Jon Erland Balto on 12 October 2023 following the local elections the previous month.\n\nPersonal life \nPedersen is married to Erik Brenli, a journalist originally from Brandbu in Hadeland. They married on 12 July 2008, after having been in a relationship for almost five years. Together they have two daughters, named Anna and Maja and they divide their time between Oslo and their rural estate in Vestertana, Finnmark.\n\nBoth Pedersen and her children are officially listed as members of the Sámi national minority, gaining some privileges in regards to the Sami parliamentary elections, as well as in agriculture. Pedersen speaks fluently the Sámi language, and always dons the traditional Sámi Gákti dress on official celebrations and receptions.\n\nControversies \nIn 2009 media said that Pedersen and her husband illegally had resided in their beach-front home in Tana. The residence was only approved as a part-time vacation retreat, and the couple had not applied for the necessary permits to have it reclassified as an all-year residence.\n\nIn 2014 at a local meeting of Labour party members in Vadsø, she called for members to tar (or smear) () the Conservative-led government; there was criticism, and she apologized for her comments.\n\nReferences \n\n1973 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Sør-Varanger\nGovernment ministers of Norway\nLabour Party (Norway) politicians\nChairmen of County Councils of Norway\nFinnmark politicians\nNorwegian Sámi politicians\nUniversity of Bergen alumni\nUniversity of Tromsø alumni\nNorwegian Sámi people\nMembers of the Storting\nNorwegian Christians\nWomen government ministers of Norway\n21st-century Norwegian politicians\n21st-century Norwegian women politicians\nWomen members of the Storting\nWomen mayors of places in Norway"}

{"id": "4107195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%20Radulov", "title": "Alexander Radulov", "text": "Alexander Valerievich Radulov (; born 5 July 1986) is a Russian professional ice hockey player for Ak Bars Kazan of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He had previously had two separate stints with the Nashville Predators, the NHL team which had drafted him, from 2006 to 2008 and again in 2012, as well one season with the Montreal Canadiens, five seasons with the Dallas Stars between 2016 and 2022, and eight seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), split evenly between Salavat Yulaev Ufa and CSKA Moscow from 2008 to 2016.\n\nRadulov is a two-time World Champion (2008 and 2009) with Russia; a 2011 Gagarin Cup champion with Salavat Yulaev Ufa; and a 2006 Memorial Cup champion with the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL)'s Quebec Remparts. He won the Golden Stick Award (KHL MVP) on four occasions. Radulov ranks second in all-time KHL scoring with 427 points, behind Sergei Mozyakin. He is of mixed Russian and Gagauz ethnicity. Alexander is the brother of Igor Radulov.\n\nPlaying career\n\nJunior career\nRadulov began his North American career in 2004–05, selected at the 2004 Canadian Hockey League Import player draft by the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). That year, he finished third in scoring for his team, with 75 points in 65 games, behind Josh Hennessy and Karl Gagné.\n\nThe following year, Radulov became one of the most exciting and dominant players to play in the QMJHL. In the first half of the season, he and rookie Angelo Esposito formed one of the most explosive duos in the league. He became equally renowned for skating in front of the opposing team's bench and twirling his stick around and banging the handle on the ice, as if to put a sword into a sheath, after scoring a goal, something that angered opposing players but captivated and inspired his head coach, Patrick Roy.\n\nOn 28 October 2005, Radulov set a new franchise record with six goals against the Drummondville Voltigeurs. He added an assist in the eventual 11–3 win. That night, Radulov tied the Remparts team's record with Eric Chouinard for most points in a single game, with seven. Later, on 19 March 2006, in a game against the 2005 Memorial Cup second-place finishing Rimouski Océanic, for whom his teammates Cédrick Desjardins and Michal Sersen played for in 2004–05, Radulov wrote history in the Québec Colisée by scoring an unprecedented 7 goals and 4 assists for 11 points, breaking both records for most goals and points in a single game for the Remparts, in a lopsided 16–3 victory.\n\nRadulov owns the Remparts record for the most consecutive point streak games with 50, passing the 28-game mark established by Eric Chouinard in the 1999–2000 season. Radulov is ranked second all-time with that sequence in the QMJHL, only behind Mario Lemieux, with 62.\n\nRadulov finished as the scoring leader for the QMJHL and the CHL in 2005–06 with 152 points (61 goals and 91 assists). He currently owns the record for the most points in a single season for the Remparts, surpassing the mark of 120 set by Simon Gagné in 1998–99. Radulov also owns the record for the most goals and assists in a season as a Rempart. He passed the mark of 57 goals set by Eric Chouinard and the mark of 75 assists set by Wes Scanzano, both in 1999–2000. He also tied with Pavel Rosa for the most points by a QMJHL European player in a single season. His 61 goals were second-highest in the QMJHL for the 2005–06 season; Maxime Boisclair of the Chicoutimi Saguenéens was first, with 70.\n\nIn the 2006 QMJHL playoffs, Radulov scored 55 points (21 goals and 34 assists) and was ranked again as the scoring leader. He registered at least a point in each game. Radulov finished only two points shy of the playoff points record set by Simon Gamache in 2000–01. In the Remparts' semi-final series against the Acadie-Bathurst Titan, he had 19 points in the seven-game series alone. He lost the MVP award, however, to victorious Moncton Wildcats forward Mārtiņš Karsums.\n\nAll team records set by Radulov are for the new edition of the Remparts, which began in the 1997–98 season.\n\nRadulov delivered an incredible performance in the Remparts' 2006 Memorial Cup championship game victory over the Moncton Wildcats. In the 6–2 win, he netted two goals and assisted on three more, totaling five points, one point away from tying the all-time record in a Memorial Cup final. He registered nine points (five goals and four assists) in four games and won the Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy as the tournament MVP.\n\nOn 28 November 2007, the Remparts retired Radulov's number 22 jersey.\n\nNashville Predators\nDuring Radulov's 2005–06 season in the QMJHL, he signed a three-year, entry-level professional contract with the Nashville Predators on 9 January 2006. He would begin his professional career as a member of the Predators' minor league affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League (AHL), the following season. He was selected Player of the Week on 16 October 2006, posting two goals and four assists in only two games.\n\nOn 21 October 2006, Radulov made his NHL debut with the Predators against the Vancouver Canucks, logging seven minutes and one minor penalty. He scored his first career NHL goal on his first career shot against the San Jose Sharks on 26 October. Following another reassignment to Milwaukee, Radulov remained on the Nashville roster for the rest of the 2006–07 season after he was recalled on 21 November 2006.\n\nIn Game 2 of the first round of the 2007 Stanley Cup playoffs, Radulov was suspended for one game for his hit on San Jose forward Steve Bernier. Bernier was sent into the boards head first and lay motionless on the ice for three minutes, before being helped off by teammates Joe Thornton and Marcel Goc. Bernier, however, did not suffer any serious injury.\n\nSalavat Yulaev Ufa\n\nTransfer dispute\nOn 11 July 2008, it was announced that although Radulov was still under contract with the Nashville Predators for one more season, he had signed a three-year contract with Salavat Yulaev Ufa of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), which would be extended to four years. Radulov had previously notified the Predators organization of his desire to play in Russia, stating that he was being offered better conditions.\n\nImmediately after the announcement, the Predators, NHL and the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) all released statements emphasizing that Radulov's contract obligated him to play for the Predators through the 2008–09 season and that signing with a team in Russia was a direct violation of an agreement made the previous day between the NHL and all international hockey leagues to respect players' existing contracts. After the IIHF ordered that Ufa void Radulov's contract, Ilya Kochevrin, vice-president of the KHL, argued that Radulov was signed on 5 July, before the agreement was made on 10 July. While the contract remained disputed, the IIHF suspended Radulov from international play on 18 July as investigations continued, although the suspension was soon lifted.\n\nNashville management gave Radulov until 1 September to confirm his intention to remain with the team. They suspended him on 2 September without pay for the 2008–09 season.\n\nTwo Continental Cups\nIn his first year, the 2008–09 season with Salavat Yulaev Ufa, a 22-year-old Radulov would finish third on the team with 48 points in 52 games. The team would win the Continental Cup as regular season champions. In the playoffs, they would bow out in the first round, with Radulov earning two assists in four games.\n\nIn his second year, the 2009–10 season, Radulov would lead his team with 63 points in 54 games. The team would win a second straight Continental Cup, but in the playoffs, they would lose in the Eastern Conference Final to eventual champions Ak Bars Kazan in six games. Radulov led the team with 19 points in 16 games.\n\nRadulov won his first Golden Stick Award as KHL regular season MVP, and made the season All-Star team. His 63 points placed him fourth in the league, three points away from league leader Sergei Mozyakin, who had played two more games. Radulov's plus-minus rating of +44 was second best in the league, behind teammate Patrick Thoresen's +45. Radulov finished the season tied second in assists (39) and tied for ninth in goals (24).\n\nGagarin Cup champion\nIn his third year, the 2010–11 season, Radulov would lead his team and all of the KHL with 80 points in 54 games. Salavat Yulaev Ufa would finish second in the league, with division rival Avangard Omsk winning the Continental Cup. In the playoffs, the pairing of Radulov and Thoresen would lead the team to a Gagarin Cup, with each of them scoring 18 points apiece over 21 games; each scored 3 goals and added 15 assists.\n\nRadulov won his second Golden Stick Award as KHL regular season MVP and made the All-Star team again. His record-setting 80 points were 14 more than linemate Thoresen's 66 points and 19 more than Roman Červenka's 61 points for Avangard Omsk. Radulov finished the season first in assists, tied for 15th in goals, and tied for first in plus-minus rating (+27).\n\nFinal year\nAt the conclusion of the previous championship winning season, the contract of head coach Vyacheslav Bykov was expiring. At the time, Bykov also served as the head coach of the Russian national team, having held the post for the previous five years. Unfortunately, a poor showing for Russia at the 2011 IIHF World Championship, where the team finished without a medal for the first time under his tenure, prompted Salavat not to renew his contract with the club.\n\nAs a result, a number of important players left the club in the off season—Patrick Thoresen, Kirill Koltsov and Dmitri Kalinin all signed with mega club SKA Saint Petersburg. This led to the rehiring of head coach Sergei Mikhalev, who had coached the team in the 2008–09 season to a Continental Cup, with a record of 43–8–0–5. However, he was unable to replicate past results and was fired as head coach after 21 games, posting a result of 9–8–0–4.\n\nThis led to a third coach within the calendar year being named to the post: Vener Safin. As the team was struggling, more players were traded away, including Robert Nilsson and Jakub Klepiš, among others. The team would round out the season with a record of 21–10–0–2 and ultimately finish eighth in the league. In the playoffs, they would lose to Ak Bars Kazan in the first round, in six games.\n\nIn his final year, the 2011–12 season, Radulov would once again lead his team and all of the KHL, with 63 points in 50 games despite an overturned roster. In the playoffs, he would add six assists in six games. At season's end, Radulov won his third Golden Stick Award as KHL regular season MVP and made the All-Star team for the third time. He finished the season first in assists and tied for second in goals.\n\nReturn to Nashville\nFollowing the end of Salavat Yulaev Ufa's 2011–12 season, on 12 March 2012, it was reported that paperwork was being finalized for Radulov to return to Nashville for the balance of the regular season and for the 2012 playoffs. Five days later, Radulov's agent Yuri Nikolaev confirmed Radulov was indeed returning to the NHL for Nashville's 22 March 2012, game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The day before his return, Radulov was presented his jersey at a press conference, where the Predators announced they had lifted his suspension from the team, finalizing his return. In his return to Nashville, Radulov scored the Predators' only goal in a 5–1 loss to the Penguins. He concluded the 2011–12 regular season with seven points (three goals and four assists) in nine games.\n\nOn 1 May 2012, Radulov and Predators teammate Andrei Kostitsyn were spotted at a Scottsdale, Arizona, bar at 5:00 AM the night before Game 2 of their second round playoff series against the Phoenix Coyotes, thus breaking team curfew. Both were subsequently suspended by Predators management for Game 3. Predators general manager David Poile said of the incident, \"What they did was unacceptable and the coaches and myself had to come to the plate and do the right thing for the team. It happened. It's really unfortunate. It's selfish behaviour and we'll just have to leave it at that.\"\n\nOn 6 June 2012, the Predators announced that they would not be extending Radulov's contract, thus making him an unrestricted free agent.\n\nCSKA Moscow\n\nOn 2 July 2012, Radulov signed a four-year contract with CSKA Moscow of the KHL worth an average annual value of $9.2 million. He would lead the KHL in points or finish runner up, in three of the four seasons of his contract: 2012–13 (second), 2014–15 (first) and 2015–16 (second).\n\nThe 2013–14 season would be filled with injuries, and Radulov would miss multiple stretches of games. He would go on to appear in only 34 games, while still putting up 34 points. He would also miss the playoffs, during which CSKA was eliminated in the first round.\n\nIn his third year, 2014–15, Radulov led his team to a Continental Cup. In the playoffs, CSKA reached the Conference Final of the Gagarin Cup, losing in Game 7 to the eventual champions SKA Saint Petersburg.\n\nIn his fourth and final season, 2015–16, Radulov led CSKA to a second-straight Continental Cup. In the playoffs, they once again met SKA Saint Petersburg in the Conference Final, eliminating them in four-straight games. However, CSKA would then fall short of their ultimate goal and lose Game 7 of the Gagarin Cup Final to champions Metallurg Magnitogorsk.\n\nMontreal Canadiens\nOn 1 July 2016, Radulov returned to the NHL as a free agent, signing a one-year, $5.75 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens. Radulov assumed a scoring role on the top line of the Canadiens and went on to score 18 goals and 36 assists for 54 points in 76 games played.\n\nDallas Stars\nOn July 3, 2017, having been unable to agree to another contract with the Canadiens, Radulov signed with the Dallas Stars to a five-year, $31.25 million contract. With the Stars, Radulov reached the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals losing to the Tampa Bay Lightning (2–4). However, the following seasons were plagued with an injury and a decrease of his point production, posting only 22 points in 71 games in the last year of his contract.\n\nAk Bars Kazan\nOn May 31, 2022, his agent announced his return to KHL, signing a two-year contract with Ak Bars Kazan. It was later announced officially by Ak Bars on 14 July 2022.\n\nInternational play\n\nRadulov has played for Russia since the junior youth level, earning silver medals in the 2005 and 2006 World Junior Championships. He made his full senior men's debut in the 2007 World Championships, claiming a bronze medal before capturing two golds at the 2008 and 2009 World Championships.\n\nAt the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Radulov led Russia in goals (three) and points (six) in five games, though the team lost in the quarter-finals to Finland, ultimately finishing in fifth place.\n\nPersonal life\nIn May 2015, Radulov married rhythmic gymnast Darya Dmitriyeva. Their first child was born in November 2015. The pair divorced on June 7, 2017.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\nInternational\n\nAwards and achievements\n\nKHL\nTrophies\n Gagarin Cup champion: 2011\n Continental Cup winner: 2009, 2010, 2015, 2016\n Golden Stick Award: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015\n\nAHL\nPlayer of the week\n Week 2: 10 October 2006 to 15 October 2006\n\nCHL\nPlayer of the week\n Week 1: 1 November 2005\n Week 21: 21 March 2006\n\nTrophies\n Memorial Cup: 2006\n Stafford Smythe Memorial Trophy: 2006\n CHL Top Scorer Award: 2006\n CHL Player of the Year: 2006\n\nQMJHL\n\nPlayer of the week\n Week 6: 24 to 30 October 2005\n Week 18: 23 to 29 January 2006\n Week 23: 27 February to 5 March 2006\n Week 25: 14 to 19 March 2006\n\nPlayer of the month\n February 2006\n March 2006\n\nTrophies\n Jean Béliveau Trophy: 2006\n Telus Trophy: 2006\n Michel Brière Memorial Trophy: 2006\n QMJHL First All-Star Team: 2006\n Coupe Postes Canada for QMJHL: 2006\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \nRussianProspects.com Alexander Radulov Profile\n\n1986 births\nLiving people\nAk Bars Kazan players\nDallas Stars players\nHC CSKA Moscow players\nHC Dynamo Moscow players\nIce hockey players at the 2010 Winter Olympics\nIce hockey players at the 2014 Winter Olympics\nMilwaukee Admirals players\nMontreal Canadiens players\nNashville Predators draft picks\nNashville Predators players\nNational Hockey League first-round draft picks\nOlympic ice hockey players for Russia\nQuebec Remparts players\nRussian expatriate ice hockey people\nRussian ice hockey right wingers\nSalavat Yulaev Ufa players\nSportspeople from Nizhny Tagil"}

One of its first male choirs was formed in the Red Cow Hotel in the summer of 1883 and developed into a National Eisteddfod winner, culminating in a royal command performance for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in 1895. The choir would later disband after the South Wales Valleys suffered during the massive economic downturn of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom and two World Wars.\n \nThe present Treorchy Male Choir was reformed on October 16, 1946, under the baton of John Haydn Davies, who led the choir for 20 years. They reached musical distinction in the national Eisteddfod by gaining a record eight national wins, making a total of twenty-two first prizes out of twenty seven entries.\n\nThe Treorchy Male Choir is a registered charity. It has launched its own Junior Musician of the Year competition for children in the Rhondda area.\n\nRecordings\nTreorchy was to become the first male choir to venture into the field of popular music and subsequently the choir has made more than fifty commercial recordings. Their popular music production include an album of music by Freddie Mercury and Queen and two recordings of music by Bob Marley, but they have also recorded more classical works and became the first British choir to perform Sibelius’ Kullervo Symphony in Finnish.\n\nCollaborations\n\nThe choir has performed together with various celebrities, in concerts, on recordings, and on television. Their collaborations include performances with Tom Jones, Ella Fitzgerald, Julie Andrews, Harry Secombe, Burt Bacharach, Shirley Bassey, Gwyneth Jones, Michael Ball, Katherine Jenkins, Iris Williams, Max Boyce, Bryn Terfel, Aled Jones, Charlotte Church, Ozzy Osbourne, Jon Bon Jovi, Cliff Richard, Andrea Bocelli, McFly, Russell Watson and Il Divo.\n\nTours\nSince the early 1980s the choir has undertaken a number of overseas tours beginning with two visits to Canada and a performance in Strasbourg Cathedral for its congregation of almost 6,000 people. A series of four tours of the USA followed, with visits to the White House and performances in San Francisco, Denver, Seattle and the Mid West. Treorchy has also enjoyed a close connection with Australia, becoming the first Welsh choir to appear at the Sydney Opera House in 1986. The choir has made two further visits to Australia appearing in Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne and also making a return to the Opera House in Sydney. In Britain, the choir has appeared on the Royal Variety Performance and has become a regular entertainer on the turf of the Millennium Stadium for various rugby union international games.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Treorchy Male Choir website\n BBC Wales profile\n \n \n\nWelsh choirs\nMusical groups established in 1883\nTreorchy\n1883 establishments in Wales"}

He wrote in the French and Monégasque languages.\n\nPrincipal writings\n\nHe wrote in 1931 the final version of the text of the Monaco national anthem and he is considered as the first writer in Monégasque; before him, there was just oral literature. He wrote three books: \n\nA legenda de Santa Devota/Santa Devota (1927) -about the legend of Saint Devota.\nBülüghe munegasche (1941).\nU Campanin de San Niculau\nQuelques notes sur les traditions de Monaco (1960).\n\nNotari's writing in Monégasque has led to a veritable flowering of literature published in the language. A grammar and a dictionary by Louis Frolla and numerous other works, including by Georges Franzi, Louis Barral and Suzanne Simone (dictionary) Louis Canis, Jules Soccal, Lazare Sauvaigo and Robert Buisson, combine to allow this small country's own language to take its visible and permanent place among the other Romance languages.\n\nHowever, while a substantial proportion of Notari's work was religious in inspiration, Monégasque is probably unique among the Romance languages in that it possesses, as yet, no Bible translation.\n\nFormer fascist sympathies\n\nIn his researches in Monégasque identity, Notari got in touch in the 1930s with Italian academics sustaining regional languages for a Latin federation pledged to the fascist Italian government. In this way, he wrote a few poems celebrating Benito Mussolini.\n\nIn the post-War era, however, any fascist sympathies which Notari may once have held were not stressed.\n\nPersonal legacy\nThe decision by the late Prince Rainier III to sponsor Monégasque teachers in local schools owed much to the groundwork in promoting Monégasque which writers such as Notari and others laid. Louis Notari was also prominent in civil engineering in the Principality, and was noted for his work on Monaco's renowned exotic garden, which annually hosts large numbers of visitors from many countries.\n\nHis daughter Roxane became the first woman elected to the National Council in 1963.\n\nA street in the suburb of La Condamine, Monaco, is named after Louis Notari.

{"id": "4107227", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamnalal%20Bajaj", "title": "Jamnalal Bajaj", "text": "Jamnalal Kaniram Bajaj (4 November 1889 – 11 February 1942) was an Indian industrialist. He founded the Bajaj Group of companies in the 1920s, and the group now has 24 companies, including six that are listed on the bourses. He was also a close and beloved associate of Mahatma Gandhi, who is known to have often declared that Jamnalal was his fifth son.\n\nBackground and early life\nJamnalal Bajaj was born in 1889 into a poor family of Kaniram and Birdibai in a village named Kashi Ka Bas in Jaipur state. In 1894, Seth Bachharaj Bajaj, a rich Wardha businessman, and his family were going to Kashi Ka Bas village temple. They spotted young Jamnalal playing outside his home and were drawn to him. After much persuasion, Jamnalal was adopted as Seth Bajaj's grandson. In return, Bajaj installed a well in order to help the village.  \n\nSeth Bachhraj(bajaj) was a distant relative on his father's side, and was a well-known and respected trader in the British Raj.\n\nJamnalal was married at age twelve to JankiDevi, who was around nine years old. \n\nUpon coming of age, under the tutelage of Seth Bachhraj, Jamnalal got involved in the family business of his adoptive family. During this period, he acquired the skills of being a tradesman, rigorous book keeping and buying and selling commodities. He excelled in his work by the time Seth Bachhraj died. In 1926, Jamnalal founded what would become the Bajaj group of industries.\n\nHonorary Magistrate\nDuring the First World War, the British government appeased and honoured native tradesmen, soliciting funds. They appointed Jamnalal an honorary magistrate. When he provided money for the war fund, they conferred on him the title of Rai Bahadur, a title he later surrendered during the non-co-operation movement of 1921.\n\nFollower of Gandhi\nUpon Mahatma Gandhi's return from South Africa, Jamnalal took in interest in Gandhi's way of life, his principles, such as Ahimsa (non-violence), and his dedication to the poor. He could understand Gandhi's vision that home-made goods were the answer to India's poverty. He considered that some British companies were importing cheap, raw cotton from India and sending back finished cloth. He was humbled by the simple life that Gandhi was leading at the Sabarmati Ashram. He was impressed by the Ashram's routine of prayer and physical work.   He brought his wife Jankidevi and his children to live in the Ashram. However, this close relationship and his deep involvement in the independence movement did not leave Jamnalal Bajaj with much time to spend on his newly launched business venture.\n\nFreedom struggle\nIn 1920, Jamanalal was elected chairman of the reception committee for the Nagpur session of the Indian National Congress. He gave up the title of Rai Bahadur conferred on him by the British government and joined the non-co-operation movement in 1921. Later, in 1923, he participated in the flag satyagraha, defying a ban on flying the national flag in Nagpur, and was detained by British forces. This earned him national admiration.\n\nHe wanted Gandhi to move to Wardha and make it the center of his activities. After the Dandi March in April 1930, Gandhi moved to Sevagram, a small village near Wardha, since he wanted to live close to the rural populace. Gandhi vowed not to return to Sabarmati Ashram until freedom was achieved.\n\nJamanalal was named the president of Gandhi Seva Sangha, a group of workers who dedicated their time to constructive work. He was later elected a member of the Congress Working Committee and as the treasurer of Congress in 1933.\n\nSocial initiatives\nJamanalal Bajaj was interested in initiatives such as the removal of untouchability, promotion of Hindi, and Khadi and village Industries. He had toured across the country promoting Khadi. In 1925, he was chosen as the treasurer of the All India Spinners Association. He was also the president of the All India Hindi Sahitya Sammelan (literary convention) that promoted Hindi as the single language to unite all Indians. He was instrumental in publishing Hindi magazines and books. He initiated the Gandhi Hindi Pustak Bhandar (bookshop) in Bombay and started the Sasta Sahitya Mandal (publishing house).\n\nHe founded the Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha along with C. Rajagopalachari in hopes of spreading the learning of Hindi across the country.\n\nFrom 1927, he served as the first Treasurer of the Managing Committee of Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi. Later in 1928, he became a life member of the university, while still serving as the treasurer.\n\nWith the intent of eradicating untouchability, he fought the non-admission of Harijans into Hindu temples in his home town of Wardha. As orthodox Hindu priests and Brahmins objected, he opened his own family temple, the Laxmi Narayan Mandir, in Wardha, for the Harijans in 1928.  He began a campaign by eating a meal with Harijans and opening public wells to them. He opened several wells in his fields and gardens.\n\nDue to his devotion, he was elected the chief of the Jaipur Rajya Praja Mandal in 1938. While chief, he negotiated a truce between the Maharajas of Sikar and Jaipur.\n\nIn honour of his social initiatives  the Jamnalal Bajaj Award has been instituted by the Bajaj Foundation. Past awardees include Nelson Mandela and Desmund Tutu.\n\nBusiness interests\nBesides Bajaj Auto Ltd, the other major companies in the group include Mukand Ltd, Bajaj Electricals Ltd and Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd. One of his grandsons, Rahul Bajaj, ran the family flagship company, Bajaj Auto.\n\nLegacy and memorials\nSeveral institutions in India bear his name, including the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies. A locality, JB Nagar, in the sub-urban Andheri in Mumbai has been named after him. Jamnalal Bajaj Award was established in 1978 by the Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation and are given away each year on his birth anniversary.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n In Gandhi's Footsteps : The Life and Times of Jamnalal Bajaj by B.

{"id": "4107229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Strand%20Station", "title": "The Strand Station", "text": "The Strand Station, also referred to as Auckland Strand Station, is a railway station located on the eastern edge of the Auckland CBD. It serves as the long-distance railway station for Auckland. It is the northern terminus of the Northern Explorer service between Auckland and Wellington, and the northern terminus for the Te Huia service. Suburban services are not scheduled to pass through the station, however, it serves as a backup for Britomart Transport Centre during times of disruption.\n\nThe platforms were formerly part of the Auckland Railway Station complex which was opened in 1930 on Beach Road, replacing the previous railway terminus which was on the Queen Street site where Britomart now stands. The 1930 station was the third to serve as the rail terminus for Auckland, and remained the sole station serving the CBD until its closure in July 2003, when Britomart became the new terminus. The original Platform 7 (now referred to as Platform 1) was retained for limited use as 'The Strand Station', named after the adjacent street. It continued to be used by a limited number of peak-hour suburban trains for a few months following the opening of Britomart. After this, the sole used platform served as a limited-use station for excursions and charters, though it and the other abandoned platforms fell into a state of disrepair. In August 2011, the original Platform 7 and Platform 6 (now referred to as Platform 2) were redeveloped and officially reopened for potential use during Rugby World Cup 2011, although they were never used for that purpose. These platforms were used for Northern Explorer services from December 2015 until December 2021.\n\nHistory\n\nAuckland Railway Station\n\nRefurbishment\n\nBetween 2003 and 2011, the platforms had deteriorated into a decrepit state. All of the platforms had been shortened for the Britomart Curve, sections of removed track were stacked up on top of each other adjacent to the platforms, and grass and weeds covered most of the site.\n\nIn 2011, two platforms were upgraded by Auckland Transport to prepare them for use as an alternative to Britomart for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In a $1.7 million project, the canopies were removed from two platforms, with a small section left behind for historic purposes, and the canopies on the other platforms were also left standing due to their heritage value. The platforms were resurfaced, and amenities such as lighting and a public address system were installed.\nThe platforms did not end up being used during the 2011 Rugby World Cup, but they continued to serve as a potential backup station for Britomart during disruptions.\n\nDuring 2013, stabling facilities were constructed in the disused part of the station, to the north of the refurbished platforms. The stabling yard, officially called the Strand Distributed Stabling Facility, is designed to hold trains when they are not in service. In 2014, the station was fully electrified as part of Auckland's railway electrification project. In December 2015, the station became the terminus of Auckland's sole long-distance passenger train service, the Northern Explorer which ran between Auckland and Wellington, following the shift of its Auckland terminus from Britomart. As the Northern Explorer had become the only diesel service still using Britomart, its operator KiwiRail was requested by Auckland Transport to fund an upgrade to the diesel extraction fans at the underground station, but KiwiRail decided it would be more cost-efficient to cease serving Britomart and move the Northern Explorer terminus to The Strand instead.\n\nCurrent use\nThe Strand is occasionally used for excursion trains and is also available as a backup station for Britomart in case of disruptions. Since electrification, part of the station has been used as a stabling facility. Platform 8 restaurant occupies the foyer of the 1930 station.\n\nTe Huia extends to The Strand on Saturdays from 24 July 2021. It was extended to The Strand on weekdays from 24 January 2022, much earlier than an earlier 2024 proposal, contingent on the Third Main Line project being sufficiently advanced. It may also run on Sundays and public holidays after year 4 or 5; once track access in the Auckland area is not required on Sundays for key rail projects.\n\nFuture\n\nNgāti Whātua Ōrākei, the local iwi who owns much of the land in the area of the station, states on their masterplan for the area the wish for the station to be renamed Te Tōangaroa, the traditional name of Mechanics Bay, the reclaimed bay in which the station is located.\n\nProposals have also involved or inferred the return of suburban trains to The Strand, though this would entail moving the station further east or building new platforms on the tracks between Quay Park Junction and Britomart. In this case Eastern Line trains would call at The Strand/Te Tōangaroa station.\n\nSee also\n List of Auckland railway stations\nBritomart Transport Centre\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Auckland's new Railway Station (1927 article in NZR magazine)\n\nPhotographs of Auckland Railway Station held in Auckland Libraries' heritage collections.\n1928 photo of Breakwater Rd goods shed about to open.\n\nRail transport in Auckland\nBuildings and structures in Auckland\nRailway stations in New Zealand\nHeritage New Zealand Category 1 historic places in the Auckland Region\nRailway stations opened in 1930\nRailway stations closed in 2003\nGummer and Ford buildings and structures\n1930s architecture in New Zealand\nAuckland CBD\nParnell, New Zealand\nRailway stations in New Zealand opened in the 1930s"}

{"id": "4107235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga%20Times%20Free%20Press", "title": "Chattanooga Times Free Press", "text": "The Chattanooga Times Free Press is a daily broadsheet newspaper published in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and is distributed in the metropolitan Chattanooga region of southeastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia. It is one of Tennessee's major newspapers and is owned by WEHCO Media, Inc., a diversified communications company with ownership in 14 daily newspapers, 11 weekly newspapers and 13 cable television companies in six states.\n\nHistory\n\nChattanooga Times\nThe Chattanooga Times was first published on December 15, 1869, by the firm Kirby & Gamble. In 1878, 20-year-old Adolph Ochs borrowed money and bought half interest in the struggling morning paper. Two years later when he assumed full ownership, it cost him $5,500. In 1892, the paper's staff moved to the Ochs Building on Georgia Avenue at East Eighth Street, which is now the Dome Building. In 1896, Ochs entrusted the management of the paper to his brother-in-law Harry C. Adler when he purchased The New York Times (circulation 20,000). Ochs remained publisher of the Chattanooga Times. Ochs' slogan, \"To give the news impartially, without fear or favor\" remains affixed atop the paper's mast today. The Times was controlled by the Ochs-Sulzberger family until 1999.\n\nChattanooga Free Press\nIn 1933, Roy Ketner McDonald launched a free Thursday tabloid, delivered door to door, featuring stories, comics, and advertisements for his stores. Three years later, circulation had hit 65,000 per week, making some ad revenue. On August 31, the paper began publishing as an evening daily with paid subscriptions. One year later, the Free Press circulation reached 33,000, within reach of another p.m. competitor, The Chattanooga News (circulation 35,000). McDonald acquired The Chattanooga News from George Fort Milton Jr. in December 1939, when the majority bondholders of the News, specifically Milton's step-mother Abby Crawford Milton, and her three children, acted on a technical missed payment deadline of bond payment obligations—allowing them to foreclose on the paper. Despite heroic sacrifice and fundraising by George Fort Milton and his employees, payments to the creditors were rejected as they had already agreed to sell the paper to Roy McDonald, publisher of the rival Free Press, for $150,000. McDonald then appropriated the News name to prevent Milton from using it, and the Free Press became the News-Free Press. In their guide to writing, The Elements of Style, William Strunk and E. B. White used the paper as an illustration of comically misleading punctuation, noting that the hyphen made it sound \"as though the paper were news-free, or devoid of news.\"\n\nCompetition and agreement\n\nBy 1941, News-Free Press daily circulation reached 51,600, surpassing the Times, with 50,078. In competition, the Times began an evening newspaper competitor, the Chattanooga Evening Times. One year later, however, the competing newspapers joined business and production operations, while maintaining separate news and editorial departments. The Times ceased publishing in the evening and the News-Free Press dropped its Sunday edition. The two shared offices at 117 E. 10th St.\n\nTwenty-four years later, McDonald withdrew from the agreement. He bought the Davenport Hosiery Mills building at 400 E. 11th St. in 1966, and competition resumed between the two papers. The News-Free Press was the first paper in the nation to dissolve a joint operating agreement. That August, the day after the News-Free Press resumed Sunday publication, the Times responded with an evening newspaper: the Chattanooga Post. On Feb. 25, 1970, the Post ceased publication after the U.S. filed an anti-trust suit against the paper. The News-Free Press gave Chattanooga its first full-color newspaper photos.\n\nEach newspaper won a single Pulitzer Prize. In 1956, Charles L. Bartlett of the Washington Bureau of The Chattanooga Times won the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, for articles leading to the resignation of the secretary of the Air Force, Harold E. Talbott. In 1977, staff photographer Robin Hood of the Chattanooga News-Free Press received the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography. The photo was of legless Vietnam veteran Eddie Robinson in his wheelchair watching a rained-out parade in Chattanooga with his tiny son on his lap.\n\nWhen business declined for the News-Free Press, 14 employees mortgaged their homes to help keep the newspaper afloat. In the late 1970s, Walter E. Hussman Jr., the 31-year-old publisher of the Arkansas Democrat, approached McDonald for counsel regarding a bitter struggle with the Arkansas Gazette. In 1980, the Times and the News-Free Press entered into a new joint operating agreement. In 1990, after leading the paper for 54 years, McDonald died at age 88. Three years later, the paper returned to its original name: the Chattanooga Free Press.\n\nChattanooga Times Free Press\nIn 1998, Hussman bought the Free Press. A year later, he bought the Times as well and merged the two papers. The first edition of the Chattanooga Times Free Press was published on January 5, 1999. The Times Free Press runs two editorial pages: one staunchly liberal, the other staunchly conservative, reflecting the editorial leanings of the Times and Free Press, respectively. The Tennessee Press Association recognized the Times Free Press as the best newspaper in Tennessee in 2002. One year later, Editor and Publisher magazine named the Times Free Press as one of 10 newspapers in the United States \"doing it right\". The newspaper has subscribers in southeastern Tennessee and northern Georgia. On Monday, April 14, 2014, the Chattanooga Times Free Press was named a finalist for the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for \"Speak No Evil.\" In 2017, the newspaper was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for \"The Poverty Puzzle.\"\n\nWebsite\n\nWhen the Chattanooga Times Free Press launched its website in 2004, the site was only accessible to paid subscribers and featured only a handful of section pages and links. Four years later, in early 2008, the redesigned online presence of timesfreepress.com debuted, with an emphasis on breaking news, video and multimedia. The site features all local content in the paper, an online edition of the news product, and classified ads, as well. In late 2010, the newspaper launched \"Right 2 Know\", an online database of police mugshots, salaries of government employees, and a map of shootings in Hamilton County, but in August 2020, the newspaper removed the database, noting that the information published rarely met the newspaper's editorial standard of newsworthiness.\n\nOther publications\nThe Times Free Press is also responsible for several other niche publications:\n Chatter – a monthly magazine launched in 2008 with feature stories from around the area\n \"Get Out\" – a monthly magazine focused on everything outdoor in Chattanooga and the surrounding area\n \"Edge\" – a monthly magazine focused on local business\n Noticias Libres – a free weekly Spanish language paper distributed around the Chattanooga area\n ChattanoogaNow – a weekend publication distributed in every Thursday's Times Free Press that covers music, movies, dining and arts\n \"Dining Out\" – a weekly publication focused on food and restaurants\n\nCurrent and past publishers and contributors\n Jeff Deloach, immediate past president\n Charles L.

{"id": "4107250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morriston%20Orpheus%20Choir", "title": "Morriston Orpheus Choir", "text": "The Morriston Orpheus Choir (), based in Morriston, near Swansea, Wales, is a male voice choir, one of the best-known in the UK.\n\nHistory\nThe Choir was formed on April 23, 1935, by Ivor E. Sims and in its early days concentrated primarily on competitions and local concerts. In 1937, the Choir achieved its first success at the Royal National Eisteddfod in Machynlleth, going on to win at the \"National\" on six further occasions. The choir does not presently sing in competitions, preferring to concentrate on concert performances.\n\nOver the years, successive musical directors have developed and broadened the repertoire. Variety is now the hallmark of the Choir's performances which include arrangements by Alwyn Humphreys M.B.E., musical director from 1979 to January 2005 and now the Choir's Conductor Emeritus. In 2005 the Choir appointed its first female Musical Director Sian Pearce to replace Alwyn Humphreys who had decided to retire after serving the Choir since 1979. Sian left the Choir in 2007 and Joy Amman Davies, who in 2004 had been made a Life Member of the Choir in recognition of her outstanding contribution and commitment as accompanist, was appointed musical director. After over a decade in the role Joy Amman Davies retired in August 2021, and after a competitive interview and selection process was succeeded by Conal Bembridge-Sayers.\n\nThe Choir enjoys an international reputation as a leading exponent of male choral singing. Within the United Kingdom the Choir is in constant demand with around 25 engagements a year, including concerts, TV and after-dinner performances. The Choir regularly undertakes concert tours overseas and in 2004 undertook two tours to Taiwan and to Abu Dhabi and Oman. In April 2007 the Choir returned to the UAE, performing in Dubai en route to a concert tour of Australia and New Zealand. In October 2008 the Choir visited Geneva to perform a charity concert. During their stay they also visited and sang in the control room of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).\n\nHighlights of previous overseas tours have included four appearances at British Military Tattoos and Concerts in the former West Berlin, participating at the International Choral Festivals in Nancy, France, and Toronto in Canada, representing Wales at Expo '92 in Seville, Spain, and becoming in 1996, the first British choir to perform at the International Choral Festival in Bydgoszcz, Poland. The Choir has performed in all the major cities of Australia and New Zealand and received standing ovations at their appearances at the world famous Sydney Opera House. In October 2001, the Independent on Sunday reported that the Choir received \"five standing ovations\" at the Carnegie Hall in New York City. In the Spring of 2018 the Choir conducted a week-long tour of Vienna and Kraków, singing in St Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna among other venues.\n\nIn Wales and the UK the Choir has performed in a variety of venues ranging from chapels and village halls to cathedrals and concert halls. It appears regularly in Swansea at the famous Brangwyn Hall in the city centre, as well as the newer Great Hall, at Swansea University's Bay Campus.\n\nThe Choir features regularly on TV. It has produced over 50 recordings and feature in more than 100 compilation albums. Successful ventures into the \"pop\" world have included recordings with T'Pau, the Welsh group The Alarm, and most recently Howard Jones.\n\nWith 2020 marking the Choir's 85th year, a busy schedule of events had been planned, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the choir ceased performances and rehearsals for the first time in its history. With assistance from Swansea University however the choir has been able to restart rehearsals online, which has been the subject of features on BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Cymru, and BBC Wales Today.\n\nMOCSA\n\nThe Choir has a long-standing policy of encouraging young Welsh singers through an annual competition organised by the Morriston Orpheus Choir Supporters' Association (MOCSA). The Young Welsh Singer of the Year Competition has been running for over 40 years, and previous winners include Rebecca Evans and Sir Bryn Terfel\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nMorriston Orpheus website\nBBC Wales feature on the Morriston Orpheus Choir\n\nMusical groups established in 1935\nMusic in Swansea\nWelsh choirs"}

In modern-day Turkey the site is encompassed in the village of Güneyköy, District of Gazipaşa, Antalya Province.\n\nThe city was founded by Antiochus IV Epiphanes around 170 BC. It minted coins from the mid-first  to the mid-third centuries, the last known of which were issued under Roman Emperor Valerian.  The city became part of the kingdom of Lesser Armenia in the 12th century.  In 1332, the Knights Hospitallers took the city, after which it was known variously as Antiochetta, Antiocheta, Antiocheta in Rufine (Papal bull of Pope John XXII), and Antiochia Parva.\n\nSome scholars claim an identity of Antiochia ad Cragum with the city Cragus (Kragos), or although it lies more than 100 km away, with Sidyma, which some scholars assert was the Lycian Cragus (Kragos).\n\nRuins of the city remain, and include fortifications, baths, chapels, the Roman necropolis, a wine press, and the largest Roman mosaic found in Turkey.\n\nIn 2018, latrine mosaics with dirty jokes about Narcissus and Ganymede were discovered in Antiochia ad Cragum, and in 2019, a large pool mosaic was discovered near the city.\n\nBishopric\n\nIn Byzantine times, Antiochia Parva was the seat of an episcopal see of the Roman province of Isauria in the Diocese of the East. It was part of the Patriarchate of Antioch and was suffragan of the Archbishopric of Seleucia.\n\nThe five known ancient bishops of this diocese were: \nAntonius took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325.\nTheodosius in the First Council of Constantinople in 381. \nAcacius was among the fathers of the Council of Chalcedon in 451. \nZacharias took part in the Trullan Council of 692 \nTheophanes finally witnessed the council held in Constantinople in 879–880 that rehabilitated the patriarch Photius of Constantinople.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Antiochia Parva is no longer a residential bishopric. It is today listed as a suppressed and titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. The seat is vacant since April 11, 1964. It was held previously by:\nJacques-Eugène Louis Ménager  (June 23, 1955 – December 7, 1961)\nAndré-Jean-Marie Charles de la Brousse  (January 26, 1962 – April 11, 1964)\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nPopulated places established in the 2nd century BC\nArchaeological sites in Antalya Province\nAncient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey\nSeleucid colonies in Anatolia\nRoman towns and cities in Turkey\nRuins in Turkey\nAntiochia Parva\nFormer populated places in Cilicia\nPopulated places in ancient Cilicia\nGazipaşa District\nAntiochus IV Epiphanes"}

He was a maternal grandson of Nicolai Lumholtz and brother of Carl Nicolai Stoud Platou, and through the latter an uncle of Valborg Platou and Lars Hannibal Sommerfeldt Stoud Platou. He was a granduncle of Carl Platou.\n\nIn July 1844 in Kråkstad he married the vicar's daughter, Constance Henriette Reiersen (1820–1893). They had a son, Oscar Ludvig Stoud Platou, and their daughter Mimi married Lars Hannibal Sommerfeldt Stoud Platou.\n\nCareer\nHe graduated from the university with the cand.jur. degree in 1839. In 1842 he started holding lectures at the university, and in the same year, when Ulrik Anton Motzfeldt became a Supreme Court Assessor, Platou was hired as a lecturer of jurisprudence from June 1843. In 1849 he was promoted to professor, although there was a vote of dissent in the government—some wanted Frans Christian Faye to advance from lecturer to professor of medicine instead. The dissent went to the Parliament of Norway in 1851, but no change was made. He published little; only one noteworthy book, Om Besiddelse efter norsk Ret (\"On Possession after Norwegian Law\") in 1863. He also participated in ad hoc law commissions. In 1877 he received an honorary degree at Uppsala University.\n\nFrom 1862 to 1864 he was a Supreme Court Assessor, but after 1864 he was only extraordinary Assessor in some cases at the same time as being district stipendiary magistrate in Nes District Court. His son Oscar was deputy judge here from 1870 to 1871. Platou was acting Auditor General of Norway from 1873 to 1874, and participated as Minister of Auditing in three interim governments: first \nduring King Oscar II's travel in Germany from May to June 1875; then during King Oscar II's travel in Russia in July 1875; then during the King's and the Crown Prince's travel in Russia in September 1881. Christian Selmer was also a part of the first two of these interim governments.\n\nIn 1883–1884 Platou was an acting Supreme Court Assessor, and was a part of the Impeachment case against Selmer's Cabinet. Together with the other assessors he voted against the impeachment of Selmer and the entire cabinet, and as such he lost the case.\n\nAfter 1884 he worked in the high court of the Diocese of Kristiania, where he was transferred because his hearing was deteriorating. He died in June 1891 in Kristiania.\n\nReferences\n\n1811 births\n1891 deaths\nJudges from Oslo\nNorwegian civil servants\nNorwegian legal scholars\nAcademic staff of the University of Oslo\nSupreme Court of Norway justices\nGovernment ministers of Norway\nFrederik Christian Stoud\nRoyal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters"}

She was the muse for his 1934 operetta Der singende Traum and his three songs titled An eine schöne Frau, and she also starred opposite him in numerous productions. She made commercial recordings of one solo (Peter, Peter) and several duets with Tauber. She co-starred in four films: The Land of Smiles (1930), Liebeskommando (1931), Bretter, die die Welt bedeuten (1935) and The Sky’s the Limit (1938). Her voice was a high, light and sweet soprano – not big or great, but charming, true and technically assured.\n\nLosseff's early life was comfortable. Her father owned a factory and the family were relatively well off. With the October Revolution,  however, the family were forced to flee to Japan, where they remained for two years, surviving because of the father's They then moved on to Berlin in 1921. Little is known of this period except that Mary bore an illegitimate child, Dimitri, in 1927. This did not affect her plans to make a career on the stage. She took lessons from Bertha Niklas-Kempner and sent Dimitri to boarding school from the age of three for the whole of his childhood. She made her debut at Rudolf Nelson’s Review in 1929, singing ‘Peter, Peter’. This period is described by her then-lover, the pianist and composer Peter Kreuder, in his book Nur Puppen habe keine Tränen.\n\nTauber was in the audience at the Nelson Review and fell in love with Mary, and her voice, at first sight; he felt that she was the singer for whom he had long been searching to star in his planned operetta Der singende Traum. Initially through his influence, she secured major roles in several productions, including Paul Abraham's Viktoria und ihr Husar, Karl Millöcker's Die Dubarry,  Jaromír Weinberger's Frühlingsstürme, Franz Lehár’s Paganini,  Abraham's Ball im Savoy, Emmerich Kálmán’s Gräfin Maritza and of course Der singende Traum. She received critical acclaim, indicating that Tauber's faith was justified. At this time, Mary and Richard were considered a couple, and were expected to marry.\n\nHowever, by 1933, Richard had been hounded from Germany, because his father was Jewish. Mary stayed by his side; they went first to Vienna and then to London. Mary took part in some London productions, but never quite hit it off with British audiences. She had also started drinking heavily, which affected her ability to perform. Domestically and professionally, Mary declined rapidly. Richard detested alcohol, and the nature of the relationship changed. When he married the non-singing British actress Diana Napier in 1936, Mary was devastated and began drinking even more heavily. Mary's last major role was in the South African production of Tauber's Land of Smiles in 1939, but during this tour she was replaced by her understudy Jose Malone. Richard was astonishingly loyal to her until his death. Many of his 60-odd letters repeat the same refrain: 'I wish that everything could have been different'. He also carried on giving Mary a weekly allowance and sending her additional money through the post whenever he could. Despite Richard's never-wavering constancy and repeated attempts to persuade her to stop drinking, Mary virtually disappeared from public performance, barring the occasional concert fixed up by friends. The last documented appearances by her were at the Bournemouth Winter Gardens in 1950.\n\nMary married the actor Brian Buchel in 1938 but the marriage did not succeed, and they separated long before divorce was granted in 1947. She moved to Exmouth in 1943, without Brian, then back to London to a flat in Queensway, Bayswater, in 1944 and remained there on and off until 1948, the year of Richard's death. She also bought a farm in Ireland, which was run by her son Dimitri and which she occasionally visited. She tried to bring her mother, brother and sister to Ireland and to England, but failed, and indeed she never saw her family again. After Richard died, her financial circumstances became desperate for a while, but she found a new partner by the name of Charles Holt, and when that relationship ended, lived with a Willy Bolt in Exmouth. Her National Registration Identity card gives her address as Bryn Cottage, Malltraeth, Anglesey in 1951, and in the same year she married Hugh J Owen in Anglesey. There is no record of a divorce, but by 1955, she was back in London, living in Acton and then Ealing. (There is no evidence that she lived at any time in Soho, sharing a room with a labourer who used the room by day which she used by night, as Diana Napier Tauber claimed.) In 1959, she met Vassia Myronovsky and moved into his house in the Hammersmith district of London, where she stayed until her death of cancer of the lung in July 1972.\n\nMary possessed a loving, homely quality until her old age, although her alcoholism gave rise to a terrible instability. She remained in touch with her son. He never forgave her for withholding information about his father, but later ancestry DNA tests of her grandchildren reveal that the unnamed father of Dimitri was 'central European Jewish', which casts her silence into a different light. She was extremely moved when her grandchildren were born. Her constant drinking and difficult behaviour became too much for Vassia in the end and their relationship deteriorated; during her terminal illness, she was tended by her daughter-in-law. She was cremated at North East Surrey Crematorium in Sutton, Surrey, where her ashes are interred.\n\nDiscography\n‘Peter, Peter’ (part of ‘Das spricht Bände’). Recorded 1929.

The name comes from the fact that the land it sits upon was formerly a working cattle ranch and is located below a large ridge, and thus resembles a valley.\n\nHistory \nLike much of the rest of Irving, the Valley Ranch development was formerly ranch land and largely undeveloped.  However, the introduction of the I-635 loop around Dallas created the opportunity for development of this land into a signature residential and commercial development like Las Colinas to the south.  As the highway was being built westward in the 1970s, local Irving officials were determining how to maximize the potential of the city north of the new interstate highway.  When the highway was joined to 121 and 635 loop in the 1980s, the area development began to soar and continued well into the 2010s.\n\nWith Irving being the home of the old Texas Stadium, it is not surprising that nearby Valley Ranch formerly hosted the practice facilities of the Dallas Cowboys football team (beginning in 1985) who moved to Frisco, Texas, in 2016, and the Dallas Stars hockey team, who have also since moved to Frisco.\n\nToday, a large number of Asian Indians live in Valley Ranch and Las Colinas, and as a result, there are many Indian grocery stores with locations in or adjacent to Valley Ranch including Patel Brothers Farmers Market. Additionally, there are dozens of restaurants offering Indian cuisine about the area.\n\nGeography \nThe area lies in the Trinity River floodplain; however, an extensive levee system on its eastern side separates the river from land, thus making it desirable for development.  In order to maintain flood control and to provide recreation facilities for residents, Valley Ranch has many winding canals with walkways throughout.\n\nValley Ranch is bordered by Coppell, TX to the north and Las Colinas, Irving, TX to the south. It is bordered by Cypress Waters, Dallas, TX to the west and Farmers Branch, TX to the east.  It is located in close proximity to the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and is approximately a 30-minute drive from downtown Dallas.  Its southern border is formed by Interstate 635.\n\nRecreation \nThe Valley Ranch planned community has over five miles of winding, landscaped canal walkways and ponds with parks and an aquatic center.  Cimarron Park is the key Irving city park located within Valley Ranch. This recreational area offers a gymnasium, tennis courts, two basketball courts, outdoor swimming pool and large field for soccer or other activities.  It further offers playground equipment and a covered picnic area with barbecue pit.  One may also access this site by trail.\n\nGovernment \nThe Valley Ranch Association affairs are governed by the Master, Residential and Commercial board of directors. Each board consists of five volunteers who serve two-year terms. The Master board members are appointed by the Residential and Commercial board members. The Residential and Commercial board members are elected by members of the association.  Ultimately, these members report to the city of Irving municipal government.\n\nEducation \nThough technically a part of the city of Irving, Texas, children in Valley Ranch will attend schools in either the Coppell ISD or the Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD.\n\nSchools \n Bernice Chatman Freeman Elementary (Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD)\n Canyon Ranch Elementary (Coppell ISD)\n Tom Landry Elementary (Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD)\n Valley Ranch Elementary (Coppell ISD)\n Barbara Bush Middle School (Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD)\n Ranchview High School (Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Valley Ranch Association \n Irving Convention and Visitors Bureau\n\nGeography of Dallas County, Texas"}

They spend the night together at her apartment, but the next morning she has disappeared, leaving Dustin heartbroken. He visits her family home in Southern California and learns from her younger sister that Christiane ran away at a young age after having an abortion, also finding out that \"Christiane's\" apartment was actually a display room she had broken them into.\n\nDustin returns home to Los Angeles and, after confiding in Phil, a plumber who has seen Dustin at his local pub, about his issues with Christiane, finds success painting portraits of her from memory, idealizing her as his true love. Dustin's best friend, a struggling writer named Buzz, envies his friend's newfound success. After Dustin easily beds Cathy, a woman Buzz has been chasing for two years, Buzz angrily shouts at Dustin and threatens him with a pool cue during a drunken argument.\n\nChristiane returns to the gallery and finds Dustin's paintings of her, including a nude one which she slashes. She then breaks into his apartment and throws blue paint on him. Christiane says that they had a meaningless encounter and complains that the paintings are interfering with her life. Dustin responds that he painted them because their night together meant something to him and he wants to get to know her as a person.\n\nAfter making up with Buzz, Dustin ditches a show planned for him in New York by his manager Paul in order to meet Christiane at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

He led the goldsmith company J. Tostrup of Oslo from 1890 to 1938, having inherited it from his grandfather-in-law Jacob Tostrup. He also served as Norwegian Minister of Industrial Provisioning from 1917 to 1918 and President of the Norwegian Red Cross from 1922 to 1930.\n\nBackground\nHe was born in Alstahaug in Nordland, Norway. He was the son of bailiff Eiler Hagerup Krog Prytz, Sr. (1812–1900) and his wife Anne Margrethe Thomessen (1820–1900). The family moved to Christiania (now Oslo) when he was 12 years old. Prytz went to Kristiania Technical School. After completing his education at the polytechnic college of the University of Hannover, he was an assistant of architects Georg Andreas Bull and Henrik Thrap-Meyer.\n\nCareer\n\nHe started a cooperation with goldsmith Oluf Tostrup, a son of goldsmith Jacob Tostrup and co-owner in his company J. Tostrup. Prytz became formally affiliated with J. Tostrup in 1882, when Oluf Tostrup died. In 1884, after two years of studying, he was promoted from head designer to co-owner.\nWhen Jacob Tostrup died in 1890, Prytz bought the entire company, retaining the tradename. He was an innovative filigree designer, and strengthened the company's position as one of the leading goldsmith companies in Norway. In 1898, he was behind the moving into a new store, Tostrupgården on Karl Johans gate which was built between 1893 and 1898 with Prytz, Waldemar Hansteen and Christian Fürst as architects.\n\nHe served as a deputy representative to the Norwegian Parliament during the term 1900–1903, representing the constituency of Kristiania, Hønefoss og Kongsvinger, and served as Minister of Industrial Provisioning from 1917 to 1918. From 1922 to 1930 he was the President of the Norwegian Red Cross. Prytz also chaired the board of Den norske Husflidsforening from 1907 to 1935, the National Institute of Technology from 1916 to 1935 and the Norwegian Museum of Decorative Arts and Design from 1929 to 1934. He was among the founders of Den norske Husflidsforening and the National Institute of Technology, as well the Norges Gullsmedforbund. He served as a member of the board of the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design from 1884 to 1934, Den norske Husflidsforening from 1891 to 1937 and the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry from 1892 to 1900 and 1904 to 1928.\n\nPersonal life\nIn July 1882, he married Hilda Nicoline Marie Tostrup (1861–1947), a granddaughter of Jacob Tostrup. Prytz was the father of Anne-Margrethe Cappelen Prytz (1888–1960), who was married to Erik Cappelen Knudsen (1882–1954), eldest son of Prime Minister Gunnar Knudsen. He was also the father of Jakob Tostrup Prytz (1886–1962) who followed him into the management of J. Tostrup. He was the grandfather of jewelry designers Grete Prytz Kittelsen and Jakob Tostrup Prytz, jr. He was also an uncle of Eiler Prytz who became a co-owner of J. Tostrup.

{"id": "4107325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline%20of%20first%20orbital%20launches%20by%20country", "title": "Timeline of first orbital launches by country", "text": "This is a timeline of first orbital launches by country. While a number of countries, incl. Canada, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Algeria, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Argentina, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, South Africa, the Philippines, Egypt, Spain, Mexico, Thailand and Chile, have built or launched satellites, as of 2022, eleven countries, incl. the United States, Japan, India, China, Iran, Israel, France, the United Kingdom and South Korea, have had the capability to send objects into orbit with their own launch vehicles. Russia and Ukraine inherited the capability of the space launchers and satellites from the Soviet Union, following its dissolution in 1991. Russia launches its rockets from its own and foreign (Kazakh) spaceports. \n\nUkraine launched only from foreign (Kazakh and Russian) launch facilities until 2015, after which political differences with Russia effectively halted Ukraine's ability to produce orbital rockets.  France became a space power independently, launching a payload into orbit from Algeria, before joining space launcher facilities in the multi-national Ariane project. The United Kingdom became a space power independently following a single payload insertion into orbit from Australia.\n\nTen countries and one inter-governmental organisation (ESA) have a proven orbital launch capability, . Three countries (France, Italy and the United Kingdom) formerly had such an independent capability. In all cases where a country has conducted independent human spaceflights (as of 2021, three — China, the Soviet Union/Russia, and the United States), these launches were preceded by independent uncrewed launch capability.\n\nThe race to launch the first satellite was closely contested by the Soviet Union and the United States, and was the beginning of the Space Race. The launching of satellites, while still contributing to national prestige, is a significant economic activity as well, with public and private rocket systems competing for launches, using cost and reliability as selling points.\n\nList of first orbital launches by country\n\nCountries like Italy are not included since they have not yet developed an orbital rocket from scratch; i.e., an orbital rocket that was designed and engineered in its entirety in the country in question.\n\nPartial contributions to orbital launch systems \nTwo countries, Italy and New Zealand, have contributed in the creation or continuation of orbital launch systems.\n\nNotes\n\nOther launches and projects\nThe above list includes confirmed satellite launches with rockets produced by the launching country, like Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom or the United States. Lists with differing criteria might include the following launches:\n\nFailed launches\n had yet to launch a satellite into orbit independently and its space program suffered three satellite launch failures, the latest being the explosion of a VLS-1 rocket on 22 August 2003 at the Alcântara Launch Centre, which resulted in 21 deaths.\n\nLaunches of non-indigenous launch vehicles\nSome countries have no self-developed rocket systems, but have provided their spaceports for launches of their own and foreign satellites on foreign launchers:\n with the first successful launch from Hammaguir of the French satellite Astérix on 26 November 1965 by French Diamant A. The last orbital launch from Hammaguir was on 15 February 1967 by French Diamant A and there are no further launches scheduled (the first Algerian satellite is AlSAT-1 launched by Russian Kosmos-3M from Plesetsk, Russia on 28 November 2002).\n with the first successful launch from the San Marco platform of its satellite San Marco 2 on 26 April 1967 by US Scout B (the first Italian satellite is San Marco 1 launched by another Scout from Wallops, USA on 15 December 1964). The last orbital launch from San Marco was on 25 March 1988 by US Scout G-1 and there are no further launches scheduled.\n with the first successful launch from Woomera Test Range of its first satellite WRESAT on 29 November 1967 by US Sparta. The second and final successful orbital launch from Woomera was performed on 28 October 1971 by the UK Black Arrow.\n with the first launch after its independence from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 21 January 1992 of the Russian Soyuz-U2 and Progress M-11 (the first Kazakh satellite is KazSat launched by Russian Proton-K from Baikonur on 17 June 2006). Currently the spaceport continues to be utilized for launches of various Russian rockets.\n; a single Pegasus-XL was launched from Orbital Sciences' Stargazer aircraft flying from Gran Canaria Airport in April 1997.\n with a successful launch of a Pegasus-H rocket from Orbital Sciences' Stargazer aircraft flying from Kwajalein Atoll in October 2000. Five ground-based launches were made by SpaceX using Falcon 1 rockets between 2006 and 2009, with the first success on 28 September 2008. Three further Pegasus launches occurred between 2008 and 2012, using the Pegasus-XL configuration. Currently there are no plans announced for a Marshall Islands satellite.\n\nPrivately developed launch vehicles\n  Orbital Sciences Corporation (USA) became the first company to launch a privately developed rocket into orbit, the Pegasus on April 5, 1990. Orbital subsequently developed the Minotaur rocket family.  Orbital joined SpaceX as one of only two private entities to supply the International Space Station with its launch of the Cygnus Orb-D1 mission on its Antares rocket on September 28, 2013.\n  SpaceX (USA) became the second company to launch a rocket into orbit using a rocket developed with private—not government—funds. Its first successful launch was performed on September 28, 2008, by Falcon 1 from the Omelek Island, Marshall Islands and its first launch from US spaceport was Falcon 9 Flight 1 on June 4, 2010, from Cape Canaveral. Its Dragon spacecraft docked with the International Space Station on October 11, 2012, to deliver supplies.\n American private company Rocket Lab successfully launched its Electron rocket from Mahia Launch Center in New Zealand on January 21, 2018, carrying three cubesats into low Earth orbit. This was the first time that a rocket entered orbit after launching from a privately owned and operated spaceport.\n Chinese private company i-Space successfully launched its Hyperbola 1 rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center and sent several small payloads, including the CAS-7B amateur radio satellite into Earth orbit on July 25, 2019.\n Galactic Energy successfully launched its Ceres-1 solid rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center into Sun-synchronous orbit on November 7, 2020, becoming the second Chinese private company capable of launching satellites into orbit.\n Virgin Orbit successfully achieved orbit on January 17, 2021, using their LauncherOne vehicle to deploy 10 CubeSats into Low Earth Orbit for NASA.\n Astra Rocket 3.3 vehicle successfully reached orbit on November 20, 2021, after launching from Pacific Spaceport Complex – Alaska (PSCA) carrying the demonstration payload STP-27AD2 for the United States Space Force.\n Firefly Aerospace launched Firefly Alpha rocket, which successfully reached an orbit lower than the expected one, on October 1, 2022.\n Space Pioneer successfully launched its first rocket Tianlong-2 into orbit on April 2, 2023. It was the first Chinese company that achieved the goal with the liquid rocket.\n LandSpace became a private company with orbital launch capability by successfully launched Zhuque-2, world's first methane-fueled rocket to reach orbit, on July 12, 2023.\n\nSub-orbital launch\n Innospace successfully launched its first rocket HANBIT-TLV into orbit on March 21, 2023 from the Alcantara Space Center in Brazil, making it the first civilian-made space rocket from South Korea. The inertial navigation system from Brazil, called SISNAV, being carried onboard as a payload of HANBIT-TLV, functioned properly, thus making it South Korea's first private launch service provider.\n\nOther launches\n launched its first satellite, named Astérix, from Algeria in late 1965.\n launched its first satellite, named Ohsumi, in early 1970.\n launched its first satellite in early 1975.\n\nAbandoned projects\n/ was developing larger designs in the Aggregat series as early as 1940. A combination of A9 to A12 components could have produced orbital capability as early as 1947 if work had continued. Further preliminary development of numerous rocket space launchers and re-usable launch systems (Sänger II, etc.) took place after WWII, although these were never realized as national or European projects. Also, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the private German company OTRAG tried to develop low-cost commercial space launchers. Only the sub-orbital tests of the first prototypes of the rockets were carried out.\n did not proceed with a 1946 proposal to develop German V-2 technology into the \"Megaroc\" system to be launched in 1949. The UK also developed the Black Arrow rocket system and successfully launched a satellite in 1971, shortly after the program had been cancelled.\n had developed the gun-based space launchers Martlet and GLO as the joint Canadian-American Project HARP in the 1960s. The rockets were never tested. In fact, in different periods, they worked in cooperation with Australia, Brazil, South Korea and the United Kingdom.\n developed the space launcher RSA-3 in the 1980s. This rocket was tested 3 times without a satellite payload in 1989 and 1990. The program was postponed and canceled in 1994.\n Iraq claimed to have developed and tested \"Al-Abid\", a three-stage space launch vehicle without a payload or its upper two stages on 5 December 1989. The rocket's design had a clustered first stage composed of five modified scud rockets strapped together and a single scud rocket as the second stage in addition to a SA-2 liquid-fueled rocket engine as the third stage. The video tape of a partial launch attempt which was retrieved by UN weapons inspectors, later surfaced showing that the rocket prematurely exploded 45 seconds after its launch.\n previous attempts at developing space launcher based on their Condor missile were scrapped in 1993.\n The VLS-1 was cancelled after decades of development and high expenditures with poor results and a failed association with Ukraine that slowed the program for years.\n tried to develop space launcher as part of its various ballistic missile programs in the second half of the 20th century. In different periods, they worked either independently or in cooperation with Algeria, Argentina, Canada, Iraq and North Korea.\n developed the space launcher Capricornio (Capricorn) in the 1990s. The rocket was related to the Condor missile from Argentina and its test, scheduled for 1999/2000, was not conducted. As a result, in different periods, they worked in cooperation with Japan and the United States.\n Swiss Space Systems company planned to develop the micro satellite launcher-spaceplane SOAR by 2018 but went bankrupt. Thus, in different periods, they worked in cooperation with Chile, Poland and Ukraine.\n\nOther projects\n developed an orbital rocket called Tronador II, whose maiden flight is expected to take place in the next four years as of late 2020.\n's ATSpace developed an orbital launch vehicle called Kestrel, tentatively being launched in 2022 from Whalers Way.\n \n's Gilmour Space Technologies developed an orbital launch vehicle called Eris, scheduled to be launched in 2023.\n announced that it would launch its VLM rocket from the Alcântara Launch Center in 2025.\n planned to launch military and security satellites. The first phase began in 2022.\n planned to launch military and security satellites. The first phase will begin in 2024.\n announced that it would launch some satellites in 2024 or any later year.\n Orbex developed its Prime launch vehicle, whose first launch was planned in 2023 from Sutherland spaceport.\n Blue Origin developed its New Glenn launch vehicle, whose first launch was planned for sometime in 2023.\n The private company PLD Space developed the Miura 5 orbital launch vehicle, whose first launch is planned for 2024.\n  OrbitX, a private company of the Philippines, planned to develop Haribon, a biofuel-powered launch vehicle.\n  The private company of Malaysia Independence-X Aerospace developed an orbital launch vehicle called DNLV, being launched in 2023.\n  Thai Space Consortium developed a satellite called TSC-Pathfinder, being launched in 2023.\n 's Institute Of Aviation developed a rocket named ILR-33 Bursztyn (ILR-33 Amber).\n  announced that it would launch some satellites some time in 2024.\n  planned to launch several rockets starting in 2023.\n  launched a rocket in early 2023 from the space center in Brazil.\n  planned to launch some satellites beginning in 2024.\n\nSatellite operators\nMany other countries, such as Mexico, Poland, Chile, Japan and India, launched their own satellites on one of the foreign launchers listed above, the first being British owned and operated; American-built satellite Ariel 1, which was launched by a US rocket in April 1962. In September 1962, the Canadian satellite, Alouette-1, was launched by a US rocket, but unlike Ariel 1, it was constructed by Canada.\n\nSee also\nList of orbital launch systems\nList of missiles by country\nOrbital spaceflight\nSatellite\nSpaceport (including timeline of first orbital launches by spaceport)\nDiscovery and exploration of the Solar System (including exploration by country)\nTimeline of first artificial satellites by country\nTimeline of Solar System exploration\nTimeline of space exploration\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nFirst Satellites Launched By Spacefaring Nations, Anthony R.

In 1982, the 1979 Tozzi/Bigazzi tune \"Gloria\" became a platinum, Number One smash for Branigan and launched her career. Two years later, Branigan would take the 1977 Tozzi/Bigazzi song \"Ti Amo\" to the top of the charts in several countries. And Bigazzi was the co-writer of Branigan's biggest international hit, \"Self Control\" (the only one of the four written in English and recorded by Branigan as written). For \"Mama,\" as for \"Ti Amo,\" Branigan's English lyrics were written by Diane Warren, a frequent collaborator on Branigan's early albums.

{"id": "4107359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas%20A.%20Spragens", "title": "Thomas A. Spragens", "text": "Thomas Arthur Spragens ( ; April 25, 1917 – February 11, 2006) was an American administrator who was the 17th president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. A graduate of the University of Kentucky, Spragens worked for the state and federal government early in his career, before joining the staff at Stanford University as a presidential advisor. He was the president of Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri, for a five-year term, and left Stephens to go to Centre in 1957.\n\nThe first Centre president who was not a member of the clergy, Spragens worked to lessen the ties between the college and the Presbyterian Church, which led to a significant rise in students reporting that they were non-denominational; it also led to attendance at chapel becoming optional for students. Spragens was an effective fundraiser for the school; his Fund for the Future Campaign ultimately raised $34 million. He was instrumental in the integration of the school, and admitted Centre's first black student in 1962. The same year, he led an effort to consolidate the school's women's department, formerly the Kentucky College for Women, onto Centre's campus. Many parts of campus were upgraded during his presidency; after twenty years, three quarters of Centre's facilities had been either built or renovated. During his term, which ended in 1981, Centre's student enrollment and faculty numbers both nearly doubled, its endowment increased, and the property value of its campus rose.\n\nHe was selected by two governors to be a part of commissions which studied higher education in Kentucky, and was a part of the American Association of Colleges and Universities, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and the American Council on Education at different times. He was active in Democratic Party politics, and was a delegate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention in support of Senator Eugene McCarthy. Additionally, he was a part of an effort which culminated in the 1962 founding of what is now the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference, of which Centre remained a charter member until 2011.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nSpragens was born on April 25, 1917, in Lebanon, Kentucky. He was the third of seven children in his family. His father, William Henry Spragens, was a lawyer and circuit court judge from Casey County, Kentucky, and his mother, Lillian Brewer Spragens, was from Lancaster, Kentucky. He attended Lebanon High School, graduating in 1934, and was recruited by then-president Charles J. Turck to attend Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, alongside three classmates with whom he formed a locally popular singing quartet. Turck's hope was that the four of them would attend Centre and replace the \"Centre College Quartet\", the members of which were soon graduating. Spragens's three classmates decided to attend Centre but he ultimately opted for the University of Kentucky (UK) in Lexington instead, though he did join the glee club at UK. He enrolled in, and attended, the University's College of Commerce (now the Gatton College of Business and Economics) for a year and a half, but afterwards transferred to the College of Arts and Sciences and majored in economics. He graduated from UK in 1938. After a summer employed by the Kentucky state government, he won a public administration fellowship and began graduate work at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. He completed only one year of his graduate program; after spending the summer following the first year working for the Bureau of the Budget (now the Office of Management and Budget), he decided to forgo the second year in favor of a permanent position with the Bureau.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career, 1940–1957\nSpragens worked for the federal government from 1940 to 1945 in multiple positions, including in his new permanent job as a senior analyst at the Bureau of the Budget, and in a job with the Foreign Economic Administration, which operated during World War II. In mid-1946, Spragens left his government positions to work at Stanford University as an assistant to the college president and as Stanford's representative in Washington, D.C. In this position, he assisted two presidents: Donald Tresidder, who originally hired him, and Wallace Sterling, who took over after Tresidder's death. He helped the college to manage its increasing enrollment numbers, which spiked from 4,500 in June 1946 to 7,200 in November of the same year. Spragens intended to remain in this position for only one to two years, and afterwards return to government work, but ended up working there for five years.\n\nIn 1951, Spragens left Stanford to accept a position as the secretary and treasurer of the Fund for the Advancement of Education, which was a newly-formed subsidiary of the Ford Foundation. He worked in this position for just over a year before he was offered the presidency of Stephens College, a women's college in Columbia, Missouri. An announcement of his hiring was made to students and faculty at Stephens on November 1, 1952, and he began in this role exactly one month later, on December 1. At Stephens, he implemented a plan which saw the use of closed-circuit television as an academic aid, for which the school received \"wide notice in educational circles\". Television was used mainly as a supplement to seminar-style classes with small numbers of students, and it allowed lecturers to speak to multiple sections of a class simultaneously. During this time, he was selected to be a part of a commission that produced a report, \"The Church and Higher Education\", to the Presbyterian Synod of North Carolina, which was completed in July 1955. He was a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools's commission on colleges universities and the board of directors of Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri; he was elected to the latter position on May 28, 1956. In his final week at Stephens, the college announced a 40-year campus relocation project at a total cost of $12 million (equivalent to $ million in ) with the eventual goal of abandoning its current facilities and constructing new instructional, residential, and athletic buildings at a site near U.S. Route 63.\n\nIn 1957, he was contacted by Don Campbell, a friend of his and chairman of the trustee presidential search committee at Centre, regarding the school's vacant presidency. He was offered the job, and despite having turned down a similar offer from what he later called a \"stronger\" college, he accepted the position at Centre. He was replaced by dean of instruction James G. Rice as acting president upon his departure on November 11, 1957.\n\nPresident of Centre College, 1957–1981\nSpragens was announced as Centre's next president by their board of trustees on August 22, 1957. On November 11, he began his term as the 17th president of Centre College. In doing so, he became the fourth president in the college's history who was not an ordained minister, the first who was not a member of the clergy at all, and the youngest in the college's history. He spent his first full day on campus the following day, when he presided over his first faculty meeting, and addressed the student body for the first time at a convocation on November 19. He was formally inaugurated in a ceremony on the morning of April 21, 1959, which included an inaugural address given by Stanford president Wallace Sterling.\n\nIn 1959, he introduced a ten-year plan with the goals of increasing the college's enrollment (with the specific goal of 750 students), adding to the faculty, and increasing the number of majors offered by the college. The following year, the college announced a $6.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) fundraising campaign in celebration of Centre's 150-year anniversary, a marked increase from the $20,000 () to $25,000 () typically raised every year. On June 9, 1958, he received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Westminster College, which was conferred upon him at their commencement ceremony. After beginning his term, he immediately declared that the school would move towards full integration and not discriminate by race when determining admissions, and the college admitted its first black student when Timothy Kusi, a Ghanaian student who transferred from Kentucky State College (now Kentucky State University), enrolled in 1962. This change was received well by much of the campus community. The campus of the former Kentucky College for Women, at the time operating as Centre's women's department, closed that same year, at which point it was consolidated onto Centre's campus, with Spragens presiding over the merger. He hired Shirley Anne Walker, a French language professor who became Centre's first black faculty member at the start of the 1971–1972 academic year.\n\nAs football grew more popular at Centre during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Spragens sought to keep the college's priorities on academics rather than athletics. After he was announced as president in August 1957, he said that he would continue the existing policy of lessened emphasis on athletics, saying that they were a \"corollary aspect\" of the school. His scholarship policy stipulated that financial awards would not be given solely for athletics, but rather to all students based on merit and need. He advocated for the creation of a new athletic association which would eliminate gate receipts; Centre was joined in this association by Washington and Lee University, Southwestern University at Memphis (now Rhodes College), and the University of the South, with Washington University in St. Louis added later the same year as the league's fifth charter member. This association ultimately became the College Athletic Conference (now the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference) and was formally founded on September 1, 1962. Centre remained a member of the conference until 2011, when they left, along with six other SCAC schools and one independent school, to form the Southern Athletic Association. During the 1960s, Spragens decided to end the agreement under which Centre leased its football field to Danville High School, and underwent a facilities exchange with the local school district by which the Centre women's campus was given to the district and the old Danville High School site was given to the college.\n\nSpragens was supportive of peaceful protests held by students on campus and around the city; his \"'good citizenship' policy\" took effect in the 1960s, and student protests increased in frequency as the decade continued, particularly with respect to racial segregation and the Vietnam War. In December 1966, he introduced a plan under which classes at Centre would be held during four days of the week, rather than five, as part of a trimester system that was in effect for some time beginning with the fall semester of the 1966–1967 academic year. This trimester system, referred to as \"The New Curriculum\", consisted of two terms of regular length, during which students would take four courses, with a six-week two-course winter term in between. He was selected as a delegate to the 1968 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago, after serving as the chair of the Boyle County Democratic Convention and attending the state convention. He did both in support of Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, though McCarthy eventually lost the nomination to Vice President Hubert Humphrey, also of Minnesota. Following the Kent State shootings on May 4, 1970, he declared all classes suspended on May 8, and addressed much of the student body and faculty on the campus lawn.\n\nMany of the changes that took place on Centre's campus during Spragens's presidency were long-lasting. Numerous buildings were constructed or upgraded during his time in office, including the Grace Doherty Library (which took the place of Old Main, which was demolished), the new Young Hall, Sutcliffe Hall, the Regional Arts Center (now the Norton Center for the Arts), Alumni Memorial Gymnasium, fraternity residences, and multiple dormitory buildings. After twenty years of Spragens's presidency, three quarters of the buildings on campus had been constructed or renovated. These upgrades increased the property value of the campus to $21.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ) by the time he left office. An effective fundraiser, he led the Fund for the Future campaign, which ultimately raised about $34 million (equivalent to $ million in ) for the college. A chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society (of which Spragens was a member) opened at Centre during Spragens' tenure. In 1961, Centre purchased land from the city of Danville at a cost of $175,000 (); a federal law that was new at the time allowed the city to start a community development project with funding totaling $2.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) as a direct result. Under Spragens, the college contributed to the city's economy, with one estimate stating that five to ten percent of the city's business revenue was generated by the college during fiscal year 1980–1981.\n\nHis presidency ended upon his resignation, which became effective November 16, 1981. Provost Edgar C. Reckard finished the academic year as interim president; Spragens was formally succeeded by Richard L. Morrill on June 1, 1982. He worked as a fundraiser for, and advisor to, the college for six months following his resignation.\n\nDuring his time at Centre, Spragens was a member of a number of other institutions related to higher education, including the Kentucky Independent College Foundation, Independent College Funds of America, the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. He was the director of the American Council on Education for three years, and as the director of the Southern University Union for a time. During his presidency, he was selected as part of two commissions, appointed by Governors Bert Combs and Ned Breathitt, to study higher education in Kentucky. On two occasions, he was asked to interview with the search committee for the presidency of the University of Kentucky, but never received a formal offer, and he was contacted by Kentucky State University with a possibility of being their interim president after he retired from Centre. He ended up as a consultant for one year to the newly-hired president of Kentucky State, Raymond Burse, a Centre alumnus himself. He received honorary degrees from a number of colleges and universities: Westminster College, the University of Kentucky, the University of Alabama, Berea College, and Kentucky State University, in addition to Centre.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\nSpragens met Catharine Smallwood, a native of Oxford, Mississippi, and an alumna of the University of Mississippi, in the early 1940s and the pair married on May 24, 1941. The couple had two sons, Thomas Jr. and David, and one daughter, Barbara. David, who was their youngest child, graduated from Centre in 1973, during his father's presidency.\n\nIn an interview shortly following his resignation, Spragens stated that his personal hobbies included playing tennis and golf, as well as water skiing. He was Presbyterian, and had been an elder in the Presbyterian Church since the age of 29. He was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa honor societies. In 1990, Thomas and Catharine received the Honorary Alumni Award from Centre.\n\nSpragens died on February 11, 2006, in Columbia, South Carolina, at the age of 88. His memorial service was scheduled for March 4, 2006, at the First Presbyterian Church in Danville. He is buried in Danville's Bellevue Cemetery.\n\nLegacy\n\nDuring his 24-year tenure as president, the college's enrollment nearly doubled, from 380 students to nearly 700, and the size of its faculty followed the same trend, increasing from 38 members to 68. Centre's endowment also grew, from $2.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to $18 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Three of Kentucky's four Rhodes Scholars at the time of his resignation had graduated from Centre over the previous fifteen years. After his retirement from the presidency he joined the Kentucky Council on Higher Education, the boards of numerous organizations including Shaker Village, Leadership Kentucky, Presbyterian Homes and Services, and Pikeville College (now the University of Pikeville), and was a city commissioner in Danville. \n\nHis tenure saw the college become more distanced from the church than in the past, as the portion of the college's budget obtained from the church decreased and chapel attendance became voluntary for students beginning in 1965. Two years later, he was elected moderator of the Northern Synod of Kentucky and recommended that Centre remove many of its remaining ties to the Presbyterian Church. In 1968, Centre withdrew from the Kentucky Synod for financial reasons and the following year it removed its policies which required the president and most board members to be Presbyterian. The effects of this were seen on the student body in the following years, with the percentage of students reporting themselves as Presbyterian falling from 32% in 1967 to 17% in 1971, and the percentage of students reporting themselves as non-denominational rising from 0.5% to 27% in the same time period. His presidency is remembered for his successful fundraising efforts and for the numerous buildings that were constructed. The Thomas A. Spragens Rare Book Room and Archives, located in the Grace Doherty Library at Centre, is named in his honor.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1917 births\n2006 deaths\nBurials in Bellevue Cemetery (Danville, Kentucky)\nFranklin D.

Later, he worked as a producer, and produced many of the BBC Radio 1 John Peel sessions from 1981 to 1994.\n\nLife and career\nBorn in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, Griffin attended Ross-on-Wye Grammar School. He played in local bands with future fellow Mott the Hoople member Overend Watts and it was during this time he gained the nickname \"Buffin\". Griffin's bands during this time included the Silence and the Charles Kingsley Creation. He appeared on two singles in 1966 by Yemm and the Yemen. Also in 1966, again with Watts and also with Mick Ralphs, Griffin played in the Doc Thomas Group. Successful in Italy, the group performed until the summer of 1968 when further changes of band personnel took place. Organist Verden Allen was added and the group changed its name to the Shakedown Sound and then to Silence. In 1969 they moved to London and with the addition of Ian Hunter, in June 1969 Mott The Hoople were formed.\n\nFollowing the departure of Ian Hunter and Mick Ralphs, Griffin, along with Overend Watts and Morgan Fisher re-formed Mott with guitarist Ray Major and vocalist Nigel Benjamin. Following the departure of Benjamin in 1976 the remaining members regrouped as British Lions, with former Medicine Head member and songwriter John Fiddler, until their demise around 1978. During the 1980s, Griffin produced albums for Hanoi Rocks and The Cult, and the Department S hit, 'Is Vic There?', among others (such as New Model Army).\n\nGriffin also produced numerous BBC Radio 1 John Peel sessions from 1981 to 1994. These included:\n\n The first professional recording session for Pulp in 1981.\n A session by The Smashing Pumpkins that included the track, \"Girl Named Sandoz\", which was featured on Pisces Iscariot (in the liner notes, Billy Corgan derisively referred to Griffin as 'Mott The Nipple').\n An early session for Nirvana, which appeared on their Incesticide collection.\n A session for Carcass in 1989.\n A session for Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark in 1983.\n\nAged 58, Griffin was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.\nIn January 2009 it was confirmed that Griffin and the other original members of Mott the Hoople would reform for three 40th anniversary reunion concerts in October 2009. Due to popular demand, the reunion was eventually extended to five shows. Having been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Griffin only performed during the encores. The Pretenders drummer Martin Chambers, a fellow Herefordshire native and friend of the band, played the main set and also covered for Griffin on the 2013 tour.\n\nDale's brother Bob, also a drummer, plays in Hereford Punk band, Terminal Rage.\n\nGriffin died in his sleep on 17 January 2016 at the age of 67, exactly a week after former collaborator David Bowie died from cancer.\n\nSee also\nPeel Sessions 1979–1983\nThe Peel Sessions 1988–90\n\nReferences\n\n1948 births\n2016 deaths\nEnglish rock drummers\nBritish male drummers\nEnglish record producers\nPeople from Ross-on-Wye\nMusicians from Herefordshire\nPeople with Alzheimer's disease\nMott the Hoople members\nGlam rock musicians\n20th-century British businesspeople\nBritish Lions (band) members"}

The rifles were manufactured by the German firearms manufacturer Blaser.\n\nDesign\nThe LRT (Long Range Tactical), LRS 2 (Long Range Sporter 2) and Tactical 2 rifles are straight-pull bolt-action take down sniper rifles. The straight-pull action design was introduced in the Blaser R93 hunting rifle line. These actions allows for faster follow-up shots compared to traditional turn bolt actions. The rifles are designed to fire small groups (sub 0.07 mrad (7 mm at 100 m; 0.25 moa) with factory match ammunition.\n\nThe LRS 2 version, comes chambered in .223 Remington, 6mm Norma BR, 6.5×55mm, .308 Winchester and .300 Winchester Magnum.\n\nAn uncommon part of its design is that it is a straight-pull bolt-action rather than a turn-bolt, which allows for much faster follow-up shots.  The 14-lug radial collet ensures the centering of the cartridge when fed into the chamber assisting in its accuracy. Barrel changes by an experienced person can take place in under 60 seconds.\n\nThe Tactical 1 (very low production) or 2 version is available in .223 Remington, .308 Winchester, .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum and has a larger frame, action and barrel to accommodate the use of the .338 Lapua Magnum chambering. The sight is mounted directly to the barrel as normal, however, the design allows the barrel and sight to be removed from the body of the rifle by undoing the two hex screws with a hex key accessed from under the body. This allows the rifle to be carried in a more compact fashion and can be reassembled easily in less than 30 seconds. The safety catch is mounted on the rear of the bolt and reveals a large red dot when pushed forward and up to the \"fire\" position. One feature of the bolt is that when unloaded and no magazine inserted, the safety has to be pushed forward slightly in order to pull the bolt back. The 5 round magazines in .308 calibre sit flush with the underside of the body when inserted.\n\nVariants \nR93 Tactical (1st gen) (1993-1997)  Synthetic body model. Also available under the designations R93 UIT made for UIT competitions (later ISSF) and R93 CISM made for CISM competitions. Detachable staggered feed double stack 10-round box magazine. Chassis and barrel compatible with the regular R93. UIT and CISM versions came with diopter sights.\nR93 Tactical LRS2 (1997-2005) Detachable box magazine, Single Stack (5-round). The 2nd gen is a ruggeriezed version, also known as Long Range Supporter 2 (LRS-2). New magazine design. Some of the different calibers may require different magazines. LRS stands for Long Range Sporter, but the model is sometimes also referred to as LRT for Long Range Tactical.\nR93 Tactical LRS2 .338LM Large chassis version to facilitate .338 Lapua Magnum.\nBlaser R93 Tactical 2 (2005-) Large chassis version, available in .223 Rem, .308 Win, .300 WinMag, .338LM.\nR93 Duo Mod.

It was among their most successful records in terms of units sold. The album is analysed track-by-track by Geto Boys in Brian Coleman's book Check the Technique. We Can't Be Stopped was certified Platinum in early 1992.\n\nRecording\nWe Can't Be Stopped took only a few weeks to record. During the recording of the album, DJ Ready Red, one of the original Geto Boys members, left the group for personal reasons.\n\nIn We Can't Be Stopped, each member of the group has three solo tracks. Three tracks have all three members on the rapping roster, including a short verse from DJ Ready Red on the title track.\n\nAlbum cover\nThe album cover is a graphic picture of member Bushwick Bill in the hospital. Bill was shot in the eye as he and his girlfriend tussled over a gun. Bushwick Bill wanted her to kill him and during the altercation he was shot as both hands were on the gun. The other two Geto Boys members and the group's management team took Bill out of the hospital room in order to take the picture, removing his eyepatch and intravenous drip in the process. Bill later expressed regret over the album cover, saying, \"It still hurts me to look at that cover because that was a personal thing I went through... I still feel the pain from the fact I've got a bullet in my brain... I think it was pretty wrong to do it, even though I went along with the program at first.\"\n\nReception\n\nFred Thomas from AllMusic called the album \"[the group's] most visceral work, rising to platinum success against the odds and inspiring innovation in the genre with its powerful and distinctively Southern perspective on what rap could be.\" James Bernard of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a \"B,\" saying that much of the   “album stings, and their raw honesty has driven it onto the Billboard pop Top 40...\"\n\nThe track \"Mind Playing Tricks on Me\" has been singled out for praise. Pitchfork Media ranked the song #45 on its Top 200 Tracks of the 1990s list, with reviewer Tom Breihan writing \"This track established the South as a serious force in the music, proving that these Texans could do dark better than anyone on either coast.\" XXL ranked the song #14 on its list of the 250 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs from 1990 to 1999. The Source gave the track its \"Best Song\" award in 1991.

The Mexican census of 2020 reported a population of 2,245 inhabitants.\n\nClimate\nThe climate  is heavily influenced by the Pacific Ocean, which moderates the temperatures year round. \nPescadero  is bordered by the Sierra de la Laguna mountains to the East. In the huerta area of Pescadero (the farm land area,) palm-lined roads and farms co-exist with low-density private residences. A common sight in the huerta are the chili and basil fields. Most of these crops are grown for export.\n\nCommercial farming in Pescadero flourishes because of an ample supply of underground water funneled down from the mountains. Air from the Pacific Ocean is pushed up the Sierra de la Laguna mountain range and is met with hotter air from the Gulf of California, resulting in frequent mountain rain storms that persist through the summer and fall.\n\nSurfing\nSurf breaks punctuate the length of the peninsula's Pacific coast. Two of the best are located in El Pescadero: Los Cerritos and San Pedrito. Both beaches have right breaks. Los Cerritos is better for beginner and intermediate surfers, while San Pedrito is considered an advanced surfer's break because of its rocky bottom and strong currents.\n\nFestivals\nEach March, the puebla hosts the Chili and Strawberry Festival, celebrating and promoting the area's agriculture. Organic produce and plants are offered for sale, food is available to sample, and agricultural products and tools are on display from vendors. The festival includes a dance, crowning of a queen, and a cabalgante - a procession of horse and riders from Todos Santos to the festival in Pescadero.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n2010 census tables: INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática\n\nPopulated places in Baja California Sur\nLa Paz Municipality (Baja California Sur)"}
{"id": "4107390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaser%20R93", "title": "Blaser R93", "text": "The Blaser R93 is a straight-pull action precision rifle offered in a multitude of calibers and barrel lengths manufactured by the German firearms manufacturer Blaser. Designed by Blasers' designer Mr. Meinhard Zeh in 1993, it had a number of features rare on modern hunting rifles, including a manual cocking system and a proprietary Blaser saddle scope mount for mounting the optic directly to the quick-change barrel\n\nIn 2002, more than 100,000 complete Blaser R93 rifles had been produced. By 2017, more than 200,000 R93 rifles had been produced, but it is not clear whether the R93 Tactical variant is included in these numbers.\n\nHistory \nThe predecessor of the R93 was the 60 degree turn bolt action Blaser R84, which was discontinued after the introduction of the R93 in 1993.\n\nThe successor of R93, Blaser R8, was introduced in 2008. Production of the R93 ended by 2017.\n\nDesign features\n\nModularity \nThe Blaser R93 is a truly modular system built around an aluminium alloy frame, offering differing stocks and barrels varying length and thickness available in chamberings from .22 LR to .375 H&H Magnum/.416 Remington Magnum/.458 Winchester Magnum size. It also came in caliber 28 (13.97 mm; 0.550 in) as a shotgun/slug barrel.\n\nThe barrel has a quick-change design which lets the user switch barrels using two screws and a hex key. Different bolt heads for different groups of calibers and magazine inserts are also user changeable, making the Blaser R93 a modular firearm capable of using a multitude of calibers in its chassis. A R93 Rimfire conversion kit was also available in .22 Long Rifle and .17 HMR consisting of a new magazine, barrel, bolt head and bolt catch insert.\n\nThe rifle has a shorter overall length compare to more traditional designs due to the trigger being placed under the magazine. The rifle also has a reputation for being easy to disassemble and reassemble which can be an advantage when doing maintenance or during travelling, and has a reputation for having a repeatable zero upon reassembly.\n\nScope mounts \nThe Blaser is unique because the scope mounts on the barrel instead of the receiver. A Scope/barrel assembly can be removed and replaced with no change in zero. In 2009, Blaser and Carl Zeiss AG began offering a scope that switches on a red dot when the R93/R8 are cocked (\"Zeiss Illumination Control/iC\"). The iC system is based on the Zeiss rail.\n\nTrigger \nTo avoid accidents with set triggers, Blaser offers the R93 only with a direct trigger, also known as single-stage triggers. The manual cocking system, or \"de-cocking safety\", enables the shooter to securely carry the weapon, only cocking the rifle just before the shot.\n\nPer US importer armusa.com, \nhttp://armusa.com/SigarmsRifles6.htm\n\n\"Also contributing to the Blaser's performance are its patented sear-free trigger mechanism and completely free-floated barrel.\" A free-floated barrel is a common modern accurizing technique, but searless triggers are quite novel.\n\nBolt design \nThe R93 straight-pull bolt action locks by a 14-lug radial collet in a 360 degrees groove in the barrel and is designed to withstand pressures significantly exceeding the Mauser 98–type bolt-action rifles. The Blaser R93 displays a locking surface of  compared to  for the Mauser 98. The bolt is symmetric and self-centering, providing a basis for increased accuracy. The stressed parts are made out of hammer forged steel and plasma nitrided to provide corrosion resistance and mechanical strength. In addition to the primary lockup by the bolt head into the barrel, the R93 also features a secondary lockup for added safety. While secondary lockup on turn bolt rifles is achieved with the bolt handle, secondary lockup on the R93 this is achieved with a camplate which supports the locked action against a hardened steelplate in the rear part of the magazine-box. The bolt knob uses M6 threads, enabling the use of aftermarket bolt knobs.\n\nAvailable chamberings \nBelow is a list of some of the available factory chamberings for the R93. Several different barrel profiles were also available, such as Standard, Octagonal, Semi Weight, \"Stutzen\", Match or Safari\n Letters in parentheses corresponding stamping on the bolt head.\n\nHornet (HO)\n .22 Hornet\n\nMini (MI) caliber group\n .204 Ruger\n .222 Rem\n .223 Rem\n\nStandard (ST) caliber group\n 22-250\n 243 Win\n 5.6×57mm\n 6 mm Norma BR\n 6mm Rem\n 6×62mm Frères\n .25-06 Rem\n 6.5×55mm\n 6.5×57\n 6.5×65 RWS\n .270 Win\n 7×57\n 7×64mm\n .308 Win\n .30-06 Springfield\n 8×57mm\n 9.3×62mm\n .45 Blaser\n\nMedium (ME) caliber group\n 6.5×68mm\n 7.5×55mm\n 8×68mm S\n 9.3×64mm Brenneke\n\nMagnum (MA) caliber group\n .257 Weatherby Magnum\n .264 Winchester Magnum\n .270 Winchester Short Magnum\n 7 mm Rem Mag\n .300 Win Mag\n .300 Weatherby Magnum\n .300 WSM\n .338 Win Mag\n .375 H&H Magnum\n .416 Rem Mag\n .458 Lott\n\nUltra Magnum (UM) caliber group\n 7 mm STW\n .300 Rem Ultra Mag\n\nJeffery (JE) caliber group\n .500 Jeffery\n\nSwiss (CH) caliber group\n 10.3×60R Swiss (single shot)\n\nShot (28) caliber group\n Caliber 28 (13.97 mm; 0.550 in) shotgun/slug barrel.\n\nSuccessors \nThe R93 was upgraded to the Blaser R8 introduced in 2008, which has a detachable box magazine/trigger combination. Production of complete R93 rifles ceased in 2016. The Blaser R8 displays an enlarged locking surface of  compared to  of the R93. While the R93 collet has a locking angle of about 50 degrees, the angle of the R8 has been steepened to almost 90 degrees. Further the radial collet opens differently. This results in a less smooth operating bolt of the R8 when compared to the R93 series and some weight increase. Other differences are that the R8 is a little heavier and is offered in a wider range of chamberings. Parts for the R93 in general do not fit the R8 series rifles, except for scope mounts.\n\nRecalls \nIn 2000, a recall was announced on R93 rifles delivered with plastic bolt carriers. According to Blaser, only 0.4% of all R93 rifles had been delivered with plastic bolt carriers, and only on the R93 Offroad model. Due to the increased risk of accidents, Blaser offered to replace all such plastic bolt carriers with a regular aluminum bolt carrier for free.\n\nIn May 2003, Blaser issued a recall on all R93 rifles sold in the United States, except the UIT, CISM, and LRS/LRS2 models, because non-stainless steel pins inadvertently had been used in some trigger units. Owners were urged to have their rifles inspected by Blaser's US representative to see if their trigger unit was affected, and if so be changed from a non-stainless to a stainless one.\n\nIncidents \nIn 1994, after a shooting accident near Koblenz in Germany, the R93 was criticised with claims that it could not withstand high pressures, and that the bolt would unlock when excessive pressures were generated.\n\nIn August 2003, 41-year-old Norwegian Jan Sørlie had an accident where his R93 chambered for 8×68mm S exploded, resulting in loss of an eye and a skull fracture requiring titanium replacement. Sørlie reported that had used handloaded ammunition loaded with  Norma MRP powder and a  projectile.\n\nIn January 2004, 38-year-old German Albrecht Huf had an accident near Koblenz in Germany where his R93 chambered in .300 Weatherby Magnum exploded. Huf sustained injury to his thumb, jaw and zygomatic bone. He claimed to have used Weatherby factory ammunition only. An investigation by the German DEVA institute concluded that handloaded .300 Weatherby Magnum ammunition had been used that greatly exceeded the maximum safe gas pressure for the round.\n\nIn July 2009, Spaniard Jesus Nieto had an accident near Madrid in Spain where his R93 rifle chambered for 7mm Remington Magnum exploded, causing the bolt carrier to hit and damage his maxilar bone. The accident was determined by the shooter to be due to faulty ammunition leaving a fired bullet stuck in the barrel, causing an explosion\non the subsequent shot. The shooter stated that he had used Remington Safari Grade commercial ammunition.\n\nIn July 2014, 69-year-old Christer Svensson experienced an accident where his R93 chambered for .30-06 Springfield exploded while loading his rifle on a shooting range near Bollnäs in Sweden, resulting in the bolt hitting his face. Svensson was using Norma factory ammunition. He turned in the rifle to Blaser, but wanted the Swedish National Forensic Centre to investigate the matter. However, he later agreed to the wish of Blaser and its Swedish distributors that all technical investigation would be performed by the German DEVA institute. The DEVA report concluded that the damages to the firearm almost certainly came from a combination of an overpressure and a problem with the casing of the cartridge. Svensson told the Swedish hunting and firearms magazine Svensk Jakt that he had difficulties getting his firearm back from the testing, and that it had been modified when he finally received it. He stated that the chamber and bolt head had been chopped off, and that the barrel did not have a stamped serial number anymore, and claimed the serial number appeared to have been reapplied by hand. He also claimed his rifle originally had a front sight mounted to it which was missing on the returned barrel.\n\nIn August 2014, Svensk Jakt wrote that another Swede, Tony Kristoffersson, had experienced an explosion with his R93 while on a Beaver hunt the same year. He described that his rifle had made a clicking sound as if it had failed to fire, but exploded when he tried to pull the bolt back, which resulted in the bolt hitting his hand. The Swedish Blaser distributor later stated that while it is possible to pull the trigger without the bolt being fully locked into battery, the firing pin is designed such that it will not hit the primer with sufficient force to ignite the cartridge.\n\nSee also \n Heym SR 30\n Lynx 94\n Rößler Titan 16\n Ross rifle\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203209/http://www.blaser.de/R93-Characteristics.119.0.html?&L=1\n https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203223/http://www.blaser.de/uploads/media/R93_modularsystem_en_07.pdf\n\nHunting rifles\nStraight-pull rifles\nModular firearms\nRifles of Germany"}

He was also a headmaster in Tromsø, and a politician for the Conservative Party who served as mayor of Tromsø and as Minister of Education and Church Affairs.\n\nPersonal life\nHe was born in Lyngseidet as a son of district physician Engebret Qvigstad (1814–1869) and Petra Krogh Wadel (1828–1905). In August 1885 in Hammerfest he married Margrethe Antonette Aagaard (1859–1949). Their son Just Knut Qvigstad was a notable engineer. He was also a brother-in-law of Arnfinn Palmstrøm.\n\nCareer in education and politics\nHe was homeschooled until the age of ten, when he moved to Tromsø where he took the examen artium in 1869. He enrolled in philology studies at the Royal Frederick University in 1870 and graduated with the cand.philol. degree in 1874. He was a teacher in Christiania from 1874 to 1875 and in Tromsø from 1875 to 1880, from 1878 at Tromsø Seminary. He studied from 1880 to 1881 to take the cand.theol. degree, and was hired as headmaster at Tromsø Seminary in 1883. He remained here to 1920. From 1910 to 1912 he was the Minister of Education and Church Affairs in Konow's Cabinet. As a politician he was also a member of Tromsø city council from 1889 to 1907, serving as mayor in the years 1889, 1905 and 1907.\n\nAcademic career\nQvigstad also made a name for himself as an academic. An interest in Sami language and culture started when he was hired at Tromsø Seminary, and he published his first of 112 academic works in 1881.

D.129) is an illuminated marginal Psalter made in the middle of the 9th Century. It is a unique monument of Byzantine art at the time of the Iconoclasm, one of only three illuminated Byzantine Psalters to survive from the 9th century. \n\nAccording to one tradition, the miniatures are supposed to have been created clandestinely, and many of them are directed against Iconoclasts.  Many contain explanations of the drawings written next to them, and little arrows point out from the main text to the illustration, to show which line the picture refers to.  The polemical style of the whole ensemble is highly unusual, and a demonstration of the furious passions the Iconoclast dispute generated.   \n\nThe psalter measures 195 mm by 150 mm and contains only 169 folios. The outer edges of the pages are normally left blank in order to be covered with illustrations. The text and captions were written in a diminutive uncial script, but many of these were rewritten in crude minuscule about three centuries later.  The book contains the Psalms in the arrangement of the Septuagint, and the responses to be chanted during their recitation, which follow the Liturgy of Hagia Sophia, the Imperial church in Constantinople.\n\nIn the illustration to the right, the miniaturist illustrated the line \"They gave me gall to eat; and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink\" with a picture of a soldier offering Christ vinegar on a sponge attached to a pole. Below is a picture of the last Iconoclast Patriarch of Constantinople, John the Grammarian rubbing out a painting of Christ with a similar sponge attached to a pole. John is caricatured, here as on other pages, with untidy straight hair sticking out in all directions, which was considered ridiculous by the elegant Byzantines.  \n\nNikodim Kondakov hypothesized that the psalter was created in the famous monastery of St John the Studite in Constantinople. Other scholars believe that the liturgical responses it contains were only used in Hagia Sophia, and that it was therefore a product of the Imperial workshops in Constantinople, soon after the return of the Iconophiles to power in 843. \n\nIt was kept at Mount Athos until 1847, when a Russian scholar brought it to Moscow. The psalter was then acquired by Aleksey Khludov, whose name it bears today. It passed as part of the Khludov bequest to the Nikolsky Old Believer Monastery and then to the State Historical Museum.\n\nReferences\n\nRobin Cormack, Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons, 1985, George Philip, London, \nKathleen  Corrigan, Visual Polemics in the Ninth-Century Byzantine Psalters (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1992),\n\nFurther reading\nEvans, Helen C. & Wixom, William D., The glory of Byzantium: art and culture of the Middle Byzantine era, A.D. 843-1261, no. 52, 1997, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, ; full text available online from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries\n\nExternal links \n \n Catalog Entry for MS.

It offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs in nursing and a public health master's degree. It is a subsidiary of Adtalem Global Education, formerly DeVry Education Group. The university is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.\n\nHistory\nThe roots of Chamberlain University are with its predecessor, Deaconess School of Nursing; its related organization, Deaconess Central Hospital; and the Deaconess tradition of service.\n\nThe Deaconess tradition began in 19th-century Europe when Theodor Fliedner of Kaiserswerth, Germany, established the first Deaconess Home and Hospital in 1836. The word deaconess means “one who is devoted to service”, being the feminine gender of the word deacon. The Deaconess Foundation exists today as a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping children in the St. Louis metropolitan area.\n\nDeaconess Central Hospital was first established in St. Louis in 1889 by the Evangelical Deaconess Society of St. Louis, which was part of the Evangelical Synod that later merged with other Protestant denominations to form the United Church of Christ. The hospital was first at 2119 Eugenia Street, then moved to 4117 West Belle Place in 1893, and finally ended at 6150 Oakland Avenue in 1930. The hospital, by then named Forest Park Hospital, was sold to Tenet Healthcare Corp. of Dallas in 1997. In 2004, Forest Park Hospital was purchased by Argilla Healthcare Inc., which merged with Doctors Community Healthcare Corp. of Scottsdale, Arizona, becoming Envision Hospital Corp. It was acquired by Success Healthcare LLC in 2008. Its emergency room was closed in 2011 following many difficult years that included the laying off of the majority of their employees. In 2012, its property was purchased by the nearby St. Louis Zoo as part of a 20-year expansion project.\n\nThe Deaconess School of Nursing was established in 1943.  It was purchased by DeVry (later known as \nAdtalem Global Education, Inc.) and became the Chamberlain College of Nursing in 2005. It was subsequently renamed Chamberlain University. Its headquarters is located in Downers Grove, Illinois.\n\nIn 2017, Chamberlain College of Nursing students in Texas protested a new requirement that they pass a comprehensive test to graduate. This followed the Texas Board of Nursing's decision to forbid Chamberlain from enrolling new students after a significant number of recent graduates were failing the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX).\n\nAcademics\nChamberlain University has two colleges, the College of Nursing and the College of Health Professions. The university is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission with some specific programs accredited by other accrediting bodies. Degree programs include the Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Master of Science in Nursing, Master of Public Health, Master of Social Work, and Doctor of Nursing Practice.\n\nCampuses\n\nAddison, Illinois\nAtlanta, Georgia\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nChicago, Illinois \nColumbus, Ohio\nCleveland, Ohio\nHouston, Texas\nIndianapolis, Indiana \nIrving, Texas \nIrwindale, California\nJacksonville, Florida \nLas Vegas, Nevada\nMiramar, Florida\nNew Orleans, Louisiana \nNorth Brunswick, New Jersey \nPearland, Texas \nPhoenix, Arizona \nSacramento, California \nSan Antonio, Texas \nSt. Louis, Missouri \nTinley Park, Illinois\nTroy, Michigan  \nTysons Corner, Virginia\n\nStudent outcomes\nThe US Department of Education's College Scorecard reports the following regarding Chamberlain-Illinois:\n74 percent graduation rate\nMedian salary after attending of $55,000 to $71,000\nRepayment rate (2 years after entering repayment: 26% Making Progress, 26% Not Making Progress, 21% Forbearance, 15% Deferment, 6% Paid In Full, 3% Delinquent, 3% Defaulted, 0% Discharged\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial website\n\nFor-profit universities and colleges in the United States\nEducational institutions established in 1889\n1889 establishments in Missouri\nAdtalem Global Education\nNursing schools in the United States"}

A Confederate cavalry force led by Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest moved into Tennessee and Kentucky to capture Union supplies. Tennessee had been occupied by Union troops since 1862. He launched a successful raid on Paducah, Kentucky, on the Ohio River.\n\nEvents\n\nIn March 1864, Forrest set out from Columbus, Mississippi, for raiding in West Tennessee and Kentucky, with a force of just under 3,000 men. His object was to recruit soldiers, re-equip his men with supplies, and disrupt Union activities. He reached Paducah on March 25 and quickly occupied the town. The Union garrison of 650 men under Col. Stephen G. Hicks withdrew to Fort Anderson, in the town's west end. The fort was supported by two Union gunboats on the Ohio River, and Hicks began shelling the area with his artillery.\n\nForrest tried to bluff Hicks into surrendering, warning him, \"... if I have to storm your works, you may expect no quarter.\" Knowing the fort could not be easily taken, Hicks rejected the demand.\n\nWith the Union garrison holed up in their fort, Forrest's men began loading any Union Army supplies they could use into wagons and destroyed the rest. They rounded up all the army horses and mules they could find.  A portion of Forrest's men from Kentucky decided to attack Fort Anderson on their own, much to his irritation. This attack constituted the Battle of Paducah. It was repulsed, causing the Confederates heavy and needless casualties. In reporting on the raid, many newspapers stated that Forrest missed more than a hundred fine horses hidden by the Yankees. As a result, Forrest sent Colonel Abraham Buford back to Paducah in mid-April and he captured these horses.\n\nCasualties during the Paducah raid totaled 90 Union soldiers and 50 Confederates, most of them during the attack on the fort. The raid was counted as a victory for the Confederates because they had fewer casualties and gained some supplies, but they achieved little beyond destroying Union supplies and capturing needed cavalry mounts. They did not take the fort or alter control of the region. The raid put the Union Army on notice that Forrest and other Confederates raiders could still strike deep into Union-held territory.\n\nSee also\n List of battles fought in Kentucky\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \"Battle of Paducah\", National Park Service description\n Update to the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission: Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields /Commonwealth of Kentucky'', National Park Service, Washington, DC: October 2008\n\nPaducah\nPaducah\nPaducah\nPaducah\nPaducah\nMcCracken County, Kentucky\n1864 in Kentucky\nPaducah\nMarch 1864 events"}

She wrote four concerti and numerous chamber pieces, as well as over 25 hours of film music. Her compositions were featured on 12 CDs and over 20 LPs; she was featured in TV programs produced in Belgium, France, Germany and Poland.\n\nHer output included several operas which brought to the stage some of the greatest works of European literature (e.g. The Penal Colony, after Franz Kafka, 1972; The Women of Troy after Euripides, 1973; and The Gates of Paradise, after Jerzy Andrzejewski, 1987).\n\nBruzdowicz had a long-standing creative relationship with French film director Agnès Varda, for whom she composed soundtracks for movies from Sans Toit Ni Loi (engl.

His father, a farmer who had served as a private in the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, died before Colin's birth.\n\nGum received his BSc honours degree from the University of Adelaide in 1949, going directly to the Mount Stromlo Observatory, based upon work conducted at which he was awarded his MSc from the University of Adelaide in 1951. He was awarded his PhD in 1955 by the Australian National University, one of the first recipients of this degree from that institution.\n\nCareer\nGum catalogued emission nebulae in the southern sky at the Mount Stromlo Observatory using wide field photography. Gum published his findings in 1955 in a study entitled A study of diffuse southern H-alpha nebulae which presented a catalog, now known as the Gum catalog, of 85 nebulae or nebular complexes. Gum 12, a large area of nebulosity in the direction of the constellations Puppis and Vela, was later named the Gum Nebula in his honour. Gum was part of the team, whose number included Frank John Kerr and Gart Westerhout, that determined the precise position of the neutral hydrogen plane in space.\n\nGum was appointed Head of the Observational Optical Astronomy programme at the University of Sydney in 1959. He died in a skiing accident at Zermatt, Switzerland the following year. He was the brother-in-law of academic Fay Gale.

Elevated in three different tectonic periods, they spread out in the Małopolska Upland, between Pilica and the Vistula. Their outlines are gentle and their heights are small. However, they fascinate with the extremely original structure, varied vegetation and the animal world.\n\nFlora\nThe park is famous for its trees, of which 674 are regarded as monuments of nature and as such are under protection. Park authorities successfully managed to reintroduce yew trees here – now there are around 1300 of them. Most of the park's area is forested, mainly with pines and beeches. Fir trees are less numerous as well as forests of mixed oak-fir character. Among the park's curiosities we must emphasize the endemic, unique only for this area, fir wilderness and areas of Polish larch on Chełmowa Góra.\n\nFauna\nThe park's fauna is represented by more than 4000 species of invertebrates and 210 species of vertebrae (including 187 protected). One of local animal's life most precious features is the fact that many of species are of mountainous kind. These usually thrive in the strictly protected areas and deep in the forests.\n\nArchitecture\nApart from nature, the park and its vicinity has a lot more to offer. There are several important architectural relics, most of which of sacral character. The most precious is the Benedictine Holy Cross Abbey from the first half of the 12th century, located on the peak of Łysa Góra. It is probable that here the oldest example of Polish writing was created – Kazania Świętoktrzyskie (Holy Cross Sermons). An interesting feature of the local landscape is the numerous roadside chapels.\n\nOther fine examples of architecture are situated beyond the park's limits. These are: female monastery at Św. Katarzyna (1633), churches at Bielice (17th century) and Bodzentynów (15th century), ruins of a castle at Bodzentyn (14th century), parts of rampart around Łysa Góra (9th century) and museum of metallurgy at Słupia Nowa, where occasionally ancient method of producing steel is presented to tourists. The park has many historical monuments connected with Polish national uprisings and the time of Nazi occupation.\n\nExternal links\nUniversity site\nOfficial site\n\nNational parks of Poland\nParks in Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship\nProtected areas established in 1950\n1950 establishments in Poland\nCentral European mixed forests"}

He is considered to have been one of the greatest chess players of the 16th century. In 1549, he beat Pope Paul III in a chess match.\n\nEarly life\nHe was born in Syracuse, Sicily (now Italy), and he was brought up for the church under the belief that Paolo would become a pope and a saint, because of a prediction. However, Paolo formed different plans: he started to learn chess, and a few years later he escaped to Greece, then to Saragossa, and finally returned to Sicily as a well-known chess player.\n\nCareer\n\nHe had played several times against Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona in Italy, and the two chess players were considered equal. Then Paolo Boi and Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona defeated the strongest chess player of their time, the famous Spanish player Ruy López de Segura, at the first known international Chess tournament in the court of Philip II of Spain at Madrid, in 1575. As a result, they became the strongest chess players of the era, and henceforth the two were called the \"Light\" and \"Lustre\" of the noble game.\n\nThe chess treatises created by Boi were not preserved. A small number of his chess games have survived to the present time, such as the opening of his game against the chess player Scovara, which gained fame, but only the first fourteen moves have survived.\n\nHe was the first who, without seeing the board, played three games at once, and at the same time conversed with other parties upon different topics. In France, Catherine de Medici, who was also adept at chess, showered favours upon him; and, in Portugal, he had the honour of having the King Don Sebastian for his adversary.\n\nDeath\n\nBoi died in Naples. Historian H. J. R. Murray says he was poisoned by jealous rivals. Other sources say he caught a cold when hunting and died as a result of it. His body was buried in the church of Saint Francisco di Paolo; Prince Stigliano and many of the Neapolitan nobility followed him to the grave.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1528 births\n1598 deaths\nItalian chess players\n16th-century chess players\nPeople from Syracuse, Sicily\nSportspeople from the Province of Syracuse"}

A member of the CDU, he was a member of the Bundestag from 2005 to 2007.\n\nBackground and education\nBorn in Zurich, Switzerland, as Count of Bismarck-Schönhausen, Carl von Bismarck is a member of the princely House of Bismarck and the son of the lawyer and landowner Ferdinand von Bismarck and the Belgian countess Elisabeth Lippens. He is the great-great-grandson of the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck.\n\nAfter receiving his Abitur in 1982, von Bismarck completed his two years of military service at the Bismarck Kasern in Wentorf, West Germany.\n\nIn 1985, von Bismarck concluded his training in capital markets investing at Citibank and worked for Shearson Lehman in New York. In 1988 he received his bachelor's degree in international business from UCLA.\n\nCareer\n\nBusiness\nIn 1989, von Bismarck was requested by his father to return to West Germany. Between 1989 and 1992, he worked for the company Investor Treuhand in Düsseldorf. Since 1993 he worked for the Princely Bismarck Administration (Fürstlich von Bismarck'schen Verwaltung) in Friedrichsruh.\n\nPolitics\nBismarck became a member of the CDU in 1995, and was elected vice-chairman of the CDU in Lauenburg in 1999 (his ancestor, Otto von Bismarck, had been the nominal Duke of Lauenburg in the 1890s). When Peter Harry Carstensen became Prime Minister of Schleswig-Holstein, Bismarck replaced him in the Bundestag, the German parliament. In the 2005 federal election, he won his constituency with a plurality (44.4%) of the vote. Criticism arose, however, because after initial efforts he was only loosely exercising his mandate and rarely appeared in parliament. He resigned his mandate on 19 December 2007. If he had resigned in January, as planned, he would have been eligible for a pension, inciting more criticism.\n\nPersonal life\nVon Bismarck was previously married to Mexican-American actress Laura Harring (1987–1989), Swiss heiress and humanitarian Celia Demaurex (1997–2004), and Canadian designer Nathalie Bariman (2004–2014). He then married Italo-Brazilian art writer and curator Alessandra Silvestri-Levy in 2016.\n\nVon Bismarck has two children with Nathalie Bariman, i.e. a son and heir apparent to the princely title, Count Alexei von Bismarck-Schönhausen, and a daughter, Countess Grace von Bismarck-Schönhausen. Bariman is Jewish, and they married in a Jewish ceremony. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is reported to have told the couple, \"You two have united history... the next Prince of Bismarck will be a mix of both religions.\"\n\nSee also \n Gottfried von Bismarck (brother)\n Mona von Bismarck\n House of Bismarck\n\nReferences \n\nMembers of the Bundestag for Schleswig-Holstein\nCarl-Eduard\nLiving people\nMembers of the Bundestag 2005–2009\nMembers of the Bundestag 2002–2005\nMembers of the Bundestag for the Christian Democratic Union of Germany\nGerman people of Belgian descent\nGerman people of Swedish descent\nGerman people of English descent\nGerman people of Hungarian descent\nPrinces of Bismarck\nYear of birth missing (living people)"}
{"id": "4107506", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%20Secretary%20of%20State", "title": "Illinois Secretary of State", "text": "The Secretary of State of Illinois is one of the six elected executive state offices of the government of Illinois, and one of the 47 secretaries of state in the United States.  The Illinois Secretary of State keeps the state records, laws, library, and archives, and is the state's corporation registration, vehicle registration and driver licensing authority.  The current Secretary of State is Alexi Giannoulias, a Democrat who took office in 2023.\n\nDuties\nThe Secretary of State, in accordance with the state constitution, is keeper of the official acts of the General Assembly, the official records of the executive branch, and the Great Seal of Illinois. These duties have remained unchanged since Illinois became a U.S. state in 1818. The office also registers corporations and lobbyists, commissions notaries public, and regulates the securities industry, among connected responsibilities.\n\nThe Secretary of State performs other duties prescribed by law. For instance, the Secretary oversees the state archives and the state library. The State Archives serves as the official depository of state agency and local government records that possess administrative, legal, or historic research value. The State Library houses more than 5,000,000 items, and other informational resources, and oversees a consortium of academic and regional libraries in the state. In addition, the Secretary is the custodian of the Illinois State Capitol and all state buildings.\n\nBy statute, the Illinois Secretary of State is also tasked with issuing licenses to Illinois drivers and registering motor vehicles operated in the state, effectively making the Secretary of State's office the department of motor vehicles, though that phrase is not used in Illinois. Enforcement of these duties has made the Secretary of State's office a key bureau in the enforcement of laws against driving under the influence. Illinois is one of only three states to put the secretary of state in charge of driver services, the other two being Maine and Michigan.\n\nThe Secretary of State is third (behind the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, respectively) in the line of succession to the office of Governor of Illinois.\n\nPolice\n\nSecretary of State Police\nThe Secretary of State Police of Illinois is a statewide police force, established in 1913; it is responsible for enforcing the laws of the Illinois Vehicle Code such as regulating businesses involved with the sale of motor vehicles and vehicle parts. Its main purpose is to protect consumers against fraud through adherence to state statutes.\n\nThe Secretary of State Police also investigates identity theft, maintains statewide vehicle inspection stations, investigates statewide vehicle thefts, provides statewide school bus regulation, enforces traffic and parking violations and provides law enforcement to all Secretary of State facilities.\n\nIllinois State Capitol Police\nThe Secretary of State Police also maintains the Illinois State Capitol Police, responsible for policing the Illinois State Capitol Complex in Springfield, including both the Capitol and 16 surrounding state buildings. The force was created following a 2004 incident in which an unarmed security guard was shot and killed. The force has an authorised strength of 60 officers.\n\nFacilities\nThe Secretary of State's office occupies three buildings of the Illinois State Capitol Complex in Springfield. Many of the Secretary of State's workers assigned to motor vehicle and licensing duties work in the Howlett Building, south of the Capitol. The Howlett Building is named after former Secretary of State Michael Howlett. The State Archives are housed in the Norton Building, southwest of the Capitol. The Illinois State Library is located in the Brooks Library, east of the Capitol, which is named for longtime state Poet Laureate Gwendolyn Brooks, winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1950.\n\nIn addition, the Secretary of State operates 136 Driver Services license-issuing facilities statewide and maintains its own police force.  Established in 1913, their duties include enforcement of the Illinois Vehicle Code on businesses regulated by the Secretary of State and maintaining public safety, traffic control and assisting other law enforcement agencies.\n\nOfficeholders\nThe Secretary of State, to be eligible to take the oath of office, must be a United States citizen of at least 25 years of age, and a resident of Illinois for at least three years preceding the election.\n\nOn January 9, 2023, Jesse White, a Democrat, completed his sixth term as the 37th Secretary of State, the first African-American in the position and by far longest-serving Secretary in Illinois history. Before being elected Secretary of State in November 1998, White had been an elected office-holder from Chicago since 1974. White, who decided to retire at the end of his sixth term at the age of 88, was succeeded by Alexi Giannoulias, who won the 2022 election and became the 38th Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary of State before White was George Ryan, a Republican from Kankakee, Illinois.  He held the office from 1991 to 1999, when he became Governor of Illinois.  Ryan's tenure as Secretary of State led to his downfall in the \"licenses for bribes\" scandal: after a major automobile accident in Wisconsin that killed six children, investigators discovered that unqualified truck drivers were receiving drivers licenses in exchange for bribes.  Ryan chose not to run for re-election in 2002, and in 2006, he was convicted of fraud, including using his authority as Secretary of State to end his office's internal investigation after it discovered the scheme.\n\nThis is a list of all the people who have served as Illinois Territorial Secretary and people who have served as Illinois Secretary of State.\n\nSeal of Illinois\n\nThe official motto of the state of Illinois is \"State Sovereignty - National Union\". The Illinois Secretary of State in 1867, Sharon Tyndale, as the keeper of the Great Seal of Illinois, had it re-engraved so that the word \"sovereignty\" was upside down. This 1867 seal redesign continues in use to this day, and can be seen, among other places, as the principal device on the flag of Illinois.\n\nSee also\n Governor of Illinois\n Lieutenant Governor of Illinois\n Illinois Attorney General\n Comptroller of Illinois\n Treasurer of Illinois\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMotor vehicle registration agencies\n \nState\n1818 establishments in Illinois"}

Hard to distinguish, it was widely believed to be the greatly expanded (and still expanding) remains of a supernova that took place about a million years ago. More recent research suggests it may be an evolved H II region. It contains the 11,000-year-old Vela Supernova Remnant, along with the Vela Pulsar.\n\nThe Gum Nebula contains about 32 cometary globules. These dense cloud cores are subject to such strong radiation from O-type stars γ2 Vel and ζ Pup and formerly the progenitor of the Vela Supernova Remnant that the cloud cores evaporate away from the hot stars into comet-like shapes. Like ordinary Bok globules, cometary globules are believed to be associated with star formation.\n\nIt is named after its discoverer, the Australian astronomer Colin Stanley Gum (1924–1960).

The Union army was led by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and the Confederate army by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston.  Confederates were forced to evacuate their strong position due to a Union flanking movement.\n\nBattle\nGeneral Johnston had entrenched his army on the long, steep Rocky Face Ridge and eastward across Crow Valley. When Sherman approached, he demonstrated against this position with two columns while he sent a third one through Snake Creek Gap, to the south, to hit the Western & Atlantic Railroad at Resaca. The first two columns engaged the enemy at Buzzard Roost (Mill Creek Gap) and at Dug Gap while the third column, under Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson, passed through Snake Creek Gap and on May 9 advanced to the outskirts of Resaca, where it found Confederates entrenched. Fearing the strength of the enemy, McPherson pulled his column back to Snake Creek Gap. On May 10, Sherman decided to join McPherson in an effort to take Resaca. The next morning, Sherman's army withdrew from in front of Rocky Face Ridge. Discovering Sherman's movement, Johnston retired south towards Resaca on May 12.\n\nBattlefield\nIn 2016, the American Battlefield Trust and its partners acquired, for purposes of preservation, 301 acres of the Rocky Face Ridge Battlefield, including surviving earthworks and the remains of a continuous entrenchment more than 2,000 feet long.

He moved as a child to Worthing, Sussex, and then to Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, where he started learning guitar while at Ross Grammar School. His middle name, Overend (which initially he did not use), came from that of a family ancestor.\n\nCareer\nWatts began playing the guitar at the age of 13 and by 1965, he had switched to bass guitar, and became a professional musician alongside Mick Ralphs in a group, the Buddies, that played in German clubs. The group later became the Doc Thomas Group, and then Shakedown Sound, before finally changing their name to Silence and settling in London in 1969. The group then added singer Ian Hunter, became Mott the Hoople, and, taking the advice of manager Guy Stevens, Pete Watts adopted the stage name Overend Watts.\nFollowing the departure of Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson from the band, in 1974, the remaining members of Mott the Hoople recruited relative unknowns Ray Major, on guitar, and Nigel Benjamin, on vocals. The name was abbreviated to Mott and a further two albums, Drive On (1975) and Shouting and Pointing (1976), were recorded with this line-up, before Benjamin quit.\n\nWatts continued, with Dale \"Buffin\" Griffin, Morgan Fisher and Ray Major, in the Mott successor British Lions, recruiting former Medicine Head member John Fiddler. They released the albums British Lions, which reached No. 83 in the US (1977), and Trouble with Women (1982). He later became a record producer, producing albums for artists including Hanoi Rocks and Dumb Blondes.\n\nWatts's bass of choice was a white Gibson Thunderbird, one of which was later sold to Wishbone Ash bassist Martin Turner.\n\nLater career\nIn January 2009 it was confirmed that Watts and the other original members of Mott the Hoople would reform for three 40th anniversary reunion concerts in October 2009. The reunion at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo, London, England was extended to five shows due to popular demand.\n\nIn August 2009 American rock music group Mambo Sons released their double album Heavy Days featuring a song in tribute to him entitled \"Overend Watts\".\n\nIn November 2013 Mott the Hoople again reunited, with Martin Chambers once again sitting in (for an ailing Buffin) on drums, for a series of UK gigs in Birmingham, Glasgow, Newcastle and Manchester, before concluding at the o2 in London.\n\nBefore his death in 2017 Watts finally completed his solo album that he had been promising to deliver to his legion of fans for the past decade plus. In keeping with his legendary witty humour, he decreed that as the album would be released after his passing it would not be called \"She’s Real Gone\" as planned but changed to \"He’s Real Gone\".\n\nDeath\nWatts died on 22 January 2017 from throat cancer at the age of 69.\n\nPublication\nWatts was known for his long-distance walks.

He was apprenticed at age 13 to the book and stationery store of Andrea and Company in nearby Ruhrort from November 1860 until June 1862. His mother died on April 2, 1862. The Kuhrs family moved to Dortmund, Westphalia. In July 1862, Adolph was apprenticed for a three-year period at Kronen, a brewery owned by Heinrich Wenker in Dortmund. He was charged a fee for his apprenticeship, so he worked as a bookkeeper to pay for it. His father died on November 24, 1862. Orphaned, Adolph completed his apprenticeship and continued to work as a paid employee at the Wenker Brewery until May 1867. He then worked at breweries in Kassel, Berlin, and Uelzen in Germany.\n\nEarly in 1868, he came to the United States as an undocumented stowaway.  He remained ashamed of that action for the rest of his life, and decreed that his family should never speak about it. The family never openly discussed the fact that the family patriarch had been a stowaway until his son's death in 1970. He sailed from Hamburg to New York City and then moved to Chicago, arriving on May 30, 1868. His name was changed from \"Kuhrs\" to \"Coors\". He worked in the spring as a laborer, and during the summer he worked as a brewer. In the fall and winter, he worked as a fireman, loading coal into the firebox of a steam engine. In the spring and summer of 1869, he worked as an apprentice bricklayer and a stone cutter. He became foreman of John Stenger's brewery on August 11, 1869, in Naperville, Illinois, about 35 miles west of Chicago.\n\nHe resigned from Stenger's brewery on January 22, 1872, and moved to Denver, arriving in April. He worked in Denver as a gardener for a month, and on May 1, 1872, he purchased a partnership in the bottling firm of John Staderman. In the same year, he bought and assumed control of the entire business.\n\nGolden Brewery\nOn November 14, 1873, Coors and the Denver confectioner Jacob Schueler purchased the abandoned Golden City Tannery and converted it to the Golden Brewery. By February 1874, they were producing beer for sale. In 1880, Coors purchased Schueler's interest, and the brewery was renamed Adolph Coors Golden Brewery. When Prohibition began in Colorado in 1916, he converted his brewery to make malted milk. The company also manufactured porcelain and ceramic products made from clay mined in Golden. The Coors Porcelain division has since split off and is now known as CoorsTek.\n\nMarriage and family\n\nImmediate family\nOn April 12, 1879, Adolph Coors married Louisa Webber, the daughter of the superintendent of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad maintenance shops.  They were married at the Coors home on the brewery grounds.  Adolph and Louisa raised three sons and three daughters to adulthood, with two children dying in infancy.  Louise was born on March 2, 1880, and was nicknamed Lulu among her many friends.  Their second child was Augusta, born in 1881, and known by her nickname of Gussie.  The fifth born and third surviving child was Adolph Coors Jr., on January 12, 1884.  Bertha Coors was born on June 24, 1886, and Grover C. Coors was born in 1888.  The last addition to the family, Herman Frederick Coors, was born on July 24, 1890, while the family was on vacation in Berlin.\n\nAll of the daughters attended the Wolcott School for Girls in Denver.  Louise married Henry F. Kugeler at the Coors Mansion, and Augusta married Herbert E. Collbran there on October 5, 1905.  At the time, Transcript editor George West wrote, \"Miss Coors is a native Golden girl and proud of it.  She is pretty and talented, and by her universally pleasant and courteous demeanor has endeared herself to all the people of her native town.\"  Her husband and she moved to Korea, where his father was the nation's transportation adviser. Herbert Collbran held an important position with the government railways. The international shipping of Coors beer, beginning in Korea in 1908, possibly was related to the family's presence there.\n\nAdolph Jr., Grover, and Herman all graduated from Cornell University, and returned to Denver to take positions in the family operations.  Adolph Jr. was married to Alice May Kistler at the Kistler home, and the family lived in Denver.  Grover married Gertrude at the Coors Mansion.  Bertha, who became an accomplished equestrienne and safari hunter, married Harold S. Munroe on January 8, 1911, at the Coors Mansion.  They moved to Mexico, where Harold worked in gold-mining operations.  Grover Coors married Doreathea Clara Morse on May 25, 1916, in Tompkins, New York. Herman Coors married Janet Ferrin and remained in Golden, working in the family porcelain factory.  In 1926, he moved to Inglewood, California, where he established the H.F. Coors China Company.\n\nSiblings\nAdolph Coors is known to have had at least two siblings, a sister and a younger brother, William Kuhrs, who was born in Dortmund, Germany, in 1849.  William followed his brother to America in 1870 and took the same respelling of the family name.  He made his way to Chicago, where he made a good living as a cabinetmaker and arrived in Golden by the mid-1870s.  He took a good position of employment at his brother's brewery, where he remained employed for the rest of his life.  Following further in his brother's footsteps, William married Louisa's sister Mary in 1881, and 10 years later moved to Denver, where he had charge of the Coors interests in that city.  The couple had three daughters, two of whom were Mattie and Helena.  William Coors died on December 30, 1923, and is buried at the Golden Cemetery.  Upon his death, the Colorado Transcript described him as \"a genial, accommodating man, and had many friends in Golden, Denver, and elsewhere.\"  His oldest daughter married William J. Gilbert and the second married Charles Nitschke.\n\nDeath\nOn June 5, 1929, Adolph Coors fell or allegedly committed suicide by leaping from the sixth-floor window of the Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\n\nSee also\n\n Eberhard Anheuser\n Jacob Best\n Valentin Blatz\n Adolphus Busch\n August Anheuser Busch Sr.\n Adolph Coors III\n Pete Coors\n Gottlieb Heileman\n Frederick Miller\n Frederick Pabst\n Joseph Schlitz\n August Uihlein\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Banham, Russ.

It was abolished at the January 2015 NUTS 3 revision. It was a subregion of the Centro Region, centered on the historical city of Coimbra. With an area of 2,062 km² and a population of 336,376 inhabitants (of which half are in the cities of Coimbra and Figueira da Foz), the Baixo Mondego was a subregion with a mean density of 163/km². The subregion was named after the Mondego River and all this river area has been known as Baixo Mondego (Lower Mondego) since ancient times, even before the creation of the NUTS3.\n\nEconomy\nEconomically, the subregion is dominated by the presence of the city of Coimbra, that plays the role of capital and chief city of Portugal's Centro Region. Coimbra has a notable university, major hospitals, wide range of services, important technological-based companies, and diverse cultural attractions. There is also a strong industrial presence around the port city of Figueira da Foz that comprises a busy seaport, fishing harbour and summer tourism facilities. Along the shores of the Mondego River, there is important agriculture activity. The city of Cantanhede is the heart of an important wine region and an agriculture centre, and is a modern bioscience hub through the Biocantpark, a science park. The subregion is place for important forestry, fishing and livestock raising activities, and produces sizeable quantities of rice, corn, wine, olive oil, fruits and vegetables. Biosciences, engineering, pulp and paper, ceramics, information technologies and food, are the main industries.\n\nMunicipalities\nThe subregion comprises eight municipalities (municípios):\n\nCantanhede\nCoimbra\nCondeixa-a-Nova\nFigueira da Foz  \nMealhada municipality\nMira\nMontemor-o-Velho\nPenacova\nSoure\n\nThe largest cities are Coimbra (106,000), Figueira da Foz (28,000), Cantanhede (9,000) and Mealhada (5,000).\n\nReferences\n\nFormer NUTS 3 statistical regions of Portugal"}
{"id": "4107544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin%20Chinese%20profanity", "title": "Mandarin Chinese profanity", "text": "Profanity in Mandarin Chinese most commonly involves sexual references and scorn of the object's ancestors, especially their mother. Other Mandarin insults accuse people of not being human. Compared to English, scatological and blasphemous references are less often used. In this article, unless otherwise noted, the traditional character will follow its simplified form if it is different.\n\nSex\n\nPenis\nAs in English, many Mandarin Chinese slang terms involve the genitalia or other sexual terms. Slang words for the penis refer to it literally, and are not necessarily negative words:\n\n  (, IM abbreviation: J8/G8) = cock (used as early as the Yuan Dynasty), also written 𣬠𣬶\n  (, IM: JJ/GG) = roughly equivalent of \"thingy\" as it is the childish version of the above.\n  (), baby talk, \"tool\".\n  () = roughly equivalent of \"wee-wee\" (lit. \"little younger brother\") IM: DD\n  () = roughly equivalent of \"the package\" (lit. \"thing under crotch\")\n  ()= penis (scientific)\n  ( or substituted by ) = dick (the same character also means to have sexual intercourse in Cantonese, alternatively written as )\n  () same as \"\", used in some southern areas such as Fujian and Guangdong.  Also written as \"\" in Cantonese.  It was misinterpreted as  () by Mandarin speakers, though sometimes \"\" is used instead for euphemism.\n  () = penis (lit. \"second in the family\", \"little brother\")\n  () = penis, usually seen in novels/fictions. (lit. \"That thing\", \"that matter\")\n  () = used by people (mostly children) in Taiwan, Malaysia, and Singapore to mean penis (lit. \"little bird\"), often simplified to  ()\n  () = turtle's head (glans/penis)\n  () = foreskin (literally: wrapper)\n  () = originally meant male pubic hair, but means an unprivileged nobody. Formerly Internet slang, now a popular word often used in self-mockery (lit. \"dick silk/wire\")\n\nNote: One should note that in Middle Chinese the words for  and  were homophones. The fǎnqiè of \"\" () and the  of \"\" () denoted the same pronunciation; both began with a voiceless unaspirated alveolar stop (/t/ in IPA and d in pinyin) and the same vowel and tone.  Based on regular sound change rules, we would expect the word for bird in Mandarin to be pronounced , but Mandarin dialects' pronunciations of the word for bird evolved to an alveolar nasal initial, likely as a means of taboo avoidance, giving contemporary  while most dialects in the south retain the Middle Chinese alveolar stop initial and the homophony or near homophony of these words.\n\nVagina\nThere appear to be more words for vagina than for penis. The former are more commonly used as insults and are also more aggressive and have negative connotations:\n\n  (, IM: B) = cunt (often used as an interjection instead of a noun)\n  () = cunt (Taiwanese Mandarin, near-homophone of Hokkien profanity chi-bai)\n  () = pussy (lit. \"little younger sister\", see. xiaodidi above)\n  () = pussy (lit. \"abalone\" due to its flesh having a superficial resemblance to a vulva)\n  (, IM: 2B) = idiot (Northern slang, lit. \"two + cunt\"; here, 二 does not mean the number two, but is rather an idiomatic adjective meaning \"stupid\"; some argue that this expression evolved from 二百五 (èr bǎi wǔ; see \"miscellaneous\" section below). 屄 is used as an interjection. This expression cannot be literally interpreted as \"double-vagina\")\n  () = stupid person (lit. \"stupid cunt\") IM: SB\n  () = bitch (lit. \"lewd cunt\")\n  () = stinking cunt\n  () = rotten cunt\n  () = vagina (scientific)\n  () = vulva (scientific)\n  () = vagina (lit. \"garden of peach blossoms\")\n  () = poser (lit. \"pretending to be the cunt\")\n  () = menstruation (Literally \"The Eldest Aunt\", almost never used derogatively; a popular mainland contemporary term which refers to menstruation. Comparable to 'A visit from Aunt Flo')\n\nBrothel frequenter\n  () literally, lewd worms. Men who enjoy frequent sex with women.\n  () literally, old frequenter of prostitutes.  There is actually a verb for frequenting prostitutes in Chinese.\n\nProstitution\nIn addition to the above expressions used as insults directed against women, other insults involve insinuating that they are prostitutes:\n\n  () = (female) prostitute\n  () = stinking whore\n  (; literally \"selling tofu\") is a euphemism for prostitution.\n  () = means \"Miss\" or \"Small elder sister\" in most contexts but, now in Northern China, also connotes \"prostitute\" to many young women, as it suggests expressions like  () or  (), which refers to bargirls who may also be prostitutes.  This connotation does not apply outside of the People's Republic of China.\n  (; lit. \"chick\") = (female) prostitute\n  (; lit. \"duck\") = (male) prostitute\n\nMistress\n  () = mistress (lit. \"little wife\" or \"little old women\"). Note: when combined with other words, the character  () does not always refer to age; for example, it is used in the terms  (),  (),  (),  (),  (), including for important persons such as  () or  (). \" () thus often carries with it a degree of familiarity.\n  (), lit., \"little wife\" (but definitely not to be mistaken for \"the little woman\", which can be a way of referring to a wife in English).\n  (), lit., \"the second mistress\" (means a concubine, a kept woman).\n  (), lit., \"little three\" (means a mistress, since she is supposed to be the third person in a relationship).\n\nBreasts\n  (; literally cat's purring \"meow meow\") is a euphemism for breast.\n  (; literally \"big tofu\") slang for large breasts, more prevalent in Guangdong\n  (; literally \"steamed bun\") also refers to a woman's breasts; as mantou is typical of northern Chinese cuisine this term is used primarily in northern China.\n  (, literally \"wave\" or \"undulating\", but sometimes suggested to be derived from \"ball\" which has a similar pronunciation) = boobs. The typical instance is  (), which refers to a woman with very large breasts.\n  (); lit. \"happy long life\"\n  () = boobies.\n  () = motorboating (lit. \"facial cleanser\", where \"\" serves as both slang for breasts and a thick liquid, and pressing one's head between a woman's breasts vaguely resembles washing one's face)\n  () (Beijing slang)\n  () = big tits, likely reborrowing from Japanese.\n  (; literally \"airport\") = flat breasts\n  () – literally \"aircraft carrier\", referring to a flat chest. Compare with  (), meaning battleship, which refers to larger-sized \"chimneys\" of the chest.\n  () means Princess of Peace; this was the actual title of a real princess. However  means great or extreme and  means flat or level. Hence, this phrase is a double entendre, i.e., \"Extremely Flat-Chested Princess.\"\n\nAnus\n\n  (); literally \"chrysanthemums\") – anus. This term comes from the observation that the shape of an anal opening resembles a chrysanthemum flower, where the skin folds are comparable to the flower's small, thin petals. Although nowadays this usage is a commonplace amongst Chinese netizens, the euphemism as such has existed in Chinese literature from much earlier.\n  () – anal orifice, asshole\n  () – anus (medical term), literally \"door of anus\".\n  () – anus. literally \"back yard\".\n\nMasturbation\nMale masturbation, at least, has several vulgar expressions, in addition to two formal/scientific ones that refer to both male and female masturbation (  and  ):\n\n  () = male masturbation (lit. \"firing a handgun\")\n  () = male masturbation (lit. \"hitting an airplane\"). A term which originated from the Cantonese language.\n  () = male masturbation (lit. \"stroke the pipe\")\n  () = male masturbation, also \"stroking the pipe\"\n  () = male masturbation (lit., \"play with little brother\")\n  () = male masturbation (lit. \"five beating one\")\n  () = male masturbation (lit. \"to visit five girls\", a reference to the fact that a human hand has five fingers)\n  () = masturbation (lit. private pleasure / enjoy yourself)\n  () = fingering\n  () = dildo (lit. fake penis)\n  () = vibrator (lit. massage stick)\n\nForeplay\n  () = oral intercourse (scientific); informally euphemized in text as \"\" ( due to its visual resemblance)\n  () = blowjob (lit. \"blow service\")\n  () = blowjob (\"play flute\")\n  () = Taiwanese slang for blowjob\n  () = deep throating\n  () = mouth fucking (a form of blowjob)\n  () = face fucking\n  () = teabagging\n  () = cunnilingus (scientific)\n  () = muff diving (lit. \"licking vagina\")\n  () = muff diving (lit. \"evaluating jade\")\n  () = eat pussy (borrowed from English)\n  () = facesitting\n  () = anilingus (scientific)\n  () = anilingus (lit. \"drilling for poisonous dragons\")\n\nSexual intercourse\n\n  () = to fuck (the first shown Chinese character is made up of components meaning \"to enter\" and \"the flesh\"; the second is the etymological graph, with the standard meaning being \"to do exercise\")\n  () = to do = to fuck, originally from Hokkien .\n  () = to do = to fuck (used in a similar fashion as 幹). This verb (as in \"to do\") originated from Cantonese, but is now widely used in Mandarin (especially PRC) both in its original meaning and to denote sexual intercourse.\n  () (lit. \"to enter)\" = to fuck. The meaning is obvious and in normal contexts  is pronounced .  But when it is used as a coarse expression, the \"u\" is elided. See , vol. 3, p. 3257. It is also commonly seen on internet websites and forums as  , due to similar pronunciation and ease of input.\n  () = anal sex. (lit. burst the chrysanthemum (anus)), i.e., insert the penis into the anus\n  () = to ejaculate (lit. to fire the cannon)\n  () = Sexual orgasm (lit. high tide, also used to describe a climax point in other domains)\n  (）= to have sex (lit. to insert, to penetrate)\n  () = to have sex (lit. \"making stir-fried rice\")\n  () = to have sex (onomatopoeia for grunting noises made when exerting effort, heave-ho)\n  () = to have sex (lit. \"a round of a fight\", but usually made into number of rounds if having sex multiple times, such as \"\" or \"round 3 of fighting\" to mean \"3rd time having sex\")\n  () = rape\n  () = sodomy\n  () = to ejaculate (scientific)\n  () = female ejaculation; squirt (lit. \"orgasm blow\")\n  () = intermammary sex; tit-fuck (lit. \"breast intercourse\")\n  () = ejaculating on a woman's chest after intramammary sex; pearl necklace\n  () = moaning in bed\n\nInsults\nAs in English, a vulgar word for the sexual act is used in insults and expletives:\n\n cào () = fuck (the variant character  was in use as early as the Ming dynasty in the novel Jin Ping Mei). 操 is often used as a substitute for 肏 in print or on the computer, because 肏 was until recently often not available for typesetting or input.\n cào nǐ zǔzōng shíbā dài () = \"Fuck your ancestors to the eighteenth generation\"; the cào 肏, in modern Standard Chinese, is often substituted with 肏; the cào 肏 (fuck) has been substituted for 抄, which meant \"confiscate all the property of someone and of his entire extended family.\" In China, ancestor worship is an important aspect of society, as a result of Confucianism, where filial piety and respect for one's ancestors is considered crucial; insulting one's ancestors is a sensitive issue and is generally confronting.\n\nMother\nInsulting someone's mother is also common:\n tā māde (, IM: TMD) Literally \"[fuck] his mother's\" but frequently used as \"Shit!\" (lit. \"his mother's\"; in the 1920s the famous writer Lu Xun joked that this should be China's national curse word)\n tā mā bāzi ( his mother's clitoris. Lu Xun differentiates this expression from the previous one. This one can be said in admiration, whereas \"tā māde\" is just abusive. See his essay, \"On 'His mother's'\" (論他媽的).\n tā māde niǎo () = goddamn it (lit. \"his mother's dick\";  literally is \"bird\", but used here as a euphemism for diǎo; ; \"penis\")\n qù nǐ nǎinaide () = your mother (lit. \"go to your grandma\")\n qù nǐ māde () = your mother (lit. \"go to your mom\")\n qù nǐde () = fuck you, screw off, shut up (used jokingly and is considered mild and not insulting)\n nǐ māde bī () = your mother's cunt\n cào nǐ mā (, IM: CNM) / cào nǐ niáng () = fuck your mother\n cào nǐ māde bī () = fuck your mother's cunt\n gàn nǐ mā () / gàn nǐ lǎo mǔ () = fuck your mother (gàn is similar to the English euphemism do)\n gàn nǐ niáng () = fuck your mother (Taiwanese Mandarin influenced by the regional vernacular Taiwanese Minnan 姦汝娘 (kàn-lín-nió); also \"幹您娘\")\n\nOther relatives\n nǐ èr dàyé de () = damn on your second uncle. This is a part of local Beijing slang.\n lǎolao () = grandmother-from-mother-side. In Beijing dialect, this word is used for \"Never!\".\n tā nǎinai de () = His grandmother-from-father-side!\n\nTurtles and eggs\nThe 中文大辭典 Zhōng wén dà cí diǎn (Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Chinese Language)), discusses 王八 (wáng bā) in vol. 6 p. 281. \"Wáng bā\" is the term that is usually written casually for the slur that means something like \"son of a bitch.\"\n\nA \"wángbādàn 忘/王八蛋\" is the offspring of a woman lacking virtue. Another meaning of 王八 is 鼈 biē, fresh-water turtle. Turtle heads reemerging from hiding in the turtle's shell look like the glans emerging from the foreskin, and turtles lay eggs. So a \"wang ba\" is a woman who has lost her virtue, and a \"wang ba dan\" is the progeny of such a woman, a turtle product, but, figuratively, also a penis product. 龜頭 (guītóu, \"turtle head\") can refer to the glans of the penis.\n\n\"Wáng bā 王八\" originally got switched over from another \"忘八 wàng bā\" (one that referred to any very unvirtuous individual) because of a man with the family name Wáng 王 who picked up the nickname 賊王八 zéi Wáng bā (\"the thieving Wang Eight\") but for being a dastard, not for being a bastard. The dictionary does not say, but he may have been the eighth Wang among his siblings. Anyway, he became \"crook Wang eight\" and the term stuck and spread just as \"Maverick\" did in English. There is a pun here because of the earlier expression 忘八 wàng bā used to describe (1) any person who forgets/disregards the eight virtues, (2) an un-virtuous woman, i.e., one who sleeps around. The first meaning applied to the dastardly Wang, but the family name got \"stuck\" to the second, sexual, term.\n\nIllegitimacy\nMany insults imply that the interlocutor's mother or even grandmother was promiscuous. The turtle is emblematic of the penis and also of promiscuous intercourse, because turtles were once thought to conceive by thought alone, making paternity impossible to prove. Eggs are the progeny of turtles and other lower animals, so the word dàn (蛋) is a metonym for offspring.\n\n wángbā () / wàngbā () = softshell turtle; this was an insult as early as the Song Dynasty.\n wángbādàn (, informal simplified: ) = bastard (lit. \"softshell turtle egg\")\n wàngbāgāozi () = bastard (lit. \"soft shell turtle's lamb\"; 羔 generally means newborn lamb but can also refer to the young of certain animals - especially mammals - in general. Generally used in Northern slang.)\n guī sūnzi () / guī érzi () = bastard (lit. \"turtle grandson\" and \"turtle son\")\n dài lǜmàozi () = to be a cuckold (lit. \"wear a green hat,\" supposedly because male brothel workers in the Tang Dynasty had to wear green hats)\n zázhǒng () = mixed seed, half-caste, half breed, hybrid, illegitimate child.  There are proper terms for children of mixed ethnicity, but this is not one of them.\n hún dàn () = individual who has at least two biological fathers and one biological mother, the idea being that the mother mated with two or more males in quick succession and a mosaic embryo was formed.\n hún zhang wángbā dàn () = similar to turtle egg, see above.\n\nSuck up\n chóngyáng mèiwài () Chinese who blindly worship foreigners; xenophiles.\n fànjiàn () asking to be disrespected.\n zhāo biǎn () asking to be kicked.\n dīsānxiàsì () servile lickspittle (lit. \"low three down four\").\n gǒutuǐzi () an accomplice to a villain (lit. a dog's leg).\n pāi mǎ pì () to suck up, to be a toady (lit. patting a horse's butt).\n\nDisability\nReferences to various kinds of disability are sometimes used against both abled and disabled people as an insult. \n shén jīng bìng () Lunatic/madman. Literally \"neuropathy\", or having problems with one's nervous system. The word 神經病 uesd in this context properly refers to 精神病 (jīng shén bìng, literally [person with] psychiatric disorder or schizophrenia); 神經病 is an anastrophe of the latter. There are many hypotheses for the reason why people rarely use 精神病 offensively; the most widely accepted interpretation of this idiomatic expression is that in China, imbalance of the nervous system has been historically associated with mental illness. In the 20th century, 神经衰弱 Shenjing shuairuo, literally \"neurasthenia\", is a more socially accepted medical diagnosis for someone who, in the West, would have normally been diagnosed with schizophrenia, due to the social stigma against mental illness in China). Simultaneously, tonal differences make 神經病 sound harsher than 精神病. Now the word is used quite generally when insulting someone whose actions seem insane, odd, rude, offensive, or inappropriate.\n fāfēng () going insane.\n biàntài () Perverted, deviant, abnormal. \n nǎocán () lit. brain crippled. Intelligence or mental capacity. \n bái chī () idiot, someone with mental retardation.\n bái mù () stupid. Literally, white-eyed, blind. Here it means not understanding the situation and reacting in a wrong way as a result.\n bèn dàn () Idiot (lit. stupid egg).\n chǔn dàn  () Stupid (lit. stupid egg).\n chǔn zhū () Stupid (lit. dumb pig).\n chǔn lǘ  () Dumbass\n dà nǎo jìn shuǐ () water leaked in the brain, a possible reference to hydrocephalus.\n shǎ zi  () Blockhead\n zìbì () autistic. Neutral term for people who are actually autistic, but also used as an mildly offensive term for socially awkward people. \n xǐhān () The term is coined by a Taiwanese NGO as a positive term for mentally disabled people, but has become a negative term when used on a neurotypical person. \n zhìzhàng() short for , intellectually disabled. \n cánfèi () crippled. \n bǒzi () crippled. \n  quézi () crippled. \n xiāzi () blind. The word is used either as an obsolete and politically incorrect term for visually impaired people, or as an insult when an abled person fails to see something.  \n lóngzi () deaf. Similar to the above but for hearing instead of vision.\n\nButtocks\nWhile there are vulgar expressions in English referring to the buttocks or rectum, there are no real equivalents in Mandarin. Pìgu yǎn () or pìyǎnr (屁眼兒) one expression for anus, is not vulgar, but it occurs in various curses involving an imperforate anus\n sǐ pì yǎn () damned asshole.\n jiào nǐ shēng háizi méi pìgu yǎn () – literally, \"May your child be born with an imperforate anus\"; sometimes méi pìgu yǎn () is used as an epithet similar to \"damned\". This phrase is commonly heard in some TVB dramas in the Cantonese translation.\n jiào nǐ shēng háizi zhǎng zhì chuāng (叫你生孩子长痔疮) – \"May your child be born with hemorrhoids\"\n wǒ kào ( or – \"Well fuck me!\", \"Fuck!\", \"Fuckin' awesome!\" or \"Holy shit!\" (Originally from Taiwan, this expression has spread to the mainland, where it is generally not considered to be vulgar. 尻 originally meant \"butt.\")\n\nAge\n lǎo bù sǐde 老不死的 (literally \"old [but] won't die\") An angry comment directed against old people who refuse to die and so clog up the ladder to promotion in some organization. It is implied that they have outlived their usefulness, which conveys a deeper meaning of that person inconveniencing or hogging a resource or benefit that is beneficial to the insulter (such as a job promotion) by being alive; thus the insulter wishes for their death. The expression comes from the Analects of Confucius where the Master complains against those who engage in heterodox practices aimed at assuring them extreme longevity. In the original these individuals are described as \"lǎo ér bù sǐ\" (老而不死), i.e., it is said that they \"are old but won't die.\"\n lǎo zéi 老賊 = lǎo bù sǐde (literally \"old thief\")\n lǎo tóuzi (), literally \"old head,\" it refers in a somewhat slighting way to old men. Its usage is rather like such expressions as \"old geezer\"  in English.\n lǎo tài pó = 老太婆 (literally \"old hag\")\n xiǎo guǐ = 小鬼,\" little devil/ghost\", is used familiarly and (usually) affectionately (c.f. \"rascal\" in English).\n xiǎo tù zǎizi 小兔崽子,\" little rabbit kitten,\" refers to someone young. Its usage is rather like such expressions as \"little brat\" in English.\n rǔ xiù wèi gān () Literally \"(the) smell (of) milk is not dry (=gone) yet,\" wet behind the ears.\n lǎo wán gù 老顽固, an old, stubborn, arrogant man.\n\nPromiscuity\nAs in the West, highly sexual women have been stigmatized. Terms for males who sleep around are rare.\n\n chāng fù () = bitch/whore\n húli jīng () = bitch (overly seductive woman or a golddigger; lit. \"fox spirit\")\n sānbā () = airhead, braggart, slut (lit. \"three eight\"). Used to insult women. One derivation claims that at one point in the Qing Dynasty, foreigners were only permitted to circulate on the eighth, eighteenth, and twenty-eighth of each month, and the Chinese deprecated these aliens by calling them , but others claim  refers to March 8: International Women's Day. In Taiwan, the term has less of a misogynistic connotation, and means \"silly\" or \"airhead.\"\n gōng gòng qì chē () = slut (lit. \"public bus\") used for a woman who sleeps around, as in \"everyone has had a ride\"\n biǎozi () = whore, slut\n jiàn nǚ rén () = bitch, cheap woman\n huā huā gōngzǐ () = playboy, notorious cheater (lit. \"Flower-Flower Prince\")\n sè láng () = womanizer, sex maniac (lit. \"Coloured Wolf\", in this context the adjective \"colour\" is a euphemism for \"lewd\")\n sè guǐ () = pervert (lit. \"Sex Ghost\", 色 can be read as both 'Color' and 'Sex')\n\nPositive connotations\nOccasionally, slang words with a negative connotation are turned around and used positively:\n\n wǒ cào () = An expression of impressed surprise or approval, akin to \"fuck me\", \"holy fuck\" or \"holy shit!\" in English (lit. \"I fuck\") Alternatively, \"我靠\" (wǒ kào, \"I lean on\". IM:KAO) or \"哇靠\" (wa kào) is used as a euphemism (similar to \"frigging\" \"frick\" in English) when the subject intends on being less obscene, such as when speaking in public.\n niúbī (/) = fucking awesome (literally \"cow cunt\"; possibly influenced by the expression chuī niú pí; , which means \"to brag\"). This phrase also has many alternative forms, including NB, 牛B, 牛比, 牛鼻 (\"cow's nose\"), as well as euphemisms such as 牛叉/牛X niúchā. It can also just be shortened to 牛.\n diǎo () / niǎo () = cock; this was an insult as long ago as the Jin Dynasty. Despite remaining a profane word in Cantonese, now it sometimes also means \"fucking cool\" or \"fucking outrageous\" in Mandarin. The positive expression is believed to have been invented by Sun Ta-Wei in an MTV Taiwan advertisement, but the pop star Jay Chou played a major role in its promotion. Because of the substitution of \"niǎo\" which means bird, sometimes English-speaking Chinese in Malaysia sometimes use \"birdie\" as a euphemism for \"penis\" for small children. Bird man sometimes has a derogative meaning as a \"wretch\", but also often used between close friends as affectionate appellation like \"fellow\".\n diǎo sī () = originally meant to mean male pubic hair, but means an unprivileged nobody.

The word is also used in Japanese, where it is pronounced \"chikushō\", often used as an expletive, akin to \"hell!\"\n qín shòu () = beasts (lit.: \"bird and animal\"), often used as qín shòu bù rú () = worse than beasts\n nǐ bú shì rén () = you're not human (lit.: \"you are not a person\"). This could also mean that the person is so mean/cruel that they are not human. In this instance, one can say \"你还是人吗\" nǐ hái shì rén ma (lit.: \"are you still human\")\n nǐ shì shénme dōngxi () = you're less than human, literally: What kind of object are you? (compares the level of a person to that of an object)\n nǐ búshì dōngxi () = you're less than human (implies less worth than an object)\n bùyàoliǎn de dōngxi () = you're shameless and less than human (lit.: \"you are a thing that has no shame\")\n jiànhuò () = lit. \"cheap goods\" (\"[you] despicable creature!\")\n sāohuò () = lit. \"lewd goods\" (\"[you] lewd creature!\")\n shuǐhuò () = lit. \"parallel import\"\n\nDeath\nSǐ (; \"dead\", \"cadaverous,\" or, less precisely, \"damn(ed)\") is used in a number of insults:\n\n sǐ guǐ () lit., \"dead imp,\" \"dead demon,\" \"dead ghost\".

They can all be used in compound words and sentences in a profane manner.\n\nOriginally, the various Mandarin Chinese words for \"excrement\" were less commonly used as expletives, but that is changing. Perhaps because farting results in something that is useless even for fertilizer: \"fàng pì\" (; lit. \"to fart\") is an expletive in Mandarin. The word \"pì\" (; lit. \"fart\") or the phrase is commonly used as an expletive in Mandarin (i.e. \"bullshit!\").\n\n qù chī dà biàn () [Go] Eat shit! (By itself,  is neither an expletive nor does it have the same effect as 'shit' in English.)\n chī shǐ () = Eat shit!\n shǐ dàn () Lit., \"shit egg\", a turd.\n fàng pì () = bullshit, nonsense, lie (literally \"to fart\"; used as an expletive as early as the Yuan dynasty.\n fàng nǐ mā de pì () = you are f—ing bullshitting (lit. \"release your mother's fart\")\n 'ge pì (个屁) = A common variation of 放屁, also meaning \"bullshit\" (as in lies, c.f.

The expressions contain metaphorical references to the following domesticated animals: dogs, cows, and chickens (12 or 11 terms each), (8 times), horse (4), cat (3), and duck (2), and one each to sheep, donkey and camel.  A variety of wild animals are used in these pejorative terms, and the most common are monkey (7 times) and tiger (5 times), symbolizing ugliness and power respectively.\n\nDogs\nThe fact that many insults are prefaced with the Mandarin Chinese word for dog attest to the animal's low status:\n\n gǒuzǎizi () = dog pup (English equivalent: \"son of a bitch\")\n gǒu pì () = bullshit, nonsense (lit. \"dog fart\"); in use as early as 1750 in the Qing Dynasty novel The Scholars.\n nǐ ge gǒu pì () = what you said is bullshit. Also \"nǐ ge pì\"()or simply \"pì\"().

Often used in the 20th century by communists to refer to client states of the United States and other capitalist powers.\n gǒutuǐzi () / gǒutuǐ () = Variant of zǒugǒu (), lit. \"dog thigh\"\n hǎ bā gǒu (哈巴狗) = someone who incessantly follows someone around, and is usually seen as a sycophant. (lit: \"pug dog\")\n\nRabbits\nIn at least one case, rabbit is part of an insult:\n xiǎotùzǎizi () = rabbit kitten (quite ironically, this insult is often used by parents to insult their children)\n\nHorse\n mǎzi () = a derogatory word for girlfriend. (Possibly influenced by U.S. slang, \"filly,\" used for any girl.)\n\nBird\nThe Chinese word for bird \"niǎo\"() was pronounced as \"diǎo\" in ancient times, which rhymes with () meaning penis or sexual organ. It also sounds the same as \"penis\" in several Chinese dialects. Thus, bird is often associated with 'fuck', 'penis' or 'nonsense'：\n wǒ niǎo nǐ () = I give a shit about you (Beijing dialect)\n wǒ niǎo tā de () = I give a shit about him\n niǎo huà () = bullshit, fucking words ; nǐ zài jiǎng shénme niǎo huà () = What fucking words are you talking about?\n niǎo rén () = bastard, asshole.

It is used to portray a studious person as lacking either hands-on experience or social skills. Often used academically to describe one who is too by the book, and unable to adapt to changing circumstances that invalidate book theory. Unlike \"nerd\", shūdāizi is rarely used in the context of hobbies.\n bì zuǐ, () = Shut up!\n\nAction specific\nSome expressions represent offensive insults involving some kind of actions:\n\n gǔnkāi () = go to hell/fuck off (lit. roll or roll away)\n nǐgěiwǒgǔn () = get out of my sight!

This term has seen increasing usage in internet communities critical of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nAgainst Westerners\n baí pí zhū (白皮猪) — \"white skin pigs\" a slur for white people, as they regarded on the implication that Whites are perceived to be lazier and less diligent in comparison to their Han Chinese counterparts. \n baí pí (白皮) — \"white skins\" a slur for white people.\n yáng guǐzi (洋鬼子) — \"Foreign devil\", a slur for white foreigners.\n guǐlǎo () — Borrowed from Cantonese \"Gweilo\", \"devil\" or \"devil guy\", a slur for Westerners in Hong Kong.\n hóng máo guǐzi () — \"Red fur devil\", rude slang term for Caucasians, especially Caucasians from English speaking countries (see ang mo)\n máo zi () – Ethnic slur against Russians.

This is used mostly in the context of the Second Sino-Japanese War, when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China. This is the title of a Japanese documentary on Japanese war crimes during WWII.\n dōngyáng guǐzi () — Literally \"Oriental devil\". An anti-Japanese variant of yáng guǐzi, and similar to Rìběn guǐzi above. (Note that whereas the term 東洋 has the literal meaning of \"Orient\" in the Japanese language, the characters themselves mean \"eastern ocean\", and it refers to Japan exclusively in modern Chinese usage—since Japan is the country which lies in the ocean east of China.)\n Wō (倭) — This was an ancient Chinese name for Japan, but was also adopted by the Japanese. Today, its usage in Chinese is usually intended to give a negative connotation (see Wōkòu below). The character is said to also mean \"dwarf\", although that meaning was not apparent when the name was first used. See Wa (Japan).\n Wōkòu (倭寇) — Originally referred to Japanese pirates and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the Ming Dynasty (see Wokou). The term was adopted during the Second Sino-Japanese War to refer to invading Japanese forces, (similarly to Germans being called Huns).

The word is used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n dà Jiǎopén zú (大腳盆族) — Ethnic slur towards Japanese used predominantly by Northern Chinese, mainly those from the city of Tianjin. Literally \"big-feet-like-washbasins race\", also punning on the English \"Japan\".\n huáng jūn () — a pun on the homophone \"皇軍\" (huáng jūn, literally \"Imperial Army\"), the definition of 黃 (huáng) used is \"yellow\". This phrase 黃軍 (\"Yellow Army\") was used during World War II to represent Japanese soldiers due to the colour of their uniform. Today, it is used negatively against all Japanese. Since the stereotype of Japanese soldiers is commonly portrayed in war-related TV series in China as short men, with a toothbrush moustache (and sometimes round glasses, in the case of higher ranks), 黃軍 is also often used to pull jokes on Chinese people with these characteristics, and thus \"appear like\" Japanese soldiers.\n zì wèi duì () — A pun on the homophone \"自衛隊\" (zì wèi duì, literally \"Self-Defence Forces\"), the definition of 慰 (wèi) used is \"to comfort\". This phrase is used to refer to Japanese (whose military force is known as \"自衛隊\") being stereotypically hypersexual, as \"自慰队\" means \"Self-comforting Forces\", referring to masturbation. The word 慰 (wèi) also carries highly negative connotations of \"慰安婦\" (wèi ān fù, \"Comfort women\"), referring to the use of sex slaves by the Japanese military during World War II.\nwěi jūn (伪军）- Literally \"pretender army.\" The word is used as an insult to collaborationist Chinese forces during World War II, but is occasionally used to refer to Japanese forces as well. It is used officially by Chinese historians, and is specifically spoken towards those people, making it a rare and ineffective insult against Japanese people in general.\n\nAgainst Koreans\n Gāolì bàng zǐ () — A neutral term used against all ethnic Koreans . 高丽/高麗 refers to Ancient Korea (Koryo), while 棒子 means \"club\" or \"corncob\", referring to how Korean security guards hired by the Japanese during WW2 were not given guns, only clubs/batons as they were untrustworthy. The term is modernized sometimes as 韓棒子 (hán bàng zǐ, \"韓\" referring to South Korea)\n sǐ bàng zǐ (死棒子) — Literally \"dead club\" or \"dead plank\" with the sexual innuendo of a \"useless or dead erection\"; refer to 高丽棒子 above.\n èr guǐ zǐ (二鬼子) — (See 日本鬼子) During World War II, 二鬼子 referred to Traitors among the Han Chinese hanjian and Koreans in the Imperial Japanese Army, as the Japanese were known as \"鬼子\" (devils) for massacring innocent children and women. 二鬼子 literally means \"second devils\". Today, 二鬼子 is used to describe ethnic Koreans who had been absorbed into Japan and joined the Japanese Imperial Army. It is rarely used as a slur in recent times.\n Běihán gòngfěi (北韩共匪) – Literally \"North Korean communist bandits\". Used by the anti-communists in Taiwan towards the Workers' Party of Korea as well as the North Koreans.\n\nAgainst South Asians\n\nAgainst Indians\n yìndù ā sān (印度阿三) — A euphemism to Indians. It means \"Indian, Hassan\".\n ā chā (阿差) — A popular term common among the Cantonese in Hong Kong to refer to Indians. The term derives from the frequent uttering of ācchā 'good, fine' by (Northern) Indians (cf. Hindi अच्छा) Originally referring to the Punjabi \"singhs\" security force who used to work for the British government during colonial era. Nowadays, any South Asian is referred to as \"ā chā\". In Cantonese, \"Ah\" means \"Dude\", so \"Ah Cha\" means the dude called \"Cha\". It is not an ethnic slur, it is used because Cantonese cannot pronounce \"Indian\" as it derives from a Mandarin term that sounds too formal.\n gālí rén (咖喱人) — Literally \"curry person.\" A much more common contemporary term used to refer to Indians, derived from the use of curry in Indian cuisine and the perception that Indians eat food to some Chinese find to give off a strong smell, and to which Indians typically eat with their hands, a practice that many Chinese find to be dirty and unclean. For these two reasons, it is applied as a derogatory term to Indians.\n\nAgainst Southeast Asians\n\nAgainst Filipinos\nHuanna () – a  Hokkien term in literally meaning \"foreigner or non-Chinese.\" Used by most Overseas Chinese to refer generally to indigenous Southeast Asians and Taiwanese Aborigines. In the Philippines, this term is used by Chinese Filipinos towards indigenous Filipinos.\n\nAgainst Indonesians\n yìnníbazi ( or ) — lit. \"Indonesian mud\", an ethnic slur towards that refers a play on \"\" (Indonesia) and \"\" (mud), where  are homophones, thus associating Pribumi Indonesians as being primitive, backward, uncivilized, and dirty.\n\nAgainst Vietnamese\n lǎo yuè () – Literally \"Old Vietnamese\", or \"Old Guy from Vietnam\". It is not an anti-Vietnamese slur but rather a familial slang term for Vietnamese.\n Xiǎo Yuenán () – Literally \"little Vietnam[ese]\". This can be used in a derogatory context, referring Vietnam's smaller geographical size than China, darker skin tone, and the lower average stature of Vietnamese in comparison with their Han Chinese counterparts.\n Yuenán houzǐ () –  Literally means \"Vietnamese monkeys.\" A term used by the Han Chinese to derogatorily refer towards Vietnamese by associating them as being uncivilized, barbaric, dirty, primitive, and backward people. This term also alludes to the historical region of Nam Viet (南越 which in Chinese translates to \"land of the southern barbarians\"), a province that was ruled by the Han dynasty during the First Chinese domination of Vietnam; when mixed with the word \"southern barbarian\" (南蠻) is also used as an ethnic slur towards the Vietnamese by the Han Chinese.\n Yuenán gòngfei or Yue gòngfei ( or ) – Literally means \"Vietnamese communist bandits\". A variation of gòngfei, this was directed at the Viet Cong by anti-communists during the Vietnam War. While rarely used today, this term is still also used by Taiwanese anti-communists to refer to the Communist Party of Vietnam, or Vietnamese Communists in general.\n\nOther\n lǎo mò (老墨) —  Literally \"Old Mexican\", an ethnic slur used towards Mexicans. 墨 should not be confused with \"ink\", which bears the same character and pronunciation from \"墨\" in 墨西哥 (Mexico).\n hēi guǐzi () or hēi guǐ () — Literally \"Black devil\", racial slur directed towards people of Sub-Saharan Black African descent. The term is similar to the English term \"nigger\" as an ethnic slur directed at blacks.\n tǔbāozi () — Literally \"Mud baozi/muddy baozi\". An insult directed at those seen as uncultured or backward, implying that the insulted person comes from a peasant background. Roughly equivalent to the English phrases \"country bumpkin\" and \"hayseed\". The term can also be used without any negative connotations to denote someone who is new, unfamiliar and inexperienced in any profession or activity, roughly similar to the English internet gaming slang \"noob.\"\n xiāngjiāo rén () — 'Banana People' – a term used to refer to any person of Overseas Chinese ancestry who have assimilated in the Western world and have lost any true Chinese trait. As the insult implies, they are like bananas: Yellow (Chinese) on the outside while white (western) on the inside (akin to \"Oreo\" for African Americans or \"coconut\" for Hispanic-Americans).\n\nHomosexuality\nThere are various circumlocutions in Mandarin Chinese for homosexual, and the formal terms are recent additions just as is the direct translation of \"masturbation\" (hand soiling). The words listed below are generally not regarded as being profane.\n\nDuànxiù () — cut off sleeve, from the story of a ruler whose male favourite fell asleep on the sleeve of his jacket, so when the ruler had to get up to conduct some needed business he cut his sleeve off rather than awaken his lover (See Bret Hinsch, Passions of the Cut Sleeve, p. 53). An analogous story, of a sleeve being cut off so as not to disturb a sleeping cat, is told of both Confucius and Muhammad, and perhaps others.\n\nYútáo () — remains of a peach, from the story of a favourite who rather too familiarly offered his sovereign a peach of which he had already eaten half. (From Han Fei Zi, chapter 12)\n\nBōlí (), literally \"glass\", but implies \"glass person\". It comes from a passage in the Dream of the Red Chamber in which Phoenix is described as having a \"crystal heart in a glass body,\" meaning that she was glistening, pure, clear, fastidious, etc. It stands as high praise for a lady, but comes off as an effeminate slur when referring to men. The English translation of Bai Xian-yong's novel about male homosexuals in Taiwan includes the term \"crystal boys,\" derived from the same passage in the earlier novel, and also a rather gruff reference to the old photographer who befriends some of the boys as \"you old glass,\" which, delivered by a female friend of his, comes out sounding about on the level of \"you old fart,\" i.e., not really so very offensive, but indicating a passing mood of aggravation on the speaker's part. Nevertheless, the general meaning is probably closer to \"old queer.\"\n\nNán fēng (), male custom, is homophonous with (, southern custom.) The first writing of the term would fairly easily be picked out as referring to sexual interactions, whereas the second term could just mean \"the customs of the southern part of China.\"\n\nTóngzhì (; ) was recently adopted in Hong Kong and Taiwan to mean homosexual, and is sometimes used on the mainland. Literally the term means \"one having same aspirations\".\n\nTùzi (), used to refer to catamites (lit. rabbit). (See Herbert A.

{"id": "4107571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20New%20Hope%20Church", "title": "Battle of New Hope Church", "text": "The Battle of New Hope Church (May 25–26, 1864) was a clash between the Union Army under Major General William T. Sherman and the Confederate Army of Tennessee led by General Joseph E. Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War. Sherman broke loose from his railroad supply line in a large-scale sweep in an attempt to force Johnston's army to retreat from its strong position south of the Etowah River. Sherman hoped that he had outmaneuvered his opponent, but Johnston rapidly shifted his army to the southwest. When the Union XX Corps under Major General Joseph Hooker tried to force its way through the Confederate lines at New Hope Church, its soldiers were stopped with heavy losses.\n\nEarlier in May, Sherman successfully maneuvered Johnston's army into retreating from three separate defensive positions. However, when Sherman's army crossed the Etowah River and attempted to move around Johnston's left flank, the Confederate general anticipated his opponent's intentions. Sherman believed that the way was clear, when in fact, Johnston quickly shifted his army into a blocking position. At New Hope Church, Hooker's corps aggressively pressed forward but its attack received a stinging repulse from one division of John Bell Hood's Confederate corps, which was well-entrenched. Thwarted, Sherman next tried to move around Johnston's right flank.\n\nBackground\n\nUnion Army\n\nOn April 30, Sherman's host numbered 110,000 soldiers of which 99,000 were available for \"offensive purposes\". All of the Union army's 254 guns consisted of 12-pounder Napoleons, 10-pounder Parrott rifles, 20-pounder Parrott rifles, and 3-inch Ordnance rifles. The 25,000 non-combatants accompanying the army included railroad employees and repair crews, teamsters, medical staff, and Black camp servants. Sherman directed elements of three armies. The Army of the Cumberland led by Major General George H. Thomas counted 73,000 troops and 130 guns, the Army of the Tennessee under Major General James B. McPherson numbered 24,500 soldiers and 96 guns, and the Army of the Ohio commanded by Major General John Schofield had 11,362 infantry, 2,197 cavalry, and 28 guns.\n\nThomas' army consisted of the IV Corps under Major General Oliver Otis Howard, the XIV Corps under Major General John M. Palmer, the XX Corps under Major General Joseph Hooker, and three cavalry divisions led by Brigadier Generals Edward M. McCook, Kenner Garrard, and Hugh Judson Kilpatrick. McPherson's army comprised the XV Corps under Major General John A. Logan and the Left Wing of the XVI Corps under Brigadier General Grenville M. Dodge. The XVII Corps under Major General Francis Preston Blair Jr. did not join until June 8. Schofield's army was made up of the XXIII Corps under Schofield and a cavalry division led by Major General George Stoneman. The IV and XX Corps each counted 20,000 soldiers, the XIV Corps had 22,000, the XV Corps totaled 11,500, and the XVI and XVII Corps each numbered about 10,000 men.\n\nConfederate Army\n\nOn April 30, Johnston's army counted 41,279 men present for duty in seven infantry divisions. There were 3,227 artillerymen present for duty serving 144 guns. Many of the guns were inferior to the Federal artillery pieces, but the crews were experienced. There were 10,000 cavalrymen, but only 8,500 present for duty and many horses were in poor condition. There were probably 8,000 non-combatants supporting the army, many of whom were disabled by wounds or otherwise unfit for combat. Johnston's Army of Tennessee included two infantry corps led by Lieutenant Generals William J. Hardee and John Bell Hood, and a cavalry corps under Major General Joseph Wheeler. The army was soon joined by the corps of Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk and the cavalry division of Brigadier General William H. Jackson. Hardee's corps consisted of the divisions of Major Generals Benjamin F. Cheatham, Patrick Cleburne, William H. T. Walker, and William B. Bate. Hood's corps included the divisions of Major Generals Thomas C. Hindman, Carter L. Stevenson, and Alexander P. Stewart. Polk's corps comprised the divisions of Major Generals William Wing Loring and Samuel Gibbs French, and Brigadier General James Cantey.\n\nOperations\n \nSherman launched his campaign on May 7, 1864, with the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge during which he turned Johnston's western flank. This was followed by the Battle of Resaca on May 13–15 at which time Polk's corps began arriving. After Sherman turned his western flank again, Johnston withdrew. At the Battle of Cassville, Johnston tried to strike at Sherman's army, but the opportunity was fumbled. On May 19, Polk and Hood convinced Johnston to retreat to Allatoona Pass. Johnston conducted the withdrawal south of the Etowah River skillfully, leaving few stragglers behind. Schofield's corps passed through Cartersville and reached the Etowah to find the bridges burnt and the Confederates gone. The Western and Atlantic Railroad ran through a gorge at Allatoona Pass and Johnston posted his army there in an extremely strong defensive position.\n\nSherman planned to force Johnston's army to retreat behind the Chattahoochee River. To do this he decided to outflank Johnston's army on the west by marching to Dallas and then Marietta. On May 20, Sherman ordered his army to be ready to move on May 23. Since it would be leaving the railroad line, the army carried 20 days of supplies in its wagons and evacuated all its wounded and unfit men to the rear. Sherman was anxious about his railroad supply line which ran  back to Chattanooga. Fearing the railroad might be damaged by Confederate cavalry raids, Sherman ordered Brigadier General John E. Smith's XV Corps division from Huntsville, Alabama, and nine XXIII Corps regiments from East Tennessee and Kentucky forward to guard the Western and Atlantic Railroad. To replace these units, he summoned northern state governors to recruit 100-day regiments to garrison the rear area railroads.\n\nSherman directed McPherson's two corps on his right wing to march from Kingston south to Van Wert and then east to Dallas. Since Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis' division (XIV Corps) was already to the west at Rome, it moved with McPherson. Thomas' three corps were ordered to march south through Euharlee and Stilesboro toward Dallas. Garrard's cavalry covered McPherson's wing, while McCook's horsemen scouted ahead of Thomas's center. Preceded by Stoneman, Schofield's left wing marched from Cartersville to the Etowah. Stoneman's cavalry found Milam's Bridge burned and a pontoon bridge was laid nearby. Hooker crossed his XX Corps ahead of Schofield's XXIII Corps and therefore was able to move ahead of Thomas' other two corps.\n\nUnsure if Sherman was moving around his left flank, Johnston ordered Wheeler's cavalry to cross to the north bank of the Etowah to see if Sherman's army was still there. On May 24 Wheeler reported that Sherman's army was to the west near Kingston. Avoiding Kilpatrick's cavalry, which was patrolling the area, Wheeler's horsemen captured 70 wagons and burned others. Also on May 24, McPherson reached a point  west of Dallas. Riding ahead, Garrard's troopers reported that Confederate infantry was at Dallas. Hooker reached Burnt Hickory ahead of Thomas' other corps; Schofield's corps was to the northeast. Alerted by reports from Jackson's cavalry division, Johnston deduced that the Union army was maneuvering to turn his left flank. That afternoon, McCook's horsemen captured a Confederate courier with a message that Johnston's army was moving toward Dallas. Nevertheless, Sherman remained confident that Johnston would not try to block him at Dallas; he ordered his army to press forward.\n\nBattle\n\nOn the morning of May 25, Hardee's corps took position at Dallas, blocking the road to Marietta, with Polk's corps on its right flank. On the far right flank, Hood's corps moved into position near New Hope Church, northeast of Dallas. Hood posted Hindman's division on the left flank and Stevenson's division on the right flank. Stewart's division deployed in the center, reinforced by one of Stevenson's brigades. Hood's soldiers immediately dug rifle pits and piled up breastworks of logs and rocks. Confederate observers on Elsberry Mountain reported seeing dust clouds that indicated Sherman's troops were coming. That afternoon, Hood's troops captured a Union soldier who admitted that he belonged to Hooker's corps.\n\nOn May 25, McPherson's left wing took the road southeast from Van Wert to Dallas. Davis' division turned off to the east on a side road. Hooker's XX Corps marched on the road from Burnt Hickory to Dallas, with Brigadier General John W. Geary's division on the main road. The other divisions advanced on minor roads, with Brigadier General Alpheus S. Williams to the right and Major General Daniel Butterfield to the left of the main road. The IV and XIV Corps marched to the right of Hooker's corps and Schofield's corps remained close to Burnt Hickory. At Pumpkinvine Creek, the Federals found some Confederates trying to set the bridge on fire. Hooker's cavalry escort drove off the bridge-burners and Geary's troops crossed the stream. At the left fork in the road near Owen's Mills, Geary's division took the route toward New Hope Church. As his column advanced, it was met by determined resistance by the 32nd Alabama and 58th Alabama Infantry Regiments and Austin's Sharpshooters under Colonel Bushrod Jones. Geary was compelled to deploy Colonel Charles Candy's brigade in an extended skirmish line in order to drive Jones' Confederates back.\n\nGeary's troops took several prisoners who told them that Hood's corps was directly ahead. Both Thomas and Hooker were startled by this information because, like Sherman, they did not expect to run into major opposition so soon. Fearing that Geary's troops were exposed to a sudden attack, Thomas summoned the divisions of Williams and Butterfield to march rapidly to Geary's assistance. Having marched down the right fork toward Dallas, Williams' troops had to retrace their route to Owen's Mills, then turn right into the road Geary had taken. Between 4 pm and 5 pm, both Williams' and Butterfield's troops reinforced Geary. Still convinced that only minor Confederate forces were in the Dallas area, Sherman ordered Thomas to attack; Thomas passed the order to Hooker.\n\nSoon after 5 pm, Hooker gave the order to attack, with Williams' division on the right and Butterfield's division on the left and Geary's division in support. Butterfield's line was slightly behind Williams in order to protect against a flank attack. All three divisions were formed in columns of brigades. That is, within each division, each brigade was deployed in line, one behind the other.  All three divisions advanced about  through dense woods and underbrush. In Williams' division, Hooker and Williams rode behind the first brigade. When the troops reached the bottom of a slope, they were greeted by a storm of rifle and artillery fire. The Union soldiers threw themselves to the ground behind whatever cover they could find and fired back. As they came under fire, Butterfield's and Geary's soldiers also lay down. The 4,000 Confederate defenders belonged to Stewart's division, with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Marcellus Augustus Stovall, Henry D. Clayton, and Alpheus Baker in the front line, from left to right, and Brigadier General Randall L. Gibson's brigade in reserve. Stewart's line was also supported by 16 cannons. Though facing 16,000 Federals, Stewart's entrenched soldiers had no trouble defending their position.\n\nThe Union generals hoped that their opponents would be caught in the open, but it became clear that the Confederates were protected by earth and log field fortifications. The only clearly visible target was a Confederate artillery battery, which took casualties. Williams' first brigade under Colonel James S. Robinson fired off its 60 rounds per man and was replaced in the battle line by Brigadier General Thomas H. Ruger's brigade. Brigadier General Joseph F. Knipe's brigade waited in the third line. Johnston, who arrived at Hood's headquarters that afternoon, asked Stewart if he needed reinforcements. Stewart replied, \"My own troops will hold the position.\" The battle went on for three hours, and during the last hour a thunderstorm added its noise and rain to the din of battle. Hooker reported suffering 1,665 killed and wounded. The Union troops called the battlefield the \"Hell Hole\". As the defeated Federals slowly withdrew, the Confederates gave a cheer. Stewart reported losing 300–400 casualties. Another source stated there were 1,665 Union and 400 Confederate casualties.\n\nAftermath\n\nJohnston and Hood both commended Stewart for his successful defense. On the other hand, Sherman was badly disappointed that his maneuver was so unexpectedly blocked. Sherman hated Hooker and unfairly criticized him for not immediately pushing ahead with Geary's division. Sherman believed that by waiting for his other two divisions to arrive, Hooker allowed the Confederates time to entrench. He hoped that he was only facing Hood's corps, but it was finally beginning to dawn on him that Johnston's entire army was in front of him. The sound of fighting was heard in Atlanta and caused a minor panic among the civilians there.\n\nDuring the night, the Union army entrenched, and skirmishing continued throughout May 26. McPherson's wing and Davis' division occupied Dallas in the afternoon and established a position two miles farther east. The troops of Thomas and Schofield concentrated near New Hope Church. A  gap existed between Thomas and McPherson, but it was concealed by the heavily wooded terrain. Likewise, there was a gap between Hardee's corps east of Dallas and the corps of Hood and Polk at New Hope Church. Johnston detached Cleburne's division from Hardee and added it to his right flank. Thwarted in his attempt to turn the Confederate left flank, Sherman decided to attack the Confederate right flank. His efforts resulted in the Battle of Pickett's Mill on May 27.\n\nBattlefield\nMuch of the New Hope Church battlefield is today privately owned and is located at the intersection of Bobo Road and Hwy 381 (Dallas Acworth Hwy) in Dallas.

Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign in the American Civil War. Sherman sent Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood's division, supported by other formations, to turn Johnston's right flank, but the Federals were repulsed with heavy casualties when they ran into tenacious Confederate opposition. Author Ambrose Bierce, an eyewitness, later wrote an account of the battle titled The Crime at Pickett's Mill.\n\nEarlier in May 1864, Sherman's army successfully compelled the Confederate Army of Tennessee to fall back to a strong defensive position at Allatoona Pass. Unwilling to attack Johnston's lines frontally, Sherman attempted a wide sweep around the Confederate western flank. Johnston quickly shifted his army southwest to block the move, and Sherman's first thrust at his opponent's defenses was defeated at New Hope Church. Both sides entrenched their positions. A day after Sherman's troops were beaten at Pickett's Mill, the Confederates launched an attack on the Union right flank which was repelled at Dallas. The two armies faced each other in the New Hope Church and Dallas lines until Sherman extended his left flank toward the railroad, compelling Johnston to retreat to a new position on June 4.\n\nBackground\n\nUnion Army\n\nIn the Atlanta campaign, William T. Sherman commanded a force made up of three armies drawn from the Military Division of the Mississippi. On April 30, 1864, the Army of the Cumberland led by Major General George H. Thomas included 73,000 troops and 130 guns, the Army of the Tennessee under Major General James B. McPherson numbered 24,500 soldiers and 96 guns, and the Army of the Ohio directed by Major General John Schofield reported 11,362 infantry, 2,197 cavalry, and 28 guns. Sherman's forces were supported by 25,000 non-combatants consisting of railroad employees and repair crews, teamsters, medical staff, and Black camp servants. Thomas' army was made up of Major General Oliver Otis Howard's IV Corps, Major General John M. Palmer's XIV Corps, Major General Joseph Hooker's XX Corps, and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Cavalry Divisions led by Brigadier Generals Edward M. McCook, Kenner Garrard, and Hugh Judson Kilpatrick, respectively. McPherson's army consisted of Major General John A. Logan's XV Corps and Brigadier General Grenville M. Dodge's Left Wing of the XVI Corps. Major General Francis Preston Blair Jr.'s XVII Corps joined McPherson's army on June 8. Schofield's small army included his own XXIII Corps and a cavalry division led by Major General George Stoneman. The IV and XX Corps each counted 20,000 soldiers, the XIV Corps had 22,000, the XV Corps numbered 11,500, and the XVI and XVII Corps each included about 10,000 men.\n\nConfederate Army\n\nJohnston's Army of Tennessee consisted of two infantry corps led by Lieutenant Generals William J. Hardee and John Bell Hood, and a cavalry corps under Major General Joseph Wheeler. Johnston's army was soon reinforced by the corps of Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk and the cavalry division of Brigadier General William Hicks Jackson from the Army of Mississippi. Hardee's corps included the divisions of Major Generals William B. Bate, Benjamin F. Cheatham, Patrick Cleburne, and William H. T. Walker. Hood's corps was made up of the divisions of Major Generals Thomas C. Hindman, Carter L. Stevenson, and Alexander P. Stewart. Polk's corps had the divisions of Major Generals Samuel Gibbs French and William Wing Loring, and Brigadier General James Cantey. On April 30, 1864, Johnston's Army of Tennessee reported 41,279 infantry, 8,436 cavalry, and 3,227 artillerymen serving 144 guns. Battles and Leaders calculated Johnston's reinforcements as follows: Brigadier General Hugh W. Mercer's brigade (2,800) on May 2, Cantey's division (5,300) on May 7, Loring's division (5,145) on May 10–12, French's detachment (550) on May 12, Jackson's cavalry (4,477) on May 17, French's division (4,174) on May 19, Brigadier General William Andrew Quarles' brigade (2,200) on May 26, and a 643-man detachment of Jackson's cavalry on June 10. Other reinforcements came from two Georgia state regiments (1,200), men returned from furlough, recruits, and returned deserters. There were about 8,000 non-combatants supporting Johnston's army, mostly men unfit for combat.\n\nOperations\n \nThe Atlanta campaign began with the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge on May 5–9, 1864, when Sherman sent McPherson's two corps to turn Johnston's defenses from the west while Thomas and Schofield demonstrated frontally. Outflanked, Johnston retreated and fought the Battle of Resaca on 13–16 May, by which time Polk's corps began arriving. With his western flank menaced, Johnston withdrew again and Union troops captured Rome. At the Battle of Cassville on May 19, Johnston planned to counterattack part of Sherman's widely-spread army, but timing was ruined when McCook's cavalry appeared in an unexpected location. Johnston then took up a defensive position south of Cassville. Hood and Polk argued that the Cassville line was vulnerable to Union artillery fire, so Johnston retreated to Allatoona Pass on the night of May 19–20. Finding Johnston's position too strong to directly attack, Sherman decided to make another maneuver around Johnston's western flank. After pausing operations for three days, Sherman sent McPherson's right wing south to Van Wert and then east toward Dallas. Thomas's army formed Sherman's center and Schofield's corps his left.\n\nAt the start of the latest Union maneuver, Sherman ordered 20 days rations be carried in his wagons because they were leaving the proximity of the railroad. Thomas' army crossed the Etowah River and marched through Euharlee and Stilesboro, while Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis' 2nd Division, XIV Corps, which was detached at Rome, joined the movement of McPherson's wing. Blair's XVII Corps was approaching from the north, but had not yet joined Sherman. Garrard's cavalry preceded McPherson's columns, McCook's cavalry covered Thomas' front, Stoneman's cavalry headed Schofield's columns, and Kilpatrick's cavalry watched the railroad north of the Etowah. Johnston received news of Sherman's move from Jackson's cavalry, and on the afternoon of May 23, he ordered Hardee's corps to march to Dallas and Polk's corps to follow. On May 24, Johnston ordered Hood's corps to join the others. By May 25, Johnston's army was positioned so that Hardee's corps was on the left near Dallas and Hood's corps was on the right at New Hope Church. Polk's corps was posted to the left of Hood, with a lightly defended gap between Polk and Hardee.\n\nHooker's XX Corps led the advance of Thomas' Army of the Cumberland. When it reached Pumpkinvine Creek at Owen's Mill, the Federals drove off some Confederates who were trying to burn the bridge. Strongly resisted by three Confederate regiments, Brigadier General John W. Geary's 2nd Division pressed forward until it came into contact with Hood's corps at New Hope Church. It was 5 pm before Hooker was able to reinforce Geary with the divisions of Brigadier General Alpheus S. Williams (1st) and Major General Daniel Butterfield (3rd). Each of the three divisions were formed into brigade columns, that is, with the leading brigade deployed and the two other brigades of the division directly behind it. In the Battle of New Hope Church on May 25, Hooker's divisions repeatedly assaulted the ridge that Hood's troops defended, but without success. The battle lasted three hours, and during its last hour a thunderstorm rumbled overhead. Hooker admitted sustaining losses of 1,665 killed and wounded in a place the Union troops began calling the \"Hell Hole\". Stewart's division, which was the main defending force, reported losing 300–400 casualties.\n\nThe leading unit of Howard's IV Corps, which was Brigadier General John Newton's 2nd Division, arrived in the area of New Hope Church at 6 pm and was placed in line on the left of Hooker's corps. By the morning of May 26, Howard's entire corps was fully deployed. Regarding Palmer's XIV Corps, Brigadier General Absalom Baird's 3rd Division was assigned to guard Thomas' wagon train at Burnt Hickory and Brigadier General Richard W. Johnson's 1st Division was placed in reserve behind Hooker. On the morning of May 26, McPherson's two corps occupied Dallas and confronted Hardee's corps about  farther east. McPherson deployed Logan's XV Corps on the right, Dodge's XVI Corps in the center, and Davis' XIV Corps division on the left. Between Davis and Hooker, there was a lightly defended area. Schofield's XXIII Corps left Brigadier General Alvin Peterson Hovey's division to watch the wagon train and proceeded with the divisions of Brigadier Generals Jacob Dolson Cox and Milo S. Hascall. Schofield's corps reached the battlefield after an all night march in the rain. During the night, Schofield was injured when his horse fell into a ravine, so Cox temporarily assumed command of the corps. In the morning, Sherman directed the corps to the left of Howard's corps and, after marching by compass through thick woods, it came into line near Brown's saw-mill. At this point, the XXIII Corps and the left of the IV Corps made a right wheel to face toward the Confederate defensive positions. On May 26, both sides entrenched and the day was notable for the continuous skirmishing that took place between the two sides.\n\nBattle\n\nThe maneuver\n\nSherman decided to turn Johnston's right flank. Aware of his numerical superiority, and with both armies entrenched, Sherman decided that he could assemble some of his troops and use them to outflank the Confederate defenses. In addition, by extending his left flank northward, Sherman was able to get closer to the railroad line. Also on May 26, McCook's cavalry bested Wheeler's horsemen in a skirmish, capturing 50 Confederates. This clash seemed to indicate that Johnston's right flank was only defended by cavalry.\n\nOn May 27, the artillery of Schofield, Howard, and Hooker bombarded the Confederate defenses starting at dawn, and the opposing batteries replied. Sherman wanted Howard, supported by Schofield's divisions, to thrust at what he believed to be Johnston's right flank while McPherson pressed back the Confederate left flank. At dawn, Howard withdrew Thomas J. Wood's division (IV Corps) from its newly-dug trenches and replaced it with David S. Stanley's division. As Wood's division marched north, Thomas and Howard conducted a reconnaissance of the location where Sherman wanted to attack. Finding that the assault would have to cross an open field subject to Confederate cross fire, Thomas instructed Howard to shift the assault location farther north, to the left of Schofield's lines. Thomas also detached Johnson's 1st Division from XIV Corps so that it could support Wood's attack. Furious that first Davis' and now Johnson's divisions were taken away from him, Palmer threatened to resign command of XIV Corps, and Thomas had to talk him out of it.\n\nAt 11 am, Wood's division was formed into a column of brigades with each brigade formed into two lines, so that the division was deployed into six lines, one behind the other. Johnson's division was formed into a similar column. The Union divisions marched through forests so dense that Wood gave the colonel of his leading regiment a compass to guide the movement. After marching , Howard ordered Wood's and Johnson's columns to turn to the right and prepare to attack. Wood's skirmishers went forward and discovered entrenched Confederates in front, so Howard decided to attack farther north. Howard ordered Brigadier General Nathaniel McLean's brigade to support Wood's right flank; McLean's command was the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, XXIII Corps. The crucial defense of McLean's brigade at the Second Battle of Bull Run may have prevented a Union catastrophe, but bad blood existed between McLean and Howard. Historian Albert Castel asserted, \"Of all the brigade commanders in Sherman's army, a worse one to assist in Howard's attack could not have been found.\" Howard blamed McLean among others for the disaster to XI Corps at the Battle of Chancellorsville and McLean detested Howard for it.\n\nEarlier, Johnston transferred Cleburne's division from Hardee's corps to the extreme right flank. On Cleburne's left was Hindman's division of Hood's corps. Cleburne's division was entrenched with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Mark Perrin Lowrey and Daniel Govan in the front line and the brigades of Brigadier Generals Lucius E. Polk and Hiram B. Granbury in reserve. Govan's scouts reported Howard's movement to Johnston, who ordered probes of the Federal lines, believing that Sherman was making a general retreat to the railroad. These probes captured some Union skirmishers but quickly discovered that Sherman's defenses were well-manned. With this information, Johnston realized that Sherman was trying to turn his right flank. He directed Hindman's troops to shift to their right and ordered Stewart's division to help Cleburne. At this time, McPherson notified Sherman that the Confederate troops in front of him were strongly entrenched. Sherman finally understood that Johnston blocked his plan to sweep around the Confederate western flank. Sherman quickly discarded his original strategy and replaced it with a plan to move northeast to the railroad.\n\nThe attack\n\nAfter marching an additional , Wood's and Johnson's troops reached a north-flowing stream called Pickett's Mill Creek. This tributary of Pumpkinvine Creek was named after a nearby grist mill, owned by Malachi Pickett. Howard and Wood conducted another reconnaissance and discovered Confederates digging trenches, but the entrenchments did not extend to the left. Howard ordered Wood and Johnson to swing their divisions to the right, and directed McLean to make a false attack which was designed to draw fire away from Wood's real attack. Wood rapidly formed his division for assault, but both Johnson and McLean moved their commands very slowly. At 3:35 pm, Howard sent a courier notifying his superior Thomas that he was, \"turning the enemy's right flank, I think\". Thomas' reply arrived at 4 pm to go ahead with the attack. Even so, Howard hesitated until Wood asked, \"Are the orders still to attack?\" Howard gave the order to attack.\n\nWood's division consisted of the brigades of Colonel William Harvey Gibson (1st), Brigadier General William Babcock Hazen (2nd), and Colonel Frederick Knefler (3rd). At 4:30 pm, Wood ordered Hazen's brigade, which was in front, to advance. Wood remarked to Howard, \"We will put in Hazen, and see what success he has,\" and Howard agreed. Previously, Hazen believed that Wood's entire division would attack, but he realized that his 1,500-man brigade was going to assault unsupported. Hazen glanced at his staff officer Ambrose Bierce who instantly knew that a \"criminal blunder\" was about to happen. All mounted officers sent their horses to the rear and went forward on foot, with Hazen guiding his brigade with a compass because the woods and underbrush were so dense. Hazen's men soon encountered about 1,000 dismounted cavalrymen from the divisions of Brigadier Generals John H. Kelly and William Y. C. Humes.\n\nThe Confederate cavalrymen gamely fought back, but they were deployed in a long skirmish line and Hazen's infantry forced them to give way. Hazen's troops reached a ravine and saw a ridgeline ahead of them about  away. As Hazen's soldiers surged forward to seize the ridge, Granbury's Texas brigade reached the spot ahead of them. Warned that Federals were about to turn his right flank, Cleburne sent Granbury's brigade to help the outmatched cavalrymen. The Texans took cover and opened fire on the approaching Union troops, inflicting many casualties. Some of Hazen's men called out, \"Ah, damn you, we have caught you without your logs\", as they rushed forward. Hazen's men got within  of Granbury's line before they were forced to take cover and return fire. Blocked in front, Hazen swung his second line regiments toward a cornfield on the left. Seeing the cavalrymen on his right getting overpowered, Granbury asked for help from Govan's brigade. Govan sent the consolidated 8th and 19th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, and it drove back some of the Federals who were pressing the cavalry. Next, Cleburne deployed Lowrey's brigade on Granbury's right flank where it repelled more of Hazen's troops. Unfortunately for Hazen and his men, no units from Johnson's division appeared to support his attack.\n\nWith his soldiers taking heavy losses and running low on ammunition, Hazen frantically sent messages to his superiors asking for reinforcements. No help came and neither Wood nor Howard ever explained why. After 50 minutes, the Union survivors spontaneously withdrew; Hazen made no effort to stop them. Finally, with Hazen's attack completely spent, Wood ordered Gibson's brigade forward, thinking that \"a second effort might be more successful\". Gibson's men were stopped by the same intense rifle and artillery fire. Johnson's 1st Division, XIV Corps was made up of the brigades of William Carlin (1st), John H. King (2nd), and Benjamin F. Scribner (3rd). Scribner's brigade finally showed up on Gibson's left, but was quickly pinned down by enfilade rifle fire from Kelly's dismounted cavalrymen. On Gibson's right, McLean's troops displayed no activity, so Key's Arkansas Battery and another artillery unit swung their guns to the right and blasted Gibson's hapless soldiers.\n\n \nCaptain Cyrus Askew of the 15th Ohio Infantry Regiment went to the rear to ask for reinforcements and found Wood and Gibson. After Howard rode up and asked Askew for a report, a shell landed nearby. Howard threw up the stump of his amputated arm and shouted, \"I am afraid to look down\". It turned out that a shell fragment knocked off the heel of Howard's boot, but his foot was not maimed as he feared. Even so, Howard's foot was badly bruised, leaving him unable to walk or ride a horse. Meanwhile, after an hour of futile attempts to capture the ridge, Gibson's troops pulled back. They joined Hazen's men in the rear who were complaining that they had been \"sold out\". At 6 pm, Howard received a message from Thomas, saying that Sherman canceled the attack at 5:15 pm  and ordered him to only defend. Howard ordered Wood to send Knefler's brigade forward to hold the Confederates in check until entrenchments were dug. Knefler's brigade advanced at 6:30 pm and blundered into the ravine where it was struck by intense fire. Pulling back, Knefler's men plus the 37th Indiana and 78th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiments from Scribner's brigade took a position where they exchanged fire with the Confederates until nightfall.\n\nAfter dark, Knefler's men went forward to retrieve as many wounded Union soldiers from the ravine as possible. Among other casualties, Johnson was grazed by a shell and handed command of his division to King. At 10 pm Knefler got the order to pull back, since the defense line was completed. At the same time, Granbury ordered his men to charge into the ravine to drive off any remaining Union soldiers. In the pitch dark, few soldiers were hit by bullets, but Granbury's Texans captured numerous Federals and chased others away. Then Granbury's troops fell back to the ridge. That night, a veteran of many battles from the Texas brigade was assigned to picket duty in the ravine. At dawn, he was so sickened by the carnage that he had to leave. He noted that many of the Federal gunshot victims were struck in the head.\n\nAftermath\n\nCleburne's division reported sustaining 448 casualties, mostly in Granbury's brigade. The Union soldiers suffered a loss of 1,600 killed, wounded, and missing. The American Battlefield Trust estimated losses at 500 Confederate and 1,600 Union. Normally, the killed-to-wounded ratio in Civil War battles was one-to-five. In this battle, the number of killed in Wood's division was extraordinarily high, probably because many of the dead were shot repeatedly. The Confederates found one corpse with 47 bullet holes. Hazen's brigade lost 467 casualties, Gibson's brigade lost 681, and Knefler's brigade lost 250, mainly prisoners. Scribner's brigade lost 125 of which 102 were from the 37th Indiana and 78th Pennsylvania. About 70 wounded and 140 unwounded Union soldiers were captured by the Confederates. Georgia State Parks credited Union forces with 14,000 troops and Confederate forces with 10,000 soldiers.\n\nCox acknowledged that Wood's troops were assailed by fire from Cleburne's division in front, Hindman's division on their right, and cavalry on their left. Even so, Cox believed that if Johnson had ordered Scribner to push straight on, while fending off the Confederate cavalry with another one of his brigades, the attack might have succeeded. Cox admitted that some \"mistake\" prevented McLean's brigade from having any effect. Castel pointed out that a crack Confederate brigade on favorable terrain, supported by two more brigades, dismounted cavalry, and artillery, could be expected to repulse two Union brigades attacking piecemeal.\n\nHascall's division on Schofield's left flank was initially drawn back at an angle. During Wood's attack, Hascall wheeled his division to the right and McLean's brigade was used to fill the gap between Wood's right and Hascall's left. By this time, Sherman thoroughly committed himself to the strategy of moving to his left (northeast) in the direction of the railroad. An added spur to this strategy was the discovery that his soldiers were not getting enough food. Even though the wagon train carried 20 days of food, the sparse road net and the  distance to the Union forward base at Kingston did not allow the food to be distributed to the soldiers efficiently.\n\nHood's corps spent the night of May 27–28 marching to attack Sherman's new left flank. At 6 am on May 28, scouts from Wheeler's cavalry reported that the Federals were waiting behind breastworks, so Johnston called off the attack. That day, Johnston directed Hardee to order Bate's left flank division to probe McPherson's lines to find out if the Union troops were still present. At 3:45 pm, Bate's division and Brigadier General Frank Crawford Armstrong's dismounted cavalry brigade launched an attack on lines manned by Logan's XV Corps. Bate's botched assault in the Battle of Dallas resulted in over 1,000 Confederates getting shot, while Logan admitted only 379 casualties. Ironically, Sherman had ordered McPherson to shift to the left on the night of May 28–29.\n\nAfter various delays, Sherman's shift to the left finally began and on June 1, Stoneman's cavalry occupied Allatoona. This allowed Sherman's railroad crews to proceed with repairing the track. On June 2, Schofield's XXIII Corps pressed forward on the extreme left flank until it encountered Confederate entrenchments near Allatoona Creek. On June 3, Union cavalry under McCook and Stoneman seized Acworth on the railroad. On the same day, Hooker's XX Corps extended Sherman's left flank farther to the left of Schofield. On the night of June 4–5, Johnston abandoned his line of field fortifications based on New Hope Church and retreated to a new line running northeast from Lost Mountain to Pine Mountain to Brushy Mountain. The next major clash occurred at the Battle of Gilgal Church on June 15.\n\nBetween May 23 and June 6, including the fighting at New Hope Church, Pickett's Mill, and Dallas, Sherman's forces suffered 4,500 casualties while Johnston's army lost 3,000. Confederate morale, which sagged after the early May retreats, was uplifted by Johnston's defensive victories. Since the start of the campaign, Sherman's three armies sustained about 12,000 casualties out of a total of 100,000 men, while Johnston's army lost about 9,000 out of an estimated 65,000–75,000 men.\n\nNoted author Ambrose Bierce fought for the Union as a topographical engineer at Pickett's Mill.

The family moved to Kingston in 1958, where he sang in talent contests, including those run by Vere Johns. He was spotted by producer S.L. Smith, for whom he recorded his debut single, \"Guilty Convict\" b/w \"Just Because\", released on Smith's Hi=Lite label nd licensed to Blue Beat Records in 1962.\n\nAfter recording a few further singles, he formed the Ambassadors in 1965 with Paragons singer Junior Menz and guitarist Eric Frater, becoming the Virtues with the addition of Dobby Dobson. They recorded several singles for Harry J, as well as Edwards' first self-production, \"Burning Love\", credited to Rupie Edwards and the Virtues.\n\nThe Virtues broke up in 1968, and Edwards started to focus mainly on his work as a producer, although he continued to release his own records in the late 1960s and early 1970s. By the beginning of the 1970s, he had recorded artists like The Heptones, The Mighty Diamonds, Bob Andy, Johnny Clarke, Joe Higgs, Gregory Isaacs (\"Lonely Man\") and The Ethiopians on his own record labels 'Success' and 'Opportunity', based at his Success record shop in Orange Street, and on the Trojan Records sub-labels Big Records and Cactus. He also worked with DJs such as U-Roy, Dennis Alcapone and I-Roy, and released some instrumental versions with his studio band, The Rupie Edwards All Stars. The group included musicians such as saxophonist Tommy McCook, trombone player Vin Gordon, drummer Carlton 'Santa' Davis, guitarist Hux Brown, pianist Gladstone Anderson, bassist Clifton 'Jackie' Jackson and organist Winston Wright.\n\nIn 1974, he released an album (Yamaha Skank) containing solely of tracks based on the Uniques' \"My Conversation\" riddim, credited as the first single-riddim album. In 1974 and 1975, he scored hits in the UK Singles Chart with \"Ire Feelings\" and \"Leggo Skanga\". Both tracks were based on the same riddim, first used for Johnny Clarke's \"Everyday Wondering\", and the Ire Feelings album followed in 1975. Another one-riddim album based on these tracks, Ire Feelings - Chapter and Version, was released by Trojan in 1990.\n\nAfter these successes, Edwards moved to London, and since then has continued producing and recording, working with artists such as Jah Woosh, Gladstone Anderson, Errol Dunkley, Dobby Dobson, and Shorty the President, and releasing a series of Dub Basket albums culled from his earlier productions. He now mainly records Gospel music.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\nYamaha Skank (1974), Success\nIre Feelings (1975), Cactus\nJamaica Serenade (1976), Cactus\nConversation Stylee (1980), Tad's\nLovers Roots (198?), Success - split with Dobby Dobson\nPleasure and Pain (1987), Success\nSweet Gospel Volume Four, Rupie Edwards\nBible Music Citation (2007), Success\n\nCompilations\nVarious Artists - Rupie's Gems - 1972-1974 (1974), Cactus\nVarious Artists - Yamaha Skank (1974), Success\nRupie Edwards & Various Artists - Hit Picks (1974), Horse\nRupie Edwards All Stars - Dub Basket (1975), Cactus - also issued as Dub Classic (1977), Success\nRupie Edwards All Stars - Dub Basket Chapter 2 (1976), Cactus\nVarious Artists - Rupie's Gems Volume 2 (1976), Cactus\nHit Picks Volume 1 (1977), Success\nVarious Artists - Ire Feelings, Chapter & Version 1973-1975 (1990), Trojan\nRupie Edwards & Friends - Let There Be Version (1990), Trojan\nRupie Edwards All Stars & Various Artists - Pure Gold - Success\nVarious Artists - House of Lovers\nVarious Artists - Rupie's Scorchers - 1969-1971 - Trybute (2002)\nSuccess Archives vols. 1-8 (2006-2007), Success\nBest of Sweet Gospel, Reggae And Soul - Vols. 1 - 7 (2006), Success\nRupie Edwards Presents Success Archives - From Kingston Jamaica to London UK (2013), Rupie Edwards\n\nSee also\nList of Jamaican record producers\nList of reggae musicians\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nEdwards, R.L. \"Rupie\" (2016) Some People, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform,\n\nExternal links\nRupie Edwards Discography from Roots Archives\n\n1945 births\nLiving people\nJamaican record producers\nJamaican reggae musicians\nJamaican male songwriters\nPeople from Saint Ann Parish\nTrojan Records artists"}
{"id": "4107630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/414th%20Expeditionary%20Reconnaissance%20Squadron", "title": "414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron", "text": "The 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron is a provisional United States Air Force unit. It operates the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, last known assigned to the 39th Expeditionary Operations Group, Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. The 39th Expeditionary Operations Group was part of the 39th Air Expeditionary Wing (manned by the 39th Air Base Wing). It controls the launch and landing of the Predator air vehicles. \n\nThe squadron was activated as the 24th Reconnaissance Squadron in February 1942.  Shortly thereafter, it was redesignated as the 414th Bombardment Squadron.  After brief training in the United States with Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft, it was one of the first heavy bomber squadrons to deploy to the European Theater of Operations.  At the end of the year, following Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa, it participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany from the Mediterranean Theater of Operations.  It earned two Distinguished Unit Citations for its actions.  Following V-E Day, it was inactivated in Italy.\n\nThe squadron was converted to provisional status under its current designation in 2011.\n\nMission\nThe squadron's mission is to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance for NATO and Turkey. The squadron uses the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, a remotely piloted aircraft that provides full-motion, high-definition video surveillance.  About fifteen Air Force personnel are stationed at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey to operate the Predators.  Maintenance operations were transferred to a contractor.  The squadron is responsible for the launch and recovery of mission aircraft, acting as the launch and recovery element, while a mission control element operates the Reaper during its mission.\n\nIn 2011 the mission control element was located at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri.\n\nHistory\n\nWorld War II\n\nOrganization and training\nThe squadron was activated at MacDill Field, Florida in February 1942 as the 24th Reconnaissance Squadron, one of the original squadrons of the 97th Bombardment Group.  Since a reorganization of General Headquarters Air Force in September 1936, each bombardment group of the Army Air Forces (AAF) had an assigned or attached reconnaissance squadron, which operated the same aircraft as that group's assigned bombardment squadrons.  The following month, it moved to Sarasota Army Air Field, Florida, where it trained with Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft and also flew antisubmarine patrols.  In April, the practice of having one squadron of heavy bombardment groups designated for reconnaissance ended and the squadron became the 414th Bombardment Squadron.  After a brief training period the squadron left Sarasota on 16 May. \n\nThe ground echelon sailed on the , arriving in Scotland on 10 June and at RAF Grafton Underwood, Northamptonshire, the following day.  The air echelon, along with the air echelon of the 342nd Bombardment Squadron staged through Grenier Field, New Hampshire starting on 15 May. From 2 through 11 June the squadrons deployed elements to the Pacific Coast, recommencing their deployment to Great Britain via Goose Bay Airport, Labrador and Greenland to Prestwick Airport Scotland on 23 June. The squadron's B-17s began arriving at Grafton Underwood on 1 July, where they formed part of the first heavy bomber group assigned to Eighth Air Force.\n\nCombat in Europe\n\nOperations from Great Britain \nThe haste with which the squadron had trained and deployed resulted in deficiencies in its training.  Most pilots had not flown at high altitudes on oxygen; some gunners had never operated a turret, much less fired at a moving target.  Crews had flown together for only a few weeks in training. The squadron's first weeks in England were devoted to intensive training, with numerous specialists attending Royal Air Force (RAF) schools to prepare for combat. The squadron flew its first mission on 17 August 1942, attacking a marshalling yard at Rouen, which was also the first mission flown by AAF heavy bombers stationed in Great Britain. Two days later, the squadron supported Operation Jubilee, the raid on Dieppe, by attacking Abbeville/Drucat Airfield.  It attacked naval installations, airfields and industrial and transportation targets in France and the Low Countries.\n\nIn September, the 97th Group and its squadrons were transferred to XII Bomber Command in the preparations for Operation Torch, the invasion of North Africa.  However, VIII Bomber Command retained operational control of these units until they left England.  The first AAF bomber groups to deploy to England had patterned their basing on that of the RAF Bomber Command, which typically had a wing with two bomber squadrons on a station.  The 414th and 342nd Squadrons were at Grafton Underwood, while the 340th and 341st, along with 97th Group headquarters were at RAF Polebrook.  In September, the AAF decided to follow its own organization and use larger bases that would accommodate an entire group, and the 414th and 342nd Squadrons joined the rest of the group at Polebrook.\n\nOperations in the Mediterranean Theater\n\nFollowing the Operation Torch landings at Oran and Algiers on 8 November, the air echelon of the 414th left Polebrook on 18 November, staging through RAF Hurn for Maison Blanche Airport, Algeria.  The ground echelon sailed by convoy to Algeria.  The squadron was established at Tafaraoui Airfield, Algeria near the end of November.\n\nThrough May 1943, the squadron engaged in the campaign to cut German supply lines in North Africa by striking shipping in the Mediterranean Sea and bombing docks, harbors, airfields and marshalling yards in North Africa, Sardinia, Sicily and southern France and Italy. The squadron moved forward through Algeria and into Tunisia during these operations.  In June 1943, it supported Operation Corkscrew, the projected invasion of Pantelleria, which resulted in the surrender of the island without invasion.  Through the summer of 1943, it supported Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, and Operation Avalanche, the invasion of Italy.\n\nFrom November 1943, the squadron was primarily involved with the strategic bombing campaign against Germany.  The following month, it moved to Italy, pausing at Cerignola Airfield for a month before moving to Amendola Airfield, which would be its station for the remainder of the war.  It bombed targets in Austria, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia; striking strategic targets such as oil refineries, aircraft factories and marshalling yards.  During Big Week, the intensive attacks on the German aircraft industry in February 1944, it was part of the lead formation in a strike on an aircraft manufacturing plant at Steyr, Austria. The group was awarded its first Distinguished Unit Citation for that raid.  It received a second DUC for an attack on the oil refineries near Ploesti, Romania on 18 August 1944.\n\nThe group also flew air support and interdiction missions against enemy lines of communication, airfields and transportation facilities.  It supported Allied forces at Anzio and Monte Cassino.  It supported Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France, with attacks on coastal defenses.  In the spring of 1945, it supported United States Fifth Army and British Eighth Army in their advance through the Po Valley.\n\nFollowing V-E Day, the squadron moved to Marcianise Airfield, Italy, where it was inactivated on 29 October 1945.\n\nExpeditionary operations\nThe squadron was converted to provisional status as the 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron and assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) in the summer of 2011.  USAFE activated it for the first time at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey in the fall.  Its Predators were previously deployed in Iraq, where they flew missions surveilling elements of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which continued from Incirlik. The squadron is made up of airmen deployed from Creech and Holloman Air Force Bases. While in flight, video footage was transmitted to operators at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Squadron operations were limited to reconnaissance until July 2016, when the government of Turkey approved the use of Incirlik to conduct strike missions against ISIS in Syria in Operation Nomad Shadow.  The squadron conducted the first strike against ISIS from Incirlik in support of Operation Inherent Resolve in August.\n\nLineage\n Constituted as the 24th Reconnaissance Squadron (Heavy) on 28 January 1942\n Activated on 3 February 1942\n Redesignated 414th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 22 April 1942\n Redesignated 414th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy 30 September  1944\n Inactivated on 29 October 1945\n Converted to provisional status and redesignated 414th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron on 19 July 2011\n Activated on 15 October 2011\n\nAssignments\n 97th Bombardment Group, 3 February 1942 – 29 October 1945\n United States Air Forces in Europe to activate or inactivate as needed, 19 July 2011\n 39th Expeditionary Operations Group, 15 October 2011 – present\n\nStations\n\n MacDill Field, Florida, 3 February 1942\n Sarasota Army Air Field, Florida, 29 March 1942 – 16 May 1942\n RAF Grafton Underwood (AAF-106), England, 11 June 1942\n RAF Polebrook (AAF-110), England, 8 September 1942 – 10 November 1942\n Maison Blanche Airport, Algeria, c. 19 November 1942\n Tafaraoui Airfield, Algeria, c. 22 November 1942\n Biskra Airfield, Algeria, 26 December 1942\n\n Chateaudun-du-Rhumel Airfield, Algeria, 8 February 1943\n Pont du Fahs Airfield, Tunisia, 12 August 1943\n Depienne Airfield, Tunisia, 14 August 1943\n Cerignola Airfield, Italy, c. 14 December 1943\n Amendola Airfield, Italy, 17 January 1944\n Marcianise Airfield, Italy, c.

Wolf, directed by Tor Ramsey, and executive produced by John A. Russo.\n\nPlot\nSerial killer and serial rapist Abbott Hayes disappears from the morgue and becomes the leader of several waves of zombies that attack his home town. Fourteen years after the last zombie attack, a businessman relocates bodies from a local cemetery to pave the way for progress, but sets in motion Abbott's next undead assault.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nChildren of the Living Dead was produced by John Russo, who had released a colorized version of Night of the Living Dead for its 30th anniversary, which included additional scenes and was colorized. Children of the Living Dead was intended to be a sequel  to this version of the film and shot in Pittsburgh and Ohio with principal photography beginning on July 7, 2000, with a budget of $500,000. The screenplay in the film was written by the daughter of executive producer Joseph Wolf, Karen Lee Wolf who also produced the film. Make-up artist on the film Vincent Guastini described the head zombie in the film, Abbott Hayes, as \"the Nosferatu of zombies\" giving him long fingernails and glowing blue eyes. Along with acting in the film, Savini also coordinated the stunts.\n\nDirector Tor Ramsey felt the production was difficult, with producers Russo and Karen Wolf telling him to cast many of their friends as crew members rather than the people he originally had in mind. Russo stated that when he signed on to it, Joe Wolf was financing the film and stated that Wolf felt his screenplay for the film was great and that he had intentions to direct it. Russo stated that Wolf then came to him saying he wanted to do his daughter's script which Russo described as \"horrible.\" Russo declared that he \"wanted to resign every day but I couldn’t because these people would’ve lost a summer’s worth of work. We hoped for the best and hoped it’d get revised and instead it’s a piece of crap. I call it The Living Abomination of Children.\" In an interview with Tom Savini about his career, he referred to the film as \"the biggest piece-of-shit movie ever made\" and that his lines were dubbed. Savini echoed what Ramsey stating that the \"producer on the show as an idiot. I think her father gave her that movie as a present, and she didn't know what the hell she was doing.\" and that \"the film shouldn't even be on the shelves of video stores.\"\n\nRelease\nChildren of the Living Dead was released directly to video on October 9, 2001, on VHS and DVD by Artisan.\n\nReception\nThe film received negative reviews from critics. Contemporary reviews included, Pete Sankey of Rue Morgue stated the film had no \"blood, no action, nothing impressive at all\" and that the entire film was dubbed and \"it seems as little effort as possible was made to get the sound in sync with the lip movements.\" Sankey concluded that the film was a \"coma-inducing, incomprehensible mess.\" An unnamed reviewer in Fangoria opined that \"It's hard to tell what the primary problem is here: the awful actors, the nickel-and-dime budget or the wretched, childish script; let's call it a three-way tie.\" The reviewer went on to state that Abbott Hayes \"wears what looks like a store-bought Halloween mask and gloves\". A retrospective review from Peter Dendle in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2 had him declared the film as a \"Wretched and hopeless\" finding the film \"dismal, boring, and unnecessarily complicated, all at once.\"\n\nRusso called it the worst film that he had worked on, and said that he often tempted to resign from the production.  Savini has also been dismissive of the film; in an interview, he said that it was originally meant to be a serious horror film but turned out horrible.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n Apology from the director, Tor Ramsey at Homepage Of The Dead\n\n2001 films\n2001 horror films\nAmerican zombie films\nAmerican independent films\nFilms shot in Pittsburgh\nFilms shot in Ohio\nAmerican direct-to-video films\n2000s English-language films\n2000s American films"}

He was born in Løkken Verk which at the time was part of the Meldal municipality.\n\nBiography\nTogether with Amund Sjøbrend, Sten Stensen, and Kay Stenshjemmet, Jan Egil Storholt was one of the legendary four S-es (which sounds like \"four aces\" in Norwegian), four Norwegian top skaters in the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nStorholt grew up in the village of Løkken about  from Trondheim. He became a member of sports club Falken (\"Falcon\") in Trondheim. Falken was the club 1948 Olympic 1,500 m Champion Sverre Farstad and three-time 1952 Olympic Champion (on the 1,500 m, 5000 m, and 10000 m) Hjalmar Andersen had skated for.\n\nStorholt was the Norwegian Junior Champion in 1969, but when he was almost killed in a mining accident in 1970, he was told he would probably not be able to compete at the highest levels again, and it seemed that his promising career had already come to an end. However, Storholt's determination got him back to the Norwegian top by 1972. After some of the best Norwegian speed skaters had turned professional in 1973 (and therefore also could no longer participate in the Olympic Games), Storholt suddenly was one of the best Norwegian amateurs.\n\nIt still took until 1976 for his first major international successes: After having won bronze at the European Allround Championships that year, Storholt went on to win Olympic gold on the 1,500 m in Innsbruck. This made him the third Olympic 1,500 m Champion for sports club Falken. In 1977 he became European Allround Champion and was narrowly defeated by Eric Heiden in the World Allround Championships. He won silver behind Heiden in three consecutive World Championships, and became European Allround Champion for the second time in 1979. This year he won his only Norwegian allround title as a senior.\n\nStorholt ended his speed skating career in 1981, after having won bronze in the World Championships.\n\nMedals\nAn overview of medals won by Storholt at important championships he participated in, listing the years in which he won each:\n\nRecords\n\nWorld records \nOver the course of his career, Storholt skated two world records:\n\nSource: SpeedSkatingStats.com\n\nPersonal records \nTo put these personal records in perspective, the WR column lists the official world records on the dates that Storholt skated his personal records.\n\nNote that Storholt's personal record on the 5,000 m was not a world record because Kay Stenshjemmet skated 6:56.9 at the same tournament.\n\nStorholt was number one on the Adelskalender, the all-time allround speed skating ranking, for a total of 30 days, divided over two short periods in 1977 and 1978. He has an Adelskalender score of 163.042 points.\n\nReferences \n\n Eng, Trond. All Time International Championships, Complete Results: 1889 - 2002.

{"id": "4107663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BCbbecke", "title": "Lübbecke", "text": "Lübbecke (; ) is a town in northeast North Rhine-Westphalia in north Germany. This former county town lies on the northern slopes of the Wiehen Hills (Wiehengebirge) and has around 26,000 inhabitants. The town is part of district of Minden-Lübbecke within the Regierungsbezirk of Detmold in the Ostwestfalen-Lippe region. Lübbecke was first mentioned in the records in 775 as hlidbeki and was given town rights in 1279.\n\nGeography\n\nLübbecke is situated just north of the Wiehen Hills, approx.  north of Herford and  west of Minden.\n\nLocation\nLübbecke is located in northeast North Rhine-Westphalia, north of East Westphalia-Lippe (Ostwestfalen-Lippe), in the southwestern part of the district of Minden-Lübbecke. From a landscape perspective, the town lies in the west of the Minden Land. Geographically, most of the built-up area is on the North German Plain. Only its southern suburbs lie on the northern slope of the Wiehen Hills, whose crest that marks the southern boundary of the borough. The town itself lies on the edge of the hills, whils the rest of the borough is more rural in character. The northern boundary of the borough is defined by the Midland Canal (Mittelland Canal). In the northeast of the borough is the Großes Torfmoor which, together with the Oppenweher Moor, is the largest moor in Westphalia. Between the wet lowlands south of the Mittelland Canal, the glacial valley of the River Weser and the higher ground is a narrow fringe of fertile loess soils at the foot of the Wiehen Hills called the Lübbecker Lößland. The far north of the area is part of the Rahden-Diepenau Geest. In the geest there are only the villages of Stockhausen and Alswede and part of Lübbecke industrial estate.\n\nThe highest hills in Lübbecke's territory are the Heidbrink (320 m), the Wurzelbrink (319 m) and the Kniebrink (315 m). Next to the town itself is the Reineberg (276 m), the Heidkopf (273 m) and the Meesenkopf (226 m). The hills in the south of the borough are the highest in the whole of the Wiehen ridge. In the north the land only attains a height of about 50 m. The lowest point is about 48 m.\n\nWaterbodies\n\nBecause the watershed of the Wiehen Hills forms the southern boundary of the borough, almost the entire territory of Lübbecke is drained towards the north. Only the few hectares of land on the southern slopes of the Wurzelbrink drain towards the south. The Ronceva river flows through the town itself (mostly through pipes) and via the rivers Flöthe and Große Aue to the Weser. The Weser does not cross the borough, however, and even the Große Aue only enters it in the extreme west. The marketed \"mountain spring water\" (Gebirgsquellwasser) is still of great importance for the breweries in Lübbecke.\n\nThe borough of Lübbecke does not have many natural lakes. Both the river channels and the lakes and ponds in the moor are man-made. The largest bodies of water are the Mittelland Canal, with about 50 ha of water surface in Lübbecke's territory, and an unnamed lake in the moor area, which has a contiguous water area of about 9 ha. All other bodies of water have areas under 1 ha. A total of 1.5% of the borough's area (98.2 ha) is covered by water.\n\nGeology and natural resources\n\nGeologically, the surface is mainly covered with unconsolidated rock of the Quaternary period i.e. sand, gravel, loess and glacial till, predominantly from the Pleistocene epoch. In the Wiehen Hills rocks of the Jurassic period, such as sandstone, also occur on the surface.\nOf particular importance, today as in the past, is the recovery of limestone for use as ballast for buildings and roads, and there is a large working quarry in the Wiehen Hills, south of Nettelstedt, where rock is broken and crushed. Numerous small quarries in the Wiehen show that there is a long mining tradition in Lübbecke. Ore appears to have been mined in the hills here for centuries; at Horst Hill there is an old mine gallery. Until the mid 20th century peat was harvested in the Großer Torfmoor, mainly for use in domestic fireplaces. Old transport systems (using tipplers) still existed until a few years ago, when production stopped due to the exhaustion of the deposits and for reasons of nature conservation.\n\nDespite the steep natural gradients, water power cannot be used today because the small catchment area of the mountain streams only delivers small quantities of water. In the past, several water mills worked in the borough. There is a water wheel at the foot of the Wurzelbrink in the village of Eilhausen that can be visited. The use of wind power as a natural resource has recently received a boost. Windmills in places such as Eilhausen show that this energy source has been used since ancient times. The borough's location on the North German Plain favours the use of wind generators, although they are still less cost-effective than other energy generators.\n\nLübbecke is rated almost everywhere as good to very good in terms of its use of geothermal heat sources, especially borehole heat exchangers, and heat production using heat pumps (see the accompanying map).\n\nHistory\n\nThe settlement of Lübbecke was first mentioned in 775 as hlidbeki in the Frankish imperial annals as the site of a Saxon attack on a frankish camp. The town is named after the creek today known as \"Ronceva\" and means little beck in English (Low German: lüt Beek or lüttke Beke, High German: kleiner Bach). Lübbecke was the central site of the Saxon hlidbeki gau. In those days there may already have been a church in hlidbeki that dated back to the Saxon Angrivarii under their duke, Widukind, a tribe who had settled the region during the spread of Christianity under Charlemagne. Lübbecke was the center of an early church parish in the Diocese of Minden, and so the nobility who were native to the area as well as the knightly family in Lübbecke were ministeriales of the bishops of Minden. By 1279 Lübbecke had been given its town charter by the Minden Bishop Volquin of Schwalenberg. The area was also run by the bishops of Minden from the country castle of Reineburg (now Hüllhorst). The lords based there came mainly from the knightly family of Lübbecke. The Burgmann estates in Lübbecke were, in turn, enfeoffed by the castle.  In 1806 twelve of these Burgmann estates were recorded in the borough. The Burgmannen also held a majority on the town council, which met in town hall, first mentioned in 1460.\n\nFrom 1295 Lübbecke became part of a canonical church foundation. This was founded in 1274 in Ahlden an der Aller, but moved in 1280 to Neustadt am Rübenberge and in 1295 to Lübbecke to the St. Andrew's Church. It remained here until it was abolished in 1810. The foundation had 4 estates within the town. In 1549 the diocesan synod was held here under Bishop Franz von Waldeck.\n\nIn 1648 the now secular Principality of Minden (known prior to secularization as the Bishopric of Minden), to which the present borough belonged, went to Brandenburg-Prussia. The town hall burned down in 1705 and was rebuilt in 1709. In 1765 the Prussian government arranged the division of the marks which generated a large portion of the revenue of the town through the allocation of rights and the collection of hunting revenue. Lübbecke's protests against the mark division were unsuccessful.\n\nLübbecke's medieval fortifications were preserved up to the beginning of the 19th century. Due to the high cost of maintenance and their limited military value, the fortifications were razed in 1830 and the material used for construction, the walls being transformed into promenades.\n\nUntil the establishment of the de facto French Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807 and the introduction of French administrative structures, the Burgmann lords remained a major centre of power in Prussian Lübbecke and hindered the development of a patrician class. The middle class merchants were however always represented on the town council by six senatorial seats and provided a civic mayor, who presided over the town jointly with a noble mayor, but the nobility held the reins. The town hall regulations adopted in 1727 by the Prussian government institutionalized this 'diarchy' and envisaged only two senatorial seats. In the Kingdom of Westphalia Lübbecke became the canton capital in the Département du Weser and in the Distrikt of Minden and remained so even when this fell to France in 1811 (from 1811, the Département de l’Ems-Supérieur). In 1813 Lübbecke became Prussian again and, after belonging briefly to the Zivilgouvernement zwischen Weser und Rhine, became part of the Prussian Province of Westphalia. After extensive administrative reforms and the dissolution of the Principality of Minden, Lübbecke became part of the newly created Regierungsbezirk Minden and district of Rahden. In 1832 Lübbecke became the administrative seat of a new district combining Rahden with elements of the district of Bünde, which was renamed into Lübbecke district.\n\nLike almost everywhere in Minden-Ravensberg the textile industry initially emerged in proto-industrial form and, later, was supported by the Prussian state with the construction of the Cologne-Minden Railway and its branch line from Bünde to Rahden, opened in 1899. The cigar industry developed into an important economic factor in Bünde Land and the surrounding towns, including Lübbecke, from about 1860. In 1863 August Blase founded a cigar factory, which had 6,000 employees by 1938. This included employees in its many branches, because just as before in the proto-industrial textile sector, cigars were often cut, rolled and pressed in the home or in stalls. These two branches of the economy - the textile and tobacco industries - are still represented in Lübbecke today, even though their influence now lags behind that of engineering and other industries. In 1907, the last section of the Minden District Railway to Lübbecke opened (running from Minden via Hille to Eickhorst in 1903). In the 1950s, the narrow gauge railway was converted from metre gauge to standard gauge due to the transport of goods. Operations were discontinued in 1974 and the track dismantled between Hille and Lübbecke. In 1912, the first houses were connected to the electrical supply from the Lower Saxon Power Stations. In 1899 the Gasfabrik am Hahlerbaum, a local gas company, was founded; the precursor to today's public utilities. From 1934 Lübbecke had a central water supply.\n\nIn the Second World War, Lübbecke largely escaped attack and was occupied on 3 April 1945 by British troops without great resistance. The nearby town of Bad Oeynhausen became the headquarters of the British forces and British administrative authorities and military staff elements were also housed in Lübbecke. To that end 251 of the 432 houses in Lübbecke were commandeered and cordoned off as accommodation for the Allies. Almost the entire town centre became an exterritorial zone, because all the important administrative buildings of the town's infrastructure went to the British. The finance office on Kaiserstraße was used as the head office of the British Occupation Zone authorities. Even after the foundation of the Federal Republic of West Germany this building remained a base for British military staff, its last use being as the headquarters of the 2nd Armoured Division (Herford being the headquarters of the 1st Armoured Division) before it withdrew in 1983. Up on the hillside above the town was a former Hitler Youth training centre that was also commandeered after the war as Montgomery's headquarters and later became the Officers Mess for HQ 2nd Armoured Division until 1983. After the Division withdrew to the UK the building was renamed Church House and repurposed as a Christian retreat and courses centre as well as a general military conference centre until it closed in 2019 as part of the British Army's withdrawal from Germany.\n\nThe election of the first freely elected town council took place on 17 October 1948.\n\nIn 1973, after the communal reforms of the Bielefeld Act (Bielefeld-Gesetz) the districts of Minden and Lübbecke were merged into the new district of Minden-Lübbecke and the entire district administration was moved to Minden. At the same time the borough of Lübbecke was significantly increased in size by the parishes of Blasheim, Gehlenbeck, Eilhausen and Nettelstedt and the farming community (Bauernschaft) of Alswede.\n\nHistorical population\n\n¹ Census results (measured against the current boundaries)\n\nIncorporations\nBefore the municipal and land reforms that took place on 1 January 1973  the present villages formed their own parishes in Amt Gehlenbeck (Nettelstedt, Eilhausen, Gehlenbeck) or were farming communities (Bauernschaften) attached to parishes (Obermehnen, Blasheim, Stockhausen and Alswede). Obermehnen, Stockhausen as well as the eponymous farming community of Blasheim which belonged to the parish of Blasheim (Amt Preußisch Oldendorf). The community of Alswede gave its name to the parish and district (Amt) of Alswede. These incorporated areas lay almost entirely south of the Mittelland Canal, whereas the parish of Alswede, disbanded on 1 January 1973, and the districts of Amt Gehlenbeck and Amt Alswede spread out a long way to the north. For the northern boundary of the borough of Lübbeck, newly formed in 1973, the Mittelland Canal was chosen, so that the smaller areas of land north of the canal, including those that had belonged to the town of Lübbecke, were transferred to the town of Espelkamp. A bigger reorganisation was needed in the region of the former parish of Alswede. Its territory north of the canal - the villages of Fiestel and Alswede - were separated from the eponymous district of Alswede and incorporated into Espelkamp. Only the village of Alswede lying south of the canal went to Lübbecke. In the south Lübbecke was given part of the Wiehen Hills (Amt Hüllhorst) that used to belong to Ahlsen-Reineberg, namely the Reineberg and the northern slopes of the Heidbrink.\n\nReligion\n\nThe populations has been overwhelmingly Evangelical-Lutheran, since the Prince-Bishopric of Minden accepted the Protestant confession and was secularised in 1648 and, as the Principality of Minden, incorporated into Protestant Prussia. Its Protestant church parishes are the Evangelical-Lutheran parishes in Alswede, Blasheim, Gehlenbeck, Lübbecke and Nettelstedt and the Independent Evangelical-Lutheran parish of St. Peter in Stockhausen and the Evangelical-Free church parish of Lübbecke. The only Roman Catholic parish is the parish of Lübbecke. In addition there are several, other small Christian and non-Christian religious communities.\n\nThe breakdown of religious affiliation is illustrated by the example of schoolchildren in Hüllhorst. Around 72% of the children are Protestant (Evangelical), 6.8% Roman Catholic, and 4.4% Islamic. 7.4% say they belong to other religions and 9.2% don't belong to any religion.\n\nCulture and places of interest\n\nTheatre\nThe Nettelstedt Open Air Stage (Freilichtbühne Nettelstedt) founded in 1923 is an amateur theatre stage with around 900 seats. The Kahle Wart Open Air Stage (Freilichtbühne Kahle Wart) lies right next to the town boundary, albeit on Hüllhorst territory. In the town hall, that has an audience capacity of about 650, there are regular performances and concerts by visiting ensembles.\n\nMusic\nThe numerous trombone bands, such as the Posaunenchor Nettelstedt, grew out of the pietistic trombone bands of the late 19th century and still exist today. In Lübbecke there is a music school and the Jazzclub Lübbecke. St. Andrew's Church has an eponymous choir. In Gehlenbeck a people's choir (Volkschor) was founded in 1922. The idea came from the workers of the numerous cigar factories of that time, who often sang songs at work and wanted to form a society around their pastime.\n\nThe Lübbecke Symphony Orchestra (Sinfonieorchester Lübbecke) was founded in 1950 and celebrated its 60th anniversary during the 2009–2010 concert season. Some of its soloists come from the teaching staff of the Pro Musica music school in Lübbecke.\n\nMuseums\n Barre's Beer World Brewery Museum (Brauereimuseum Barre's Brauwelt): the museum of the town's local brewery, is housed in an old storage cellar and covers the history of the brewery as well as brewing in general.\n Lübbecke Town Museum (Museum der Stadt Lübbecke): A comprehensive collection of traditional costume, a cigar-making collection, a cobbler's workshop and many other exhibits of town history are displayed in the town museum on the market square. The exhibits include coins, weapons, paintings and silver jewellery from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The oldest finds date to the Bronze Age.\n The Gehrmker Hius in Gehlenbeck offers an insight into the village life of bygone years.\n\nBuildings in Lübbecke\n St. Andrew's Church. The church was built from 1160 to 1180 in the Romantic style and converted into a Gothic hall church in 1350.\n The ruins of Reineberg Castle are located on the Reineberg, the local hill of Lübbecke. The site was first mentioned in 1221 in the records and was largely demolished in 1723. Today only the remains of the ramparts and moat are recognisable.\n The Old Town Hall is a cultural and media centre. The building is first recorded in 1460, but was largely rebuilt after a town fire in 1709. It is a two-storey, rendered, solid building with a gable roof. In the rebuilding work carried out in 1861, it was fitted with a neo-Gothic stepped gable. The east wing with its adjoining Fire Service Tower, whose pointed arch, ground floor arcades reflect the shape of the gable, were not added until 1936. In 2006–2007, the building was turned into a cultural and media centre and extended to the rear.\n Residential buildings. Although Lübbecke was largely spared from destruction during the Second World War, its old town no longer has a coherent appearance. Until the middle of the 20th century its streets comprised rows of ordinary, gabled, timber-framed buildings, the majority of which dated to the 18th and 19th centuries. Several of them had bay windows. Not until the redevelopment of the town carried out at the end of the 1960s were there significant losses in the stock of historic houses. The market place (Marktplatz), which was a victim of redevelopment to make way for residential houses and businesses like the Tribbenhof, was particularly badly affected. In 1975, one of the most attractive timber-framed houses in the town, No. 6 Blüttenstraße, with its double-jettied gable, was demolished. Amongst the surviving stone buildings, the house of the industrialist Hecht family, No. 7 Ostertorstrasse, stands out. This classicist plastered building with its central avant-corps was built in 1832 as a restaurant and hotel. Its outside staircase, removed in the 1950s was reconstructed in the 1990s. On Niedertorstraße lies the so-called Old Apothecary (Alte Apotheke). This two-storey, half-timbered building with its mansard roof was built in 1820. Other timber-framed buildings have survived on Langen Straße (Nos. 23, 25, 26 and 44) and in the vicinity of St. Andrew's Church, including the dean's residence, No. 3, Pfarrstraße. On Wilhelmsplatz 1 lies the raised, single-storey Pfarrwitwenhaus (\"priest's widow's house\"), whose history goes back to the 18th century. It was comprehensively restored in 2002 and is now a bed and breakfast inn.\nThe Burgmannshof von der Recke, on Am Markt 19 is a local history museum. The date over the main entrance of this two-storey, rendered solid building with its outside staircase is 1735, but its core is probably older. As well as the manor house (Herrenhaus) a part of the courtyard wall, the gate and the storage barn (Speicher), restored in 1985, have survived.\n Grapendorfs Hof (community centre), Gerichtsstraße 5. Of the former manor that comprised several buildings, only the manor house itself has survived. The core of the house is likely to date to the end of the 16th century. Damaged in the town fire of 1734, the manor was subsequently rebuilt. Today it forms a modest, heptagonal plastered building with a mansard roof, whose outside staircase was removed in recent times for the benefit of traffic. In 1828 the former castellan's residence (Burgmannshof) was bought from the treasury office, in order to use it as the town court. In 1845 and 1846 it was expanded by a wing to the north, also heptagonal in shape, that acted as a district prison. In 1988, after the district court moved to a larger building, the complex was returned to the town which turned it into a citizens’ community centre. This was opened in 1993. The old district court is used nowadays by numerous groups.\nBarre Brewery (Brauerei Barre). The oldest buildings were built shortly after the foundation of the brewery in 1842. The site is dominated by the mash house with its Gothic tower.\n On the second highest hill in the borough, the Wurzelbrink (), is a watchtower built in the 19th century, known as the Wartturm.\n Beer Fountain (Bierbrunnen): The fountain on the Burgmannshof, donated in 1954 by Ernst-Ludwig Barre, dispenses beer once a year during the Beer Fountain Festival (Bierbrunnenfest).\n\nBuildings in the borough\n St. Nicholas' Church in Gehlenbeck was built around 1495. The tower of the Gehlenbeck church is considerably older and was probably erected in the period 1100–1150. There must have been an earlier church by the 10th century, as was indicated by excavations. A church here is first recorded in 1156.\n St. Andrew's Church, Alswede: probably built from the destroyed castle of Mesenburg above Lübbecke.\n Gehrmker Hius: the Gehrmker Hius in its present style is a timber-framed farmhouse from the year 1798. It is used today as a local history house (Heimathaus).\n Königsmühle Eilhausen: this smock mill in Eilhausen was built in 1748 and has a round, sandstone mill tower. The mill has a fantail. The mill is a waypoint on the Westphalian Mill Route.\n Wassermühle Eilhausen: the rubble stone building with timber-framed gables may have been built in 1698. The overshot water wheel has a diameter of 2.6 metres. In the 19th century there were many such mills in Lübbecke. The mill is a waypoint on the Westphalian Mill Route.\n Stockhausen Manor House: The manor house is a water castle in Stockhausen. The origins of this manor house go back to at least the 14th century.\n Stockhausen: Stockhausen is characterised by its rustic farmsteads with their timber framing typical of the regional and their associated hireling cottages. It has 19 listed buildings. Farmyard oaks, mixed orchard meadows and cottage gardens reinforce the countryside feeling. In the competition \"Our Village Should Become More Beautiful\" (Unser Dorf soll schöner werden) Stockhausen was awarded gold several times in 1995. In 1997 Stockhausen was designated one of four \"model cultural villages\" (Kulturmusterdörfern) in Ostwestfalen-Lippe.\n Renkhausen Manor House: the neo-Renaissance style manor house was founded on the walls of an old water castle that was first mentioned in 1278.\n Obernfelde Manor House: the former knight's estate and manor house was first mentioned in 1540.\n Eickel Manor House: formerly called Echolte Manor House, it is located near Blasheim. A reference to a knight called Eylwast of Echolte suggests that the manor house may well have existed before 1183. Formerly there was a Groß-Eickel Manor House and a Klein-Eickel Manor House. These two estates were however merged at the start of the 18th century.\n Babilonie: the La Tène culture hillfort lies on a hill in the Wiehen near Obermehnen and could have been a refuge castle.\n Meesenburg: only the ruins of this fortification on the Meesenkopf hill have survived. It was probably slighted in the 12th century.\n\nParks\nAs a small town situated between moorland and forest, Lübbecke has no need for expansive parks in the classic sense. Just 10 to 15 minutes walk away from Lübbecke are the Wiehen Hills and TERRA.vita Nature Park. Lübbecke's townsfolk have the Gallenkamp, a park-like, elevated open space in the immediate vicinity of the town centre. From here there is a splendid view over the Lübbecker Land. In winter the Gallenkamp is used by Lübbecke's youth for tobogganing.\nThere is also a long strip of parkland in the area of Schützenstraße.\nAnother large, local area of grassland with walks is located between the cemetery and the Wittekind Grammar School (Wittekind-Gymnasium).\nSignificantly, all the aforementioned parks and open spaces are within range of the more select residential areas, which are anyway in the immediate vicinity of the Wiehen Hills.\n\nOutside the town itself the majority of parks are in the grounds of manor houses and castles. These include the following parks none of which are open to the public:\n Stockhausen Manor Park: Little remains of the former Baroque gardens. An avenue of chestnuts, around 200 years old, runs from north to south from the manor house to the Recke family graveyard and was once an element of the gardens.\n Renkhausen Manor Park: The landscape gardens of the manor house were laid out around 1900. A central element is the open area of lawn, which is studded with old trees. An artificial hill and a grotto also form part of the gardens. A 100-year-old Renkhausen lime avenue runs eastwards from the manor house.\n Obernfelde Manor Park: The manor park was probably laid out together with the orangery, built in 1829 and now a residence. The orangery forms the centrepiece of a historic landscape park with a relatively extensive system of paths and avenues. Of the original park only a few elements south of the orangery remain.\n\nNature\nThat part of the Wiehen Hills in the borough of Lübbecke is also part of the TERRA.vita Nature Park (formerly the North Teutoburg Forest-Wiehen Hills Nature Park). There are also six nature reserves in the borough:\n Bastauwiesen: 1,844 ha of protected wet meadows along the Bastau. Large parts of the area lie in Hille and the borough of Minden.\n Finkenburg: 13 ha area in Blasheim.\n Gehlenbecker Masch: 45 ha of wet meadows\n Großes Torfmoor: Westphalia's biggest raised bog (Hochmoor). The 467 ha nature reserve lies partly in Hille.\n Rauhe Horst – Schäferwiesen: 198 ha of water meadows and wet grassland.\n Sonnenwinkel: 4.3 ha of deciduous forest\n\nThe ratio of designated nature reserve land in Lübbecke is over 10 per cent and thus significantly greater than that in the state (7.3 per cent) and the Federation (2 per cent). This high value is all the more surprising because the near-natural Wiehen Hills, apart from the Sonnenwinkel are not a formally designated nature reserve.\n\nThe wildlife in Lübbecke includes the following large animals in the near-natural forested and moorland areas: wild boar and roe deer, fox, badger especially in the Wiehen, but also on cultivated land. In the moorland areas there are white stork, and the poisonous viper. Lübbecke is one of only two places, the other being nearby Petershagen, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia where wild white storks still breed.\nIn the area south of the town is the largest colony of bats; often seen over the gardens on summer evenings.\n\nFive groups of trees or isolated trees near Lübbecke and in the village of Gehlenbeck have been designated as natural monuments.\n\nThere are serious discussions that Lübbecke, possibly in cooperation with the neighbouring town of Espelkamp, will apply to stage the state garden show in 2017.\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\n\nLübbecke is twinned with:\n Bayeux, France (1968)\n Dorchester, England, United Kingdom (1973)\n Tiszakécske, Hungary (1989)\n Bad Liebenwerda, Germany (1990)\n\nSport\nThe team handball club TuS Nettelstedt-Lübbecke is at home in Lübbecke. The club currently competes in the German First League of Handball.\n\nEducation\n\nSchools\n Wittekind Gymnasium Lübbecke\n Stadtschule Lübbecke\n Pestalozzi School\n Berufskolleg Lübbecke\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website \n\n \nMinden-Lübbecke\nWiehen Hills"}

The Union forces, led by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, encountered the Confederate Army of Tennessee, led by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, entrenched near Marietta, Georgia.\n\nBattles\n\nSeveral engagements were fought during this four-week period, including the battles of Pine Mountain (June 14), Gilgal Church (June 15), Kolb's Farm (June 22), and Kennesaw Mountain (June 27). Sherman forced Johnston to withdraw partially on June 18 to protect his supply lines, but the Union forces were not fully victorious until July 3.\n\nDeath of Lieutenant General Polk\nOn June 14, 1864, Confederate General Leonidas Polk, second cousin of former United States president James K. Polk was scouting enemy positions near Marietta, Georgia with his staff when he was killed in action by a Federal  shell at Pine Mountain. The artillery fire was initiated when Sherman spotted a cluster of Confederate officers—Polk, William J. Hardee, Johnston, and their staffs—in an exposed area. He pointed them out to Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, commander of the IV Corps, and ordered him to fire on them. The 5th Indiana Battery, commanded by Capt. Peter Simonson, obeyed the order within minutes. The first round came close and a second even closer, causing the men to disperse. The third shell struck Polk's left arm, went through the chest, and exited hitting his right arm then exploded against a tree, cutting Polk nearly in two.\n\nReferences\n \n\n CWSAC Report Update and Resurvey: Individual Battlefield Profiles\n\nExternal links\n Battle of Gilgal Church\n\nMarietta\nMarietta\nMarietta\nMarietta\nLeonidas Polk\nMarietta\n1864 in Georgia (U.S. state)\nJune 1864 events\nJuly 1864 events"}

{"id": "4107689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle%20Mountain%20Railroad", "title": "Eagle Mountain Railroad", "text": "The Eagle Mountain Railroad (EMRR) was a private railroad in California, owned by the Kaiser Steel Corporation, and is owned today by Kaiser Steel's successor, Kaiser Ventures, Inc. of Ontario, California. \n\nThe EMRR is  long and is located in Riverside County, California.  Constructed in 1947–1948, it was used until 1986 to haul iron ore from Kaiser's Eagle Mountain Mine in the Colorado Desert to an interchange with the Southern Pacific Transportation Company in the Coachella Valley.  The last revenue train to operate over the line was on March 24, 1986.\n\nRoute\n\nThe Eagle Mountain Railroad starts at a remote location called \"Ferrum\" (Latin for iron) which is located adjacent to the Salton Sea in Riverside County, and terminates  away at the Eagle Mountain Mine (also known as Iron Chief Mine).\n\nFerrum was the location of a five track yard that was used to interchange with the Southern Pacific Railroad.  Also located at Ferrum is a wye (not disconnected) and maintenance equipment shed.  The interchange yard parallels the present-day Union Pacific Railroad Yuma Subdivision main line, the main transcontinental railroad line between California and Texas.  The main track heading to Eagle Mountain starts at the east end of the yard.\n\nUpon leaving the Ferrum interchange yard, the track immediately climbs a hill, then descends to a wooden trestle.  The track then heads east over mudflats while ascending a grade. There is a wooden trestle over Dos Palmas Wash.  The track crosses over the rebuilt Coachella Canal.  The canal passes under the track in a concrete siphon.  The track crosses the abandoned original channel of the Coachella Canal on a three span steel bridge.  While the bridge remains, water no longer flows beneath.\n\nThe tracks continue climbing the mudflats east where they turn north on a sweeping curve.  Continuing north, the tracks cross the Bradshaw Trail before passing through a small cut and entering the first of two horseshoe curves.  After this horseshoe curve, the tracks run east along the foothills of the Chocolate Mountains while the Salt Creek Wash parallels the tracks on the south side.\n\nAfter curving along the Chocolate Mountains for two miles (3 km), the tracks turn south and cross the Salt Creek Wash on the railroad's longest bridge.  The \"Salt Creek Wash Bridge\" is  long and  high.  The original bridge located here was a wooden trestle. After a fire destroyed that bridge an all-steel bridge was constructed.  After the bridge, the track enters the second or upper horseshoe curve.  At the start of the horseshoe curve, the track is located on a high fill; by the end of the curve, the track is located in a deep cut.\n\nThe tracks head northeast with the Salt Creek Wash paralleling the line on the north side.  The tracks cross numerous small washes with either small wooden bridges or cast iron culverts allowing water to pass.  At Milepost 20, the uphill grade remained at a constant 2.0% ever since before Milepost 4.\n\nThe railroad reaches the top of the long climb from Ferrum at \"Summit\", which is located at Milepost 25.  A  long passing siding and a short storage spur are located here.  A maintenance shed is also located here.\n\nAfter Summit, the track begins a long down hill run that will go almost the entire way to Eagle Mountain.  Just past Summit, the tracks turn north and head towards Interstate 10.  Just prior to crossing under Interstate 10, there are three small maintenance sheds.  The \"Interstate 10 Underpass\" is located at the Red Cloud Road Exit.  After the underpass, the tracks curve east and start running along the foothills of the Eagle Mountains.  At Milepost 35.8 is \"Entrance\", the location of a short  storage track.  Shortly after Entrance, the tracks curve north again and head for the Victory Hills.  Just before arriving at the Victory Hills, the tracks cross Eagle Mountain Road, the original access road to the mine.  This is the first paved road (other than Interstate 10) that the railroad has crossed.\n\nThe Victory Hills are a chain of small hills that run east of the Eagle Mountains and provide a minor obstacle to the railroad.  The railroad passes through these through a deep cut in the low part between two hills.  After crossing Eagle Mountain Road for a second time, the tracks arrive at \"Telephone Pass\". The railroad today passes between the same two mountains.  Telephone Pass is the end of the downhill grade from Summit and for here to the mine is all uphill.\n\nThe uphill climb from Telephone Pass to the Eagle Mountain Mine is called \"Caution Hill\" and is so named because its 2.15% grade is the steepest on the line and descending it with a loaded ore train required great caution.  It got its name after a loaded train ran away here in the early days of the railroad.  All loaded ore trains descending Caution Hill were restricted to  and were required to come to a complete stop at the bottom for 5 minutes to cool their brakes before proceeding.  During the climb up to Eagle Mountain, the tracks cross Eagle Mountain Road for a third time and then cross Aqueduct Road.  Immediately after Aqueduct Road, the railroad crosses an underground section of the Colorado River Aqueduct.  Fears that vibrations from the heavy trains would damage the underground concrete aqueduct, the railroad crosses the aqueduct on a  steel bridge.  While this bridge appears to cross over nothing since the desert sand covering the aqueduct covers the lower part of the bridge, its serves a vital function.  As the tracks approach Eagle Mountain, they cross Eagle Mountain Road for the fourth and final time before looping around the base of the mountains and arriving at the Eagle Mountain Mine.\n\n\"Eagle Mountain Mine\" is located at Milepost 51.0 with the end of track located at Milepost 51.3.  There are four long tracks used in the loading ore process located here, along with a two track maintenance shop, a wye, and a few storage tracks.  All the railroad facilities are located immediately west of the Eagle Mountain townsite.\n\nTraffic\n Iron ore\n Mining equipment and supplies\n\nHistory\nKaiser Steel Corporation was incorporated on December 1, 1941, for the purpose of manufacturing steel in Southern California.  The finished steel was needed to supply the various shipbuilding facilities controlled by Henry J. Kaiser on the west coast.  These facilities were building ships for the British government and were using costly eastern steel that was in short supply.  After obtaining the $125 million needed, construction of the mill in Fontana, California, began.  In August 1943, the first plate steel rolled off the production line there.\n\nCoal for this early production came from Utah Fuel Company Mine No. 2 at Sunnyside, Utah, and was transported to the mill via the Union Pacific Railroad.  In 1950, Kaiser Steel purchased the entire Sunnyside, Utah facility.  In 1955, Kaiser purchased  of land near Raton, New Mexico, for future expanded coal production.  The existing mine at this Raton location, named the Koehler Mine, was operated and upgraded until a newer and more modern mine could be completed.  This new mine, named York Canyon Mine, served as the major source of coking coal until the Fontana Mill closed in 1983.\n\nAlso needed for the production of steel was limestone.  Until 1955, this material was purchased from various sources in California and Nevada.  In that year Kaiser Steel purchased a large deposit located at Cushenbury, California,  from the Fontana Mill.  The limestone was transported to the Fontana Mill by the Santa Fe Railway.\n\nThe last ingredient needed for the steelmaking process was a reliable source of iron ore.  Kaiser Steel purchased the Vulcan Mine located near Kelso, California, which served as the primary source of ore until 1948.  The Union Pacific Railroad transported the iron ore from Kelso to the Fontana Mill.  This ore was not of sufficient quality to satisfy Kaiser, and a better source was sought.  In 1944 Kaiser Steel purchased the Eagle Mountain mining claim from the Southern Pacific Railroad and began development of the Eagle Mountain Mine after the end of World War II.\n\nConstruction and operation\nConstruction of  long Eagle Mountain Railroad began in August 1947.  This included  of main line from Ferrum Junction (changed in 1956 to just Ferrum) to the mine yard and another two miles (3 km) of mine trackage.  This was one of the longest privately built standard gauge railroads constructed in the American Southwest in the post World War II era.  The line was completed on July 29, 1948, at a cost of $3.2 million.  In August 1948 the first carloads of raw iron ore rolled over the newly-laid rails.\n\nThe railroad was originally constructed with 110-pound per yard jointed rail laid on wooden crossties.  Later welded rail was tried but difficulties in retrieving this rail after flooding resulted in the railroad switching back to jointed rail.  By 1980, 119-pound per yard rail was used in tangent sections while heavier 136-pound per yard rail was used in the majority of the curves.\n\nDuring early operations, ore was loaded into Southern Pacific gondola and open-top hopper cars of 50-, 60- and 70-ton capacity.  Starting in 1958, these cars were replaced by about 700 closed-bottom 100-ton ore cars.  These cars were constructed by Southern Pacific at its Sacramento, California, shops.  During the 1960s, these cars were modified to give them increased height, needed to carry pelletized ore (which was less dense) and this increased car loadings to 108 tons.  From the early 1960s until the early 1970s, two loaded 100-car trains left the mine each day, seven days a week.  One train carried the iron ore needed for the Fontana Mill while the second train handled ore to Long Beach, California, where it was shipped to oversea steel mills.\n\nFrom the early 1970s until the early 1980s, one 100-car train was dispatched to the Fontana Mill each and every day.  By 1982, operations varied from three to five trains per week, with as few as 40 carloads per train.  After a short suspension of operations in early 1985, trains were run once a week until the complete discontinuance of operation in March 1986.\n\nLoading ore\nLoading the railcars with the processed iron ore at Eagle Mountain was fairly simple and required no locomotives to be used.  An arriving train of up to 101 empty ore cars would be placed on one of two \"incline\" tracks.  These incline tracks were specifically laid out so that the end of the track furthest from the ore loading tower would be the track's highest point and would gradually drop downgrade to the ore loading tower.  When loading operations started, four cars at a time were cut off from the empty ore train and allowed to roll downhill the short distance to the loading tower where they were loaded, two cars at a time.\n\nOnce four cars were loaded, they were allowed to roll downhill to a special section of track called the \"Reverser Track\".  As the cars rolled onto the Reverser Track, they would immediately start rolling uphill until they came to a stop and started rolling backward.  They would then pass over a spring-loaded switch that would send the four loaded cars to one of two \"saucer\" tracks.  These tracks were laid with the curvature of a saucer, with each end higher than middle.  The cars would roll into the saucer track and settle at the bottom.  When the next four loaded cars arrived, they would couple to the cars already there without damaging the cars and the entire line of cars would be evenly settled on the saucer track.\n\nMovies\nIn January–February 1966, Columbia Pictures filmed many scenes for the motion picture The Professionals on the railroad.  This action western starred Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan, Woody Strode, Jack Palance and Claudia Cardinale.  The basic story involved four men, each with unique talents, being hired by a millionaire to rescue his wife, who was kidnapped by a Mexican bandit.  The movie makes extensive use of ex-Great Western steam locomotive No. 75, which stands in for both an American and Mexican locomotive.  The scenes where the four men cross the border at a wooden bridge is actually the first railroad bridge north of Ferrum.  The large steel bridge over the Salt Creek Wash was actually repainted to appear as a wooden bridge since the movie is set around 1910.  Other scenes were shot at Gravel Pit and Summit.  An ex-Southern Pacific caboose and a couple old wooden boxcars were used along with a Kaiser Steel flatcar for the various trains seen in the movie.\n\nIn March–April 1986, Touchstones Films, a Walt Disney subsidiary, filmed the movie Tough Guys on a portion of the railroad.  This comedy starred Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Eli Wallach and Dana Carvey.  It was the final collaboration for Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas.  They play a pair of train robbers that have been released from prison after 30 years.  Unable to survive in a changed world, they decide to rob the same train that they robbed 30 years ago.  At the end of the film, they hijack the \"Gold Coast Flyer\" pulled by famed locomotive Southern Pacific 4449, and run it full throttle to the Mexican border.\n\nThe special train used in the film consisted of Southern Pacific 4449, its auxiliary water car, and four passenger cars.  It departed its home base in Portland, Oregon, on March 5 and arrived in Los Angeles on March 9.  Over the next four days, the interior of one passenger car was redone by Touchstone crews since it would appear in one scene.  In addition, two Southern Pacific flatcars were added to the train and a mockup of the 4449's cab was placed on one of them.  This mockup was used for some cab shots, since it is easier to move the camera around in it than in the real thing.  Over the eight days between March 14 and March 21, several scenes were filmed at Southern Pacific's Taylor Yard.\n\nOn March 31, 1986, the seven car special train departed Los Angeles at 10:00am and arrived on the Eagle Mountain Railroad at Ferrum around 6:00pm.  About one hour later it arrived at the movie set that had been constructed at Summit.  The train spent the night here.  The next day, April 1, the Southern Pacific 4449 along with one passenger car and its auxiliary water tender headed for Eagle Mountain for water.  After filling up with water, the shortened train returned to Summit.  The following day, April 2, saw the start of nine days of filming on the railroad.  Scenes were shot between the Coachella Canal Bridge and Summit.  Shooting these scenes required numerous run-bys and hours of waiting.  During the last few days of filming, the water supply on board the locomotive started to run low, so a pair of Kaiser Steel U30C's picked up the auxiliary water tender, took it to Eagle Mountain where it was refilled with water and then returned to Summit later in the day.  During the filming, the local school children from Eagle Mountain Elementary School took a field trip to see and tour the train and movie set, with miniatures, at Summit.  Filming wrapped up on April 10, and that afternoon the train headed to Eagle Mountain for servicing.  The next day, April 11, the special train backed all the way to Ferrum where the train is turned around before heading to Colton, California.  The special train arrived back in Portland on April 16.\n\n(Near the end of the movie, it appears that 4449 runs off the end of the track into the dirt, then the actors emerge from the cab.  This was done using another full-sized fiberglass/wood mockup, this time of both the engine and tender.  This mockup can still be seen through the windows of a garage building adjacent to the cafe in Desert Center, CA.)\n\nClosure\nIn the late 1970s increased environmental concerns at the Fontana Mill and stiff foreign competition resulted in decreased demand for Kaiser Steel products and thus resulted in a reduction of output at the Eagle Mountain Mine.  This dropped the population at Eagle Mountain to a low of 1,890 residents.  In Summer 1980, the mine shutdown briefly, reopening on September 23.  Only 750 workers were brought back to the town with 150 on furlough.\n\nOn November 3, 1981, Kaiser Steel announced the phasing out of half the Fontana Mill and the closure of the entire Eagle Mountain Mine over the next few years.  The population dwindled as layoffs began.  The grocery store closed in October, 1982 and the post office, which had been active since 1951, closed in January, 1983.  In June 1983, the last official graduating class celebrated their commencement at Eagle Mountain High School, followed by closing of both the mine and mill a few months later.\n\nThe Eagle Mountain Railroad saw a reduction on operations that mirrored the reduced production at the mine.  During the early 1980s, the railroad was only operating a single ore train three to five times per week, with each train consisting of as little as 40 cars.  When the mine closed in 1983, the railroad was barely operating three trains per week.\n\nWhile the Eagle Mountain Mine had stopped all mining activity in 1983, they still had a significant stockpile of processed iron ore sitting on the ground in Eagle Mountain.  It was decided to ship this product out since it was high-quality concentrated iron-ore, which is very valuable.  The railroad operated two trains per week from mid-1983 until early 1985 when operations shutdown for a brief time.  When operations resumed, they only operated a single train per week, usually 50 to 60 cars in length.  When the stockpiled ore was gone, the railroad shut down.  The last ore train operated on March 24, 1986, when 20 cars of ore where shipped out.  Once filming of the Tough Guys movie was completed, the last two remaining locomotives were sent to the Fontana Mill.\n\nRedevelopment\n\nCorrectional facility\nShortly after the last iron ore had been shipped out in 1986, the California Department of Corrections proposed placing a privately operated prison for low-risk inmates at Eagle Mountain.  In 1988, Management and Training Corporation, an operator of several private-run prisons, converted the old shopping center into just such a facility. State budget problems and a fatal riot led to the closure of the prison on December 31, 2003. Although there were talks to reopen the facility in 2005, no agreement was reached to do so.\n\nWaste site\nDuring 1988, a proposal was made to turn one of the gigantic 1.5-mile-long (2.4 km) by half-mile-wide (800 m) mining pits into a massive, high-tech sanitary landfill.  The landfill, to be operated by a partnership of two privately operated trash collection firms and the successor to Kaiser Steel, Kaiser Ventures, would ship trash by train from metropolitan Los Angeles area via the Eagle Mountain Railroad.  The Riverside County Board of Supervisors approved the project in October 1992 after EPA approval of the project.  Due to numerous lawsuits regarding the environmental effects of the landfill, the project was repeatedly delayed.  The private partnership decided in late 1999 to give up on the project.  Their share of the project was bought out by Kaiser Ventures, making it controlling owner of the project.\n\nIn August 2000, Kaiser Ventures reached an agreement with the Los Angeles Sanitation Districts, a public entity consisting of several Los Angeles public waste collection agencies, to purchase the landfill project to replace their Puente Hills Landfill, which would be nearing the end of its useful life.  However, since the sale agreement states that all lawsuits and claims regarding the project must be resolved, the transaction never began.  As of 2009, there was only one lawsuit still pending but in November 2009, Kaiser Ventures received a disappointing ruling from the Federal Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit regarding this lawsuit.  This ruling was a major setback for the project and ultimately Kaiser Ventures decided to abandon the project.\n\nHowever, the solid waste disposal market has changed significantly since the Eagle Mountain landfill was first proposed.  There has been a substantial reduction in the waste generated due to recycling efforts and an increase in low-cost traditional disposal sites (most notably in nearby Orange County), eliminating the need for remote solid waste landfills such as the Eagle Mountain landfill.  The reduction in waste generated has been so great that the other landfill site owned by the Los Angeles Sanitation Districts, the Mesquite Regional Landfill near Glamis, will not be needed until 2030 at the earliest even though all construction of this facility has been completed and it could immediately start accepting trash.\n\nMaintenance & mothballing\nThe railroad remained relatively untouched since the last ore train operated in 1986.  However, the large ore loading tower at Eagle Mountain was removed in 1990.  Kaiser Ventures conducted maintenance work and routine repairs to the rail line in the mid-1990s.  To accomplish this, a single switcher locomotive (painted for Kaiser Ventures) was brought to the property to operate small work trains.  When this work was completed, the locomotive was stored at Eagle Mountain for a short time before being moved to the old Fontana Mill site where it remained stored.\n\nIn August and September 2003, approximately  of track were damaged when two flash floods hit the railroad.  In several locations, culverts were washed out leaving track suspended in the air although no significant structures were damaged as all bridges held up well to the flood waters.  In other locations, silt up to  deep covers the tracks.  Kaiser Ventures estimated it would cost about $3.5 million to repair the damage.  During the next two years, a contractor conducted work along the entire line to culverts and protective diversion dikes to prevent any further damage but the damaged sections remained as Kaiser Ventures decided to postpone repairs until a future date when funds would be available.\n\nTrack removal\nThe entire interchange yard in Ferrum was removed by the Union Pacific during a track expansion project.  All that remains is part of the wye and an old maintenance-of-way structure.  The railroad's mainline appears to still be mostly intact.  In April 2017, a railroad materials company began removing the track by working its way from Eagle Mountain to Ferrum. By 2023 removal will be completed.\n\nRolling stock\n\nLocomotives\nThe first locomotives used by Kaiser Steel on the Eagle Mountain Railroad were a pair of Baldwin Locomotive Works DRS6-6-15 diesels numbered 1010A and 1010B.  They were constructed in June 1948 and delivered to the railroad in August 1948.  They were Builder Numbers 73749 and 74451.  They had .\n\nAs production at the mine increased, the railroad purchased two more locomotives from Baldwin.  These were AS616s and were numbered 1012A and 1012B.  They were constructed in early 1951 and delivered to the railroad in June 1952.  They were Builder Numbers 75356 and 75357.  They had .\n\nIn 1958, with production continuing to increase, the railroad purchased another Baldwin AS616 from a second-hand locomotive dealer.  This locomotive was built in November 1950 and delivered to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) in December 1950 as their No. 5533.  It has Builder Number 74917 and also had .  It was sold by C&O to Pan American Engineering in Dallas, Texas in January 1958 and resold to Kaiser Steel later that year.  It was assigned No. 1020 by Kaiser Steel.\n\nIn 1966 and 1967, all locomotives were renumbered by Kaiser Steel.  1010A and 1010B become 1025 and 1026 respectively while 1012A and 1012B becoming 1027 and 1028.  Locomotive 1020 become 1029.\n\nThese five Baldwin locomotives were being used on a daily basis and all five were required to move a single train from the Eagle Mountain Mine to the interchange at Ferrum.  By 1968, these locomotives were at the end of their useful lives and were constantly breaking down.  The railroad was leasing two additional Baldwin AS616's from Southern Pacific, but still couldn't keep five locomotives running on a regular basis.  This required the railroad \"double\" the train, which is a costly and time-consuming procedure.  By 1968, the railroad decided it was time to purchase new locomotives.\n\nIn 1968, Kaiser Steel purchased five new General Electric U30C locomotives.  These were numbered 1030 through 1034.  The first three were constructed in March 1968 and the other two in April 1968.  All five were delivered to the railroad in late April 1968.  They were Builder Numbers 36762 through 36766.  They have .  They were built to Southern Pacific specifications since they were built from five production slots from an existing Southern Pacific order.\n\nThe five original locomotives were kept as spare locomotives until 1971 when they were either sold or transferred to other Kaiser operations.  Locomotives 1025 and 1026 were sold in March 1972 to Railway Supply Company of Montgomery, Alabama.  There they were rebuilt for Peabody Coal Company for use at its River King Mine in Marrisa, Illinois.  1025 was later sold for scrap to Hyman-Michaels in Alton, Illinois and was scrapped in August 1978.  1026 was sold in August 1978 to Koppel Bulk Terminal at Long Beach, California.  It was then sold in early 1980 to Chrome Cranshaft in Alhambra, California and was scrapped in late 1980.\n\nLocomotives 1027 and 1029 were sent to Pan American Engineering in 1971 for repairs.  They were then sent to Kaiser Bauxite in Discovery Bay, Jamaica where they became 5108 and 5107 respectively.  As of 2008, reports from railfans indicate they are still there, but long out-of-service.\n\nLocomotive 1028 was sold in 1971 to Rayonier, Inc. at Grays Harbor, Washington, where it was numbered 14.  It was then sold in late 1985 to Trona Railway in Trona, California, where it became No. 54, entering service in late 1986.  In late 1992 it was sold to Johnston Terminal in Enid, Oklahoma.  It was then sold in July 1995 to SMS Rail Service in New Jersey and given the number 554.  As of 2008, it was still in service at SMS Rail Service, assigned to the Pureland Industrial Complex in Bridgeport, New Jersey.\n\nThe five GE U30C locomotives worked on the Eagle Mountain Railroad from 1968 to April 1986.  Most of the time, four were assigned to the daily iron-ore trains, while the fifth locomotive would be used as a spare or be cycled through the Southern Pacific's Taylor Shops for routine maintenance and repairs.  When the mine shutdown in 1983, the railroad continued operating, hauling out the stockpiled iron ore.  When the stockpile ran out, the locomotives were sent to the Fontana Mill for storage.  The last three locomotives left the property on April 8, 1986.  All five locomotives remained in storage at the Fontana Mill until 1995 when they were scrapped.\n\nCabooses\n\nKaiser Steel had two home-built cabooses it used on the Eagle Mountain Railroad.  The first caboose was KS 1905 and was constructed at the Fontana Mill in 1948.  The second caboose was KS 1918 and was constructed at the Fontana Mill in 1953.  Both cabooses were similar to those used on the Southern Pacific Railroad at that time.  Both were bay-window style with ASF Andrew-type four wheel trucks, National coiled spring bearings, and used Kaiser ship-type welded steel plate construction.  They had swamp cooler air-conditioning and unusually wide bay windows.  The windows in KS 1905 were slightly larger than those on KS 1918.\n\nBoth cabooses were used on a regular basis and one caboose was always at the rear of loaded ore trains from Eagle Mountain to Ferrum and just behind the locomotives on the return trips to Eagle Mountain.  When the railroad reduced operations from two to one round trip ore train per day, KS 1905 become the only caboose used and KS 1918 was stored at Ferrum, where it was severely vandalized.\n\nIn June 1975, KS 1905 received severe frame damage in a switching accident at Eagle Mountain.  The maintenance shop at Eagle Mountain started repairs on KS 1905 but it was quickly halted once the damage was determined to be too extensive.  At this point, KS 1918 was moved to Eagle Mountain and rebuilt by the maintenance shop.  Renumbered as the \"new\" KS 1905, its metal toolbox and wire alternator cage are from the \"original\" KS 1905.  The rebuilding gave the \"new\" KS 1905 rubbered molding windows, axle belt-driven alternator, ice box, new water tank, and an air-flush commode.  It was painted red with white Kaiser Steel lettering and numbers on the side.  The \"new\" KS 1905 was used on the ore trains until 1983 when trains started operating without cabooses.\n\nThe \"old\" KS 1905 was stored at Eagle Mountain until 1983.  Since its aborted rebuilding had left it nothing but a steel shell on railroad wheels, it was sold and was on display at Ragsdale's Desert Center Cafe in Desert Center, California, about  south of Eagle Mountain.  As of April 2009, it was still there. In November 2019, it was sold via auction for $7,500 to an unknown buyer. The \"new\" KS 1905 was donated by Kaiser Steel to the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum Association (PSRMA) in June 1984.  On January 28, 1985, it was taken to Campo, California by truck since the railroad wasn't operating at the time.  Now on display in operating condition, the \"new\" KS 1905 is the San Diego Railway Museum's primary work-train caboose due to its sturdiness, excellent visibility and air conditioning.  It has even carried revenue passengers on occasion.\n\nNotes\n Eagle Mountain is the birthplace of Kaiser Permanente Health Care.  It was at this industrial mining town that Kaiser created company owned medical clinics that would later serve as a model for what is known today as a health maintenance organization (HMO).\n The staff of Model Railroader Magazine paid homage to the Eagle Mountain Railroad by building a 4 foot by 6 foot HO scale layout in the January 2016 through January 2017 issues of Model Railroader (The January 2016 issue was the introduction of the layout while the rest was featured in the step-by-step column).\n\nSee also\n List of defunct California railroads\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n San Diego Railway Museum: Photo of EMRR Caboose\n\nDefunct California railroads\nIron ore railways\nMining railways in the United States\nEagle Mountain, Railroad\nTransportation in Riverside County, California\nEagle Mountain, Railroad\nCompanies based in San Bernardino County, California\nEagle Mountain, Railroad\nRailway lines opened in 1948\nRailway lines closed in 1986\n1948 establishments in California\n1986 disestablishments in California"}
{"id": "4107691", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haven%3A%20Call%20of%20the%20King", "title": "Haven: Call of the King", "text": "Haven: Call of the King is a 2002 multi-genre action-adventure video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by Midway Games for the PlayStation 2. The game was also scheduled for release on the Xbox and GameCube, to be published by Xicat Interactive, but both versions were cancelled. A Game Boy Advance version was also planned, but never got beyond the earliest developmental stages.\n\nIntended as the first part of a trilogy, Haven took over three years to develop, and combines action, platforming, puzzle, shoot 'em up, racing and space combat elements. Both Midway and Traveller's Tales championed Haven as a previously unseen type of game, wherein the player could jump seamlessly from genre to genre, with Midway trademarking the term \"FreeFormer gameplay\" to describe the mixture of gameplay styles.\n\nHaven received mixed reviews, with the main complaint amongst critics being that it was too ambitious for its own good, producing multiple examples of average gameplay, but nothing outstanding. Although Midway launched a sizable advertising campaign to promote the game, calling it \"the next major development in videogaming,\" it received relatively little media attention and was a considerable commercial failure. The two sequels were never made.\n\nGameplay \n\nAt its core, Haven: Call of the King is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, with much of the gameplay based around platforming. During the main platforming levels, Haven can perform various basic abilities; jump, double jump, high jump, crouch and attack. Haven also has access to an energy shield which he can deploy in front of him to protect him from incoming projectiles. He can deploy the shield indefinitely if it is not absorbing any impacts, but when it does deflect objects, it begins to deplete. As well as deploying the shield in front of him, Haven can also crouch and completely cover himself with the shield. He can also use the shield to perform a \"shield smash,\" which is necessary for killing certain enemies and accessing certain pots.\n\nHaven's main offensive weapon is a modified yo-yo device known as a \"mag-ball.\" Its range is limited, but it can be used to defeat enemies, smash pots and grip onto \"mag-rides;\" electrical transports which bring Haven to other locations in a level. Haven can also use the mag-ball to perform a \"power-spin\" (where he spins 360 degrees with the mag-ball extended at all times, damaging anything that comes within range). He can also acquire a variety of firearms during the game, which briefly replace the mag-ball as his offensive weapon. These weapons include a laser shot, a rapid-fire cannon, a ricochet cannon, a five-way shot and a plasma shot.\n\nA major part of the gameplay during platforming levels involves item collecting. For example, hearts, which are found in pots scattered throughout most levels and also dropped by some defeated enemies, replenish Haven's health. Catana orbs (small yellow disk-like objects) replenish his antidote meter, which, if it falls to zero, begins to deplete his health. Shield energy replenishes his shield abilities. Other collectibles include feathers, which are necessary for Haven to call Talon, a mechanical bird he has constructed. Often, calling Talon is necessary to progress through a level. On other occasions, Talon can carry Haven to secret parts of a level, otherwise inaccessible. Cogs are necessary to operate machinery, and are always a story-related items. Also found in many levels are silver keys. Any level which has a \"Runepot\" requires Haven to locate five silver keys before he can open the pot. Runepots hold Runestones, which can be used to unlock secret Runetowers later in the game. Completing the challenges in the Runetowers reveals Black Diamonds, which must be collected if the player wishes to complete the game to 100%.\n\nOther gameplay sections involve different control schemes and game mechanics. For example, when wearing the jet pack, Haven can accelerate upwards by expending fuel. When using the glider, as well as basic maneuverability, he can perform an air brake. In the biplane, he can roll left and right. In the speedboat and quadracer, he can accelerate and brake. When operating a turret or spaceship, he has access to forward and aft missiles and can lock on to enemies. The spaceship Sunsurfer, which Haven acquires towards the end of the game, also has access to different types of missiles, and can equip a shield.\n\nSynopsis\n\nBackground\nOne thousand years before the commencement of the game, King Athellion departed his home world to fight in an intergalactic crusade. On the Mount of Sighs, he left a giant bell, the Golden Voice, which was to be rung to call his return should he ever be needed. Many years later, an evil being named Lord Vetch enslaved Athellion's people, forcing them to work in his mines. To ensure their servitude, Vetch infected every slave with a deadly virus requiring a constant dose of antidote, the only source of which he controlled. He also ensured the people had no knowledge of the Golden Voice, or of King Athellion.\n\nPlot\nThe game begins with Vetch (voiced by Steve Tarlow) receiving a transmission from his lieutenant, Overlord (Jason Gregory), who tells him a slave named Haven has been dreaming about the Golden Voice, something Vetch hopes to turn to his advantage. Meanwhile, in Virescent Village on the planet Ferra, Haven (Jake Rosewall-Gallagher) heads to work in the mines. There, he sees his friend Chess (Regan Kerwan) being questioned by a guard, who tries to shoot Haven. However, he misses, and causes the mine to collapse, knocking out Haven.\n\nUpon awakening, he learns Chess hasn't been seen since the collapse. Setting out to find her, Haven reaches Darkwater Castle, home of Overlord, who contacts Vetch to tell him their plan is going well. Haven watches Overlord interrogate Chess about Haven's dreams. She refuses to tell him anything, and Haven intervenes, killing Overlord and freeing Chess. They escape, and Chess says that while in detention, she heard Overlord mention a wise old slave on the Isle of Heroes.\n\nHaven heads there, and meets the Wise Man (Terry Bertram), who tells him the legend of Athellion; Vetch was determined to conquer Athellion's city, Aurias. However, he was unable to even approach the city, as its light would blind him. When Athellion left for the war, Vetch bribed a council member to infect the people with the virus, so they became his slaves. Over time, even the location of the Mount of Sighs has been forgotten. However, the Wise Man directs Haven to a map identifying the location of the Mount on the planet Auria. Haven reaches the Golden Voice, reading a warning stating that once the bell is rung, the person who rings it must wait there for Athellion's return. He rings it, but immediately Chess contacts him, telling him she is stranded without any antidote. He reluctantly leaves, returning to Ferra, and rescuing Chess.\n\nHowever, she reveals she has been working with Vetch all along, who appears and congratulates her on her deception. Vetch tells Haven that Chess is one of his spies, deployed throughout his slave colonies to keep watch for anyone speaking of the Golden Voice. Vetch explains he had Chess call Haven away from the Mount of Sighs immediately after ringing the bell because the legend says that if the person who rings the bell does not remain on the Mount until Athellion's return, Athellion must return to wherever that person is - thus Vetch plans to wait until Athellion appears to Haven, and then kill him. With no more use for Chess, Vetch decides she can die with Haven. At this moment, Athellion arrives, telling Vetch he will surrender if Haven and Chess are spared. Vetch agrees, imprisoning them, and bringing Athellion back to the Mount of Sighs.\n\nHaven escapes, but is unable to free Chess, and so sets out in pursuit of Vetch alone. He returns to the Mount of Sighs, where he sees Vetch kill Athellion. Haven confronts Vetch, but is defeated. However, the power of the Mount of Sighs keeps him alive. Vetch then ties Haven to a rock, pointing out \"you can't live forever\" and leaves him alone on the planet. The game ends on this cliffhanger.\n\nDevelopment \nHaven: Call of the King was first announced on 16 May 2002 when Midway Games revealed they had partnered with Traveller's Tales to develop an original multi-genre game. Midway announced that Haven would be a third-person game with strong platforming elements combined with many other types of genre, such as turret-based shooting, land and water racing, space combat, and arena battles. They also revealed the game would debut on the PlayStation 2, but would subsequently be released for Xbox and GameCube.\n\nThe game was first shown the following week, at the 2002 E3 event, where a playable demo was made available. Whilst no narrative or story elements were in place yet, the demo featured environments from the Virescent Village level and the refinery level. Midway stressed the free-roaming nature of the game, saying \"you can fully roam throughout the large environments on the ground, then get into a spaceship, point it at the sky and climb to outer space. Up there, you'll be able to do battle with whatever's mean, then return to the ground and start walking around again.\" GameSpot's Gerald Villoria wrote of this aspect of the demo \"the planet and all the explorable areas in Haven are seamlessly linked--traveling from one area of the world to the next should incur no game stoppage due to load times. In fact, when Haven gains access to his flying vessel, he can literally rise above the planet's atmosphere and explore any of the continents. The landmasses smoothly raise in level of detail as the descending aircraft approaches, with nearly featureless topography slowly morphing into fully landscaped wilderness until the ship can literally hover above the treetops.\"\n\nIn a June interview with GameSpot, Traveller's Tales revealed the game had been in development for over three years, with them funding the project themselves, long before Midway got involved. They explained the game uses a game engine specifically designed for Haven, which allows smooth transition from third-person gameplay to piloting a vehicle. The engine also powers the cutscenes, allowing the camera to move and sweep around the landscape of a level, giving the player an idea of the route they have to take. Landscapes are fractally generated using the PlayStation 2's vector processors, which allows for considerable draw distance. The game also features night and day cycles and alternating weather patterns, such as randomly occurring rain showers (which prompt Haven to pull his hood up when outdoors). The developers were also keen to stress the game features no loading times; \"Traveller's Tales intends for the game's loading to be invisible to players after the initial startup, thanks to carefully managed memory usage and constant streaming.\" They also revealed that after the PlayStation 2 launch, the game would be released for the Game Boy Advance as well as GameCube and Xbox.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with Gamasutra, writer/director/designer Jon Burton stated\n\nIn July, a more complete demo was made available to gaming websites, featuring platforming levels, space combat, racing, and underwater sections. Traveller's Tales explained the game's story had been written first, with concept art then designed by Rodney Matthews. The story was then broken down into different gameplay genres. Expert game designers for each genre were brought on board to develop each small section of the game. The main team of developers then took each of those sections and attempted to unify them into one seamless whole. This demo also revealed more of the capabilities of the game engine, which could depict heat distortions, particle effects, real-time light sourcing, shadows, and reflections, as well as the already revealed day and nights cycles and random weather effects.\n\nGameSpot's Ricardo Torres noted that \"the varied landscape is fractally generated using the PlayStation 2's vector units, which are working overtime for the game and allow for some very impressive effects. For example, when you board a spaceship in a third-person sequence in the game, you'll be able to take off and head out into space without a loading screen. The game will track your movement and reduce the size and detail of the environments as you gain altitude. The reverse is true when you're approaching a planet and go to land--you'll find that detail seen from the air will scale in as you get closer.\"\n\nHowever, in August, IGN's Hilary Goldstein expressed concern about the lack of attention the game was getting; \"Haven has received little to no hype. In fact, it seems barely on the consciousness of the gaming public at all.\" On 30 October, Midway trademarked the term \"FreeFormer gameplay\" to describe the gameplay mechanics, stating \"FreeFormer gameplay is the next major development in videogaming. The technology in Haven: Call of the King allows for an unbelievable cinematic-style smoothness and experience as you encounter the varied play mechanics in the game.\"\n\nCancelled ports \nOn 29 May 2003, Xicat Interactive announced that despite the game's commercial failure on PlayStation 2, they would be publishing the game for both the Xbox and GameCube later in the year. However, neither version was ever made.\n\nReception \n\nHaven: Call of the King received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nGameSpot's Mathew Gallant called it \"an often surprising action-packed platformer with a distinctive style and plenty of challenge.\" He was critical of Haven's mag-ball weapon, writing \"the jumping and other mechanics of Haven are solid, but the limitations of the mag-ball and the fairly frequent requirements of its use tend to overshadow them.\" He concluded \"While Haven does offer a lot, it's not quite a sure bet. Primarily, the annoying control problems involved with the mag-ball can make an already difficult game needlessly frustrating [...] Yet the overall feel is that of a very intense and action-packed game. The fast-paced, quickly changing gameplay is refreshingly unordinary, and while there's an excellent chance that fans of platformers will love the diversity and challenge, some may find it a little too restless and overdone.\"\n\nIGN's Chris Roper called the game \"both great and deeply flawed.\" He praised the gameplay types, writing \"variety is what this game's all about, and it's quite welcome.\" However, he was critical of the lack of story integration into the variation in gameplay styles; \"One complaint about nearly every goal is that it often doesn't make any sense why you're doing what you're doing.\" He concluded \"Haven: Call of the King is quite an ambitious title. At certain points it's great, but at others it can be either frustrating or very boring. The game ties in most of the different genres in a pretty smooth manner. Nothing seems entirely out of place [...] Overall, the game is worth playing through. You'll have to tough it out through some aggravatingly boring sections, but when the game strays from the basics a bit, it can get to be quite fun.\"\n\nEurogamers Kristan Reed found the game less innovative than Midway claimed: \"being mainly a platform game with sub sections to add variety, it comes across as being more heavily indebted to the likes of Jak & Daxter and Ratchet & Clank than being anything revolutionary.\" He concluded, \"Havens pretensions to be some kind of revolutionary product seem sound and exciting on the surface, but scratch that surface for more than an hour or so, and it's apparent that what we're really dealing with is a better than average platformer with cleverly interspersed minigames to present the illusion of expansiveness and freedom [...] That's not to say it's a bad game, or that you won't enjoy it. If you're a real dyed in the wool platform gamer, Haven has plenty to admire, but it just fails to match or better what's gone before.\"\n\nGame Revolution's Johnny Liu was critical of the core platformer gameplay: \"the platform events come off as a standard, undisguised item hunt.\" Of the graphics, he wrote \"the quality varies. Outdoor environments are doused in an over-saturated color palette, though the frame rate is smooth enough. The detail work in some of the interior dungeons offers some sharper textures and compelling lighting effects.\" He concluded \"Though it's admirably ambitious, Haven is crippled by trying to do too much. Instead of simply having these separate parts strung together, it would have worked better had the game allowed you to switch from any of these game styles at will.\"\n\nGameSpy's Benjamin Turner said, \"The designers [are] attempting to create something unique by combining gameplay ideas from platformers, 3D shooters, vehicular action games and even Marble Madness. While the end result doesn't quite gel, I have to appreciate the fact that they tried.\" However, he noted that \"rather than excelling, it ends up doing a fairly mediocre job of almost everything.\" He called the platforming sections \"rough around the edges,\" criticizing the collision detection and level design, and was unimpressed with Haven's mag-ball. He concluded \"there's just too much mediocrity and not enough quality. With a ton of tweaking and a heavy dose of polish this could have been a pretty good game. I get the sense that the creators' hearts were in the right places, but for whatever reason they couldn't execute. Their creation feels unfinished.\"\n\nCancelled sequels \nHaven was originally intended as the first part of a trilogy, however, due to the game's commercial failure, the second and third parts were never made. For writer/director/designer Jon Burton, the game was an extremely personal project. Speaking in 2006, he opined that because it began as a basic platformer, players and reviewers didn't give it a fair chance: \"Because the first hour was basically a platform game people would play the game and write it off as another platformer.\" Burton always intended for the story to continue, and had very specific ideas as to how the plot would have developed:\n\nReferences \n\n2002 video games\n3D platform games\nAction-adventure games\nCancelled Game Boy Advance games\nCancelled GameCube games\nCancelled Xbox games\nMidway video games\nPlayStation 2 games\nPlayStation 2-only games\nPuzzle video games\nSingle-player video games\nSpace combat simulators\nTraveller's Tales games\nVideo games developed in the United Kingdom\nVideo games set on fictional planets\nVideo games scored by Andy Blythe and Marten Joustra"}

{"id": "4107725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle%20of%20Kolb%27s%20Farm", "title": "Battle of Kolb's Farm", "text": "The Battle of Kolb's Farm (June 22, 1864) saw a Confederate corps under Lieutenant General John B. Hood attack parts of two Union corps under Major Generals Joseph Hooker and John Schofield. This action was part of the Atlanta campaign of the American Civil War fought between the Confederate Army of Tennessee led by General Joseph E. Johnston and Union forces commanded by Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Hood believed that he had an opportunity to inflict a defeat on the Union forces in front of his corps and ordered an assault. However, Hooker's and Schofield's troops were deployed in good positions and they repulsed Hood's soldiers with serious losses.\n\nAfter Hooker made his battle report, a dispute arose between him and Sherman. This was caused by an exaggerated claim made by Hooker and a probable misunderstanding on Sherman's part. Already there was mistrust between the two generals and the dispute only made relations worse. Though the Union won a tactical victory at Kolb's Farm, Sherman's maneuver to turn the Confederate left flank appeared to be blocked. Frustrated in his attempts to outflank Johnston's army, Sherman ordered a frontal assault five days later.\n\nBackground\n\nUnion Army\n\nGeneral-in-chief of the Union Army Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant ordered Sherman, \"to move against Johnston's army, to break it up, and to get into the interior of the enemy's country as far as you can, inflicting all the damage you can against their war resources\".\n\nSherman commanded elements of three armies. The Army of the Cumberland under Major General George H. Thomas was made up of the IV Corps led by Major General Oliver Otis Howard, the XIV Corps under Major General John M. Palmer, the XX Corps commanded by Major General Joseph Hooker, and three cavalry divisions led by Brigadier Generals Edward M. McCook, Kenner Garrard, and Hugh Judson Kilpatrick. The Army of the Tennessee led by Major General James B. McPherson included the XV Corps under Major General John A. Logan, the Left Wing of the XVI Corps under Major General Grenville M. Dodge, and the XVII Corps under Major General Francis Preston Blair Jr. The Army of the Ohio commanded by Major General John Schofield consisted of the XXIII Corps under Schofield and a cavalry division commanded by Major General George Stoneman.\n\nSherman began his campaign with almost 100,000 men, including Thomas' 60,000 and 130 guns, McPherson's 25,000 and 96 guns, and Schofield's 14,000 men and 28 guns. Through the fighting near Dallas, Sherman lost 12,000 casualties, but was reinforced by the fresh XVII Corps at that time.\n\nConfederate Army\n\nJohnston's Army of Tennessee began the campaign with two infantry corps led by Lieutenant Generals William J. Hardee and John Bell Hood, and a cavalry corps under Major General Joseph Wheeler. The army was soon reinforced from the Army of Mississippi by the corps of Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk and the cavalry division of Brigadier General William Hicks Jackson.\n\nPolk was killed at Pine Mountain on June 14 and temporarily replaced by Major General William Wing Loring. Hardee's corps included the divisions of Major Generals William B. Bate, Benjamin F. Cheatham, Patrick Cleburne, and William H. T. Walker. Hood's corps comprised the divisions of Major Generals Thomas C. Hindman, Carter L. Stevenson, and Alexander P. Stewart. Polk's corps was made up of the divisions of Major Generals Edward C. Walthall and Samuel Gibbs French, and Brigadier General Winfield S. Featherston.\n\nAs recently as the Battle of Cassville on May 19, the Confederate army had numbered 70,000–74,000 troops. Since then, Johnston's army sustained about 3,000 casualties in the fighting near Dallas.\n\nPrevious operations\nThe Atlanta campaign began on May 7, 1864, when Sherman's forces began to advance. Sherman sent McPherson's army on a wide swing to the west while the armies under Thomas and Schofield pressed Johnston's defenses frontally. After the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge, Johnston withdrew from the Dalton position. The Battle of Resaca occurred on May 13–16, after which Johnston retreated again.\n\nAfter a skirmish at Adairsville, Johnston tried to set a trap for Sherman's forces, which were advancing on a broad front. At the Battle of Cassville on May 19, Johnston's attempted counterstroke miscarried and the Confederate army withdrew the next day. Since the Confederate defenses at Allatoona Pass were too strong, Sherman tried to turn Johnston's position by a wide sweep to the west. This resulted in a series of actions in late May known as the battles of New Hope Church, Pickett's Mill, and Dallas. The Union forces then shifted to the east and finally forced Johnston to order another retreat.\n\nIn mid-June, a series of actions took place near Gilgal Church and Pine Mountain, after which Johnston fell back to Kennesaw Mountain.\n\nKennesaw\n\nKennesaw Mountain represented the key to the Confederate defenses. The railroad coming from the north veered to the northeast past Kennesaw's northern end, then turned south before reaching Marietta.\n\nThe mountain ridge runs northeast to southwest with three notable features. These are Big Kennesaw, which stands  above the surrounding terrain at the northeast end, Little Kennesaw with its nearly  summit, and Pigeon Hill with its  height at the southwest end. From Big Kennesaw's dominating summit, any daytime movements by the Union forces could be immediately observed. Kennesaw Mountain was probably a stronger position than Rocky Face Ridge and Allatoona Pass.\n\nHood's corps held the Confederate right flank east of Kennesaw Mountain and north of Marietta. Loring's corps held the mountain in the center, with Featherston's division on the right, Walthall's division in the center, and French's division on the left. Hardee's corps held the left flank, with the divisions of Walker, Bate, Cleburne, and Cheatham deployed from right to left. Hardee's troops were posted behind Noses Creek, which was swollen from the recent heavy rains. In front of the main Confederate defenses was a fortified outpost line. The Confederate infantry defended a  long front. Wheeler's cavalry guarded the right flank while Jackson's cavalry watched the left flank.\n\nOn the morning of June 19, Sherman optimistically believed that the Confederates had withdrawn to the Chattahoochie River, but by the day's end he realized that assessment was wrong. McPherson's three corps formed the Federal left wing, with Blair's corps on the extreme left flank. Thomas' army advanced with Palmer's corps on the left, Howard's corps in the center, and Hooker's corps on the right. On the Union right wing, Schofield's corps marched southeast along the Sandtown Road. There was a vigorous cavalry clash on the left between Garrard's division and Wheeler. Hooker was able to cross Noses Creek at a place where the stream curved to the west, and established his corps on the east side of the creek. Schofield reached the place where the road from Powder Springs Church to Marietta spanned Noses Creek, but did not attempt to cross.\n\nFederal cannons took Pigeon Hill under fire, inflicting 35 casualties on French's Missouri brigade, including its commander Brigadier General Francis Cockrell. French responded by having his gun crews drag their cannons up Pigeon Hill.\n\nOn June 20, Sherman began extending his right wing toward the south. Howard ordered Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood's division and a brigade from Major General David S. Stanley's division to replace the left flank of Hooker's corps. Brigadier General Alpheus S. Williams's division on Hooker's left shifted to the right flank of the corps. Later, Stanley's other brigades were able to cross to the west bank of Noses Creek. They seized two hills and were counterattacked by Confederates who recaptured one of them.\n\nStanley's division suffered 250 casualties in the fighting. Since it rained again that day, Sherman decided not to try any attacks until the weather cleared. Brigadier General Jacob Dolson Cox's division of Schofield's corps made a successful crossing of Noses Creek and entrenched on the east side. The constant rain caused many sick soldiers in both Union and Confederate armies to be evacuated to the rear.\n\nBattle\n\nJune 21 movements\n\nOn June 21, Sherman's army continued shifting to its right. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee relieved part of Thomas' Army of the Cumberland. Palmer's corps replaced Brigadier General John Newton's division of Howard's corps. In turn, Newton's division took over the left flank of Hooker's corps, allowing it to extend to the right. Howard's corps retook the hill previously captured by the Confederates and seized ground which enabled it to advance several hundred yards. Hooker's corps pushed forward at the same time, occupying some hills near Kolb's (also known as Culp's) Farm while maintaining contact with Howard's corps on its left.\n\nBrigadier General Milo S. Hascall's division of Schofield's corps crossed Noses Creek and made contact with the right flank of Hooker's corps. Stoneman's horsemen clashed with Jackson's division on Schofield's right flank.\n\nJohnston noted Sherman's extension of his right wing and decided that Hardee's lines had been stretched almost to their limit. Therefore, he decided to counter it by moving Hood's corps from his right to his left flank. To fill the gap, Johnston ordered Loring to extend his corps to its right and instructed Wheeler to dismount his cavalrymen to man Hood's trenches.\n\nJohnston knew that McPherson might attack his weakened right flank, but all Sherman's recent moves were by the Union right flank. Johnston decided to accept the risk because he felt that his only other alternative was to retreat. In the morning of June 21, Schofield believed that the way to Marietta was unguarded. However, by the evening, Schofield suspected that he was facing substantial opposition. In fact, Hood's corps left its original position in the morning and camped on the Powder Springs road west of Marietta in the evening.\n\nJune 22 action\n\nJune 22 dawned with clear skies, so Sherman decided to make a major effort to force Johnston to retreat. He ordered Thomas to direct Hooker to move his corps east toward Marietta. Sherman instructed Schofield to advance along the Powder Springs-Marietta road before linking with Hooker's right flank, and to guard the Cheney House where the Sandtown road met the Powder Springs road. Early in the afternoon, Hooker advanced with Major General Daniel Butterfield's division on the left, Brigadier General John W. Geary in the center, and Williams on the right. Soon, Hooker's skirmishers reported that Confederates were ahead and forming for an attack. This information prompted Hooker to order his corps to entrench on a line from Howard's right flank to Kolb's Farm on the Powder Springs-Marietta road. South of the road facing east, Colonel Silas A. Strickland's brigade of Hascall's XXIII Corps division also fortified its position. The rest of Hascall's brigades were to Strickland's right and facing southeast. Farther south was Cox's division guarding the area near Cheney House.\n\nIn the Atlanta campaign to date, Hooker's XX Corps suffered 5,000 casualties, more than any other of Sherman's formations, after starting with 20,000 men.\n\nWilliams' division was deployed with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Thomas H. Ruger and Joseph F. Knipe on the right and center, and Colonel James S. Robinson's brigade on the left.\n\nWilliams sent the 123rd New York Infantry Regiment forward into the woods on a reconnaissance, while Hascall ordered the 14th Kentucky Infantry Regiment on the same mission. Both units pressed forward to positions where they saw large numbers of Confederates massing for an attack, and they reported this information. Hooker twice asked Thomas to reinforce his corps, claiming the \"whole rebel army\" was in front of him. This prompted Thomas to personally look over the situation. He concluded that the threat was exaggerated, and that Hooker's line was sufficiently strong to defend itself.\n\nOn Geary's right there was a hill surrounded by open fields; this was entrenched and crowned with artillery. Small marshy streams ran between Williams' brigades and in the interval between Geary and Williams.\n\nHascall's division consisted of the brigades of Colonels John McQuiston, William E. Hobson, and Strickland. Schofield, who was with Hascall when the 14th Kentucky's report came in, ordered Cox to leave one brigade at Cheney House and march to Hascall's support. Leaving Colonel James W. Reilly's brigade, Cox marched with the three others, but the action was over before they went very far. They were then placed to the right of Hascall's brigades. Cox's brigades were led by Colonels Daniel Cameron, Richard F. Barter, Robert K. Byrd, and Reilly.\n\nDuring the early afternoon of June 22, Hood's corps moved along the Powder Springs road until it was  west of Mount Zion Church. Hood then deployed his corps with Stevenson's division athwart the road, Hindman's division to its right, and Stewart's division directly behind Stevenson. Hood ordered his division commanders to drive the Federals toward Manning's Mill, which was  west of Kolb's Farm. Hood sent a message to Johnston claiming incorrectly that he defeated a Union attack and that he was counterattacking. Hood's daily report was unclear about what happened that day, his memoirs never referred to the Kolb's Farm action, and other Confederate sources were silent. Therefore, Hood's motives that day can only be inferred. Apparently, he believed that the Federals were advancing in march column and that his troops were executing a powerful flank attack against an unready opponent. The Confederate assault began a short time after 5 pm.\n\nStevenson arranged his division with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Alfred Cumming and Edmund Pettus on the left with Cumming in front. On the right were the brigades of Brigadier Generals John C. Brown and Alexander W. Reynolds on the right, with Brown in front. Cumming's brigade, which consisted largely of former Georgia militia, advanced through dense foliage until they received a volley from the 14th Kentucky at a range of .\n\nCumming's troops retreated in confusion, rallied, attacked again, and were repulsed a second time. Outflanked when the 123rd New York was driven back, the 14th Kentucky fell back to a second position and continued to resist. Finally, Hascall peremptorily ordered the 14th Kentucky to withdraw to the main line; its commander Colonel George Gallup later claimed that 69 dead Confederates were found in front of his regiment's position. When the Confederates attacked Strickland's defenses, they were driven off by rifle fire and by canister shot from Shields' 19th Ohio Battery and Paddock's Battery F, 1st Michigan.\n\nNorth of the road, Brown's and Reynolds' troops quickly drove back the 123rd New York and advanced into cleared fields in front of the brigades of Ruger and Knipe. When the Confederates emerged they were pounded by the 13th New York Battery from Geary's hill. These guns were joined by the 3-inch Ordnance rifles of Winegar's Battery I, 1st New York and the 12-pounder Napoleons of Woodbury's Battery M, 1st New York from Williams' division. Stevenson's soldiers were briefly able to penetrate a hollow between Williams and Geary, but were soon compelled to recoil under the combined rifle and artillery fire. During the attack, Hooker asked for Howard to release Butterfield's division, but it could not be moved immediately. Instead, Howard sent a few reserve regiments to Hooker's aid. Later that night, Howard finally released Butterfield's division. While most of Stevenson's men fell back to the woods, some soldiers took cover in a ravine. It soon proved to be a death trap when it became the target of one of Williams' batteries.\n\nHindman's division stormed out of the woods after Stevenson's men began to retreat. The division moved toward Robinson's brigade and Geary's right flank. Hindman's left flank was composed of the brigades of Brigadier Generals Zachariah C. Deas and William F. Tucker. These formations halted as soon as they came under artillery fire and fled in confusion. Hindman's right flank consisted of the brigades of Brigadier Generals Edward C. Walthall and Arthur Middleton Manigault. Walthall's men went to ground as soon as they came under fire. Manigault's troops faced a patch of marshy ground in the area that complicated their advance. After trying and failing to cross a boggy creek under heavy fire, the soldiers either fled or took cover. According to Williams' account, Hindman's division was repulsed by artillery alone, Williams's infantry having taken no part in the fighting in that area.\n\nAftermath\n\nLosses\n\nJohnston admitted losing 1,000 troops in the battle. Williams reported sustaining 130 casualties, while Hascall's loss was about the same. Geary's losses were \"trifling\". Historian Albert E. Castel estimated that Hood's attack cost his corps 1,500 killed, wounded, and missing, two-thirds of which were from Stevenson's division. Castel calculated that total Union casualties were 250, of which 86 were from Knipe's brigade and 72 were from Strickland's brigade. The 123rd New York lost 48 casualties while the 14th Kentucky lost 12 killed and 48 wounded. Castel called the action, \"more a one-sided slaughter than a battle\". The above losses were echoed by an article by Scott Wilbur for the National Park Service. Wilbur also stated that the Union forces engaged in the action outnumbered Hood by 14,000 to 11,000.\n\nSherman-Hooker dispute\nSherman told Schofield that, \"I will probably meet you today at Mrs. Kolb's.\" Nevertheless, Sherman spent the day with the corps of Howard and Palmer. At 5:30 pm, Hooker received a message from Sherman asking, \"How are you getting along? Near what house are you?\" Sherman had heard some cannon fire, but it did not seem like anything serious. Sherman returned to his headquarters at Big Shanty that evening. Hooker immediately replied but his message was unaccountably delayed. At 9:30 pm, Sherman finally received Hooker's note, which read as follows.\n\nSherman wondered why Hooker was anxious about his right flank since Schofield's corps was supposed to be there. He did not understand how he could have missed the sound of \"two heavy attacks\". At 9:30 pm, Sherman issued a reply to Hooker.\n\nSherman sent Thomas a message asking him to make sure Schofield was on Hooker's right. Thomas sent two replies saying that the situation on the right flank was under control, and suggesting that only weak Confederate forces must be in front of McPherson. Finally, Sherman received a message from Schofield reporting that Hood's corps attacked his and Hooker's positions at Kolb's Farm and was defeated. According to Sherman's Memoirs, written ten years after the war, he rode to the right flank on the morning of June 23 to meet with Schofield and Hooker. When he presented Hooker's message, Schofield became angry, saying his troops were in their proper position on the right. Sherman wrote that he chided Hooker for claiming three corps were in front of him.\n\nCastel asserted that the account in Sherman's Memoirs was the product of faulty memory and personal animosity toward Hooker. Schofield later denied being angry with Hooker, and suggested that Sherman must have misunderstood Hooker's message. In fact, in Hooker's report to Thomas at midnight, he credited Hascall for helping to repulse Hood's assault. Schofield wrote that he did not recall meeting with Sherman in the morning and perhaps the commanding general met with Hascall instead. Hooker's claim that he faced three corps was absurd, but there was an element of truth to it. While Hood's corps was in front of Hooker and Schofield, part of Hardee's corps opposed Butterfield's division, and one of the Confederate cavalry brigades in the area originally belonged to the Army of Mississippi, that is, Loring's corps. In any case, once the action began, Hooker performed superbly as a combat leader.\n\nHooker already resented Sherman's obvious favoritism toward McPherson's Army of the Tennessee. He also believed that Sherman mishandled his corps at the Battle of New Hope Church. The Kolb's Farm incident led to a steady decline in Hooker's standing with Sherman. When McPherson was killed on July 22, Hooker expected to be promoted to command the Army of the Tennessee, since he was senior in rank. Doubting that Hooker would prove to be a cooperative and loyal subordinate, Sherman passed over him and selected Howard to replace McPherson. Hooker found this especially insulting because he blamed Howard for his defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Hooker promptly tendered his resignation, which Sherman accepted.\n\nSherman frustrated\n\nBy the following day, Hood's corps entrenched itself and it was clear that assaulting it would be foolish. Sherman instructed Schofield to find whether the Confederate left flank could be turned. On the afternoon of June 23, Reilly's brigade moved south along the Sandtown road to where it crossed Olley's Creek. Reilly found dismounted and barricaded soldiers from Brigadier General Lawrence Sullivan Ross' cavalry brigade defending the crossing. Schofield reported to Sherman that his corps was extended too far. Clearly, Schofield was not able to outflank the Confederates unless Thomas' army shifted to its right. Thomas reported that his army was already extended too much. Furthermore, Sherman received a report that McCook's cavalrymen were unable to damage the railroad line supplying Johnston's army because they were unable to cross the Chattahoochie River. A frustrated Sherman sent a telegram to Union Army Chief of Staff Major General Henry Halleck that, \"The whole country is one vast fort ... As fast as we gain one position the enemy has another all ready\".\n\nSherman faced three choices: use McPherson to hit Johnston's right flank, wear down the Confederates trenches by artillery barrages and short infantry advances, or make a frontal assault. Even though Blair reported that the trenches in front of him were held by cavalry, Sherman rejected the first choice. He was so fearful that Johnston might strike his vital railroad supply line near Big Shanty, that Sherman wanted McPherson to strongly guard that area. He also rejected the second choice. One of his strategic missions was to prevent Johnston from reinforcing General Robert E. Lee's army, so Sherman could not allow a stalemate to develop. Therefore, Sherman resolved to adopt the third choice: to make a frontal attack. He reasoned that he outnumbered Johnston, yet the Confederate trench lines were longer than his own. Therefore, they must be weak somewhere. This resulted in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27 in which the Union attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties.\n\nBattlefield condition \nMuch of the battlefield landscape has been altered and fragmented. Some essential features remain, however, including the Kolb farm house and family cemetery, Ward Creek, and the heights used by the Federal XX and XXIII Corps in their repulse of the Confederate assault. These resources are protected within the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. Residential subdivisions have hemmed in the park land and overwhelmed the battlefield landscape beyond the park boundary, including the heights from which the Confederates began their assault.\n\nNotes\nFootnotes\n\nCitations\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n This is a good battle map. \n\nKolb's Farm\nKolb's Farm\nCobb County, Georgia\nKolb's Farm\nKolb's Farm\nKolb's Farm\n1864 in Georgia (U.S. state)\nJune 1864 events"}

It is the first console game to feature Aardman Animations' characters Wallace and Gromit and also features the voice of Wallace, Peter Sallis reprising his role.\n\nGameplay\nAs Gromit, the player must use Wallace's bizarre inventions - including the Porridge Gun, Turnip Launcher, Springy Boots, and Gyrocopter - to battle Feathers McGraw's robotic minions and rescue the baby animals in typical platform game style.\n\nPlot\nWallace and Gromit have adopted Archie; a baby polar bear at the local zoo. However, when they go to the zoo to celebrate his birthday, they find the zoo padlocked and supposedly under new management. They soon discover that Feathers McGraw (the villain from The Wrong Trousers) is now running the zoo and has kidnapped Archie. Back at home, Wallace and Gromit design a giant wooden penguin (a parody of the Trojan Horse) which gets them inside the zoo.\nEntering the jungle house, they find that Feathers has captured baby elephants to force their parents to work for him. To help Gromit, Wallace fashions a telescope into a banana gun as the first weapon of the game. Upon rescuing the first baby elephant, the parents push down a set of doors allowing them access to the next area. Upon making their way to the temple, the duo are almost flattened by a rolling boulder trap, but it is able to smash a way out for them. In the Temple, Gromit also gains a new tool of a torch, allowing him to illuminate areas or light fuses. After repairing a panel damaged by the boulder, Wallace finds an entrance to a mine where Gromit must battle a mole machine in the first boss fight of the game with the aid of Wallace's Go-Higher Springy Boots. After the mole machine is destroyed, Feathers escapes underground. Wallace sees a poster nearby denoting a countdown to D-Day, which he finds odd.\n\nTravelling underground, Wallace and Gromit are briefly separated, forcing Gromit to navigate mining machinery and mine cart tracks. It also turns out Feathers has imprisoned baby beavers to force their parents to work. Upon Gromit freeing the first baby beaver, Wallace finds himself trapped on a bridge, so Gromit must detonate explosives to free him. Upon doing this, Wallace repairs the lift leading them to a large cave where Gromit must free two other beavers, in the process gaining a new weapon of a Porridge gun. Wallace discovers drainage, along with Feathers flying a helicopter so quickly engineers a Gyro-Copter, allowing them to give chase to the Volcanic sector. Upon being cornered by the duo, Feathers drops them through a trapdoor into a flooded room where they are nearly crushed before Gromit unlocks the door.\nAfter obtaining the new tool of a fire extinguisher, the duo are briefly get separated again, with Gromit needing to navigate around lava, fire and enemies before they are reunited and find imprisoned baby gorillas who Gromit is soon able to free. In appreciation, the gorillas open up the lift, allowing them further access.\nEventually, after freeing all three gorillas, Wallace and Gromit find their way back to the Gyro-Copter, where they see Feathers activating some machinery.\n\nUsing the Gyro-copter and the porridge gun, they gum up the machinery and Feathers uses an escape pod to flee, which they follow, eventually crash landing in a warehouse.\nInside the warehouse, they find Feathers has captured baby pandas and must deal with enemies, machinery and goons to free them. In the process, Wallace also builds the last main weapon of the game; a high velocity turnip launcher. After eventually finding Feathers and Archie, Feathers cuts the lights, allowing him to escape to the Polar exhibit, where he has captured 3 baby polar bears, with one of them having to be rescued by activating 3 steam valves to produce hot water needed to melt the ice. Eventually, Wallace soups up a pedlo boat with a turnip launcher. After obtaining Feathers' remote control, Wallace accidentally activates Feathers' submarine, forcing Gromit to destroy it and icebergs in a parody of Asteroids (video game).\n\nWallace and Gromit then enter the last set of levels in the game, finding Feathers has created a Diamond-O-Matic to create diamonds, reminding Wallace of the D-Day poster. Archie accidentally gets sent into the machine, and Gromit must enter the machine, using weapons and tools collected from throughout the game and protect Archie from various threats such as fire and ice, whilst also freeing 3 baby zebras. Eventually, they are able to rescue Archie and go to confront Feathers.\nIn the final boss fight of the game, Wallace is imprisoned in a cell and Gromit must battle Feathers in a giant robot suit, avoiding attacks and then shooting the robot in either the bottom or the eyes with a turnip launcher when vulnerable.\nUpon the robot being defeated, Wallace is freed from his cell and Feathers activates a rocket pack to escape. However, upon reaching the zoo entrance, Feathers is confronted by the parent beavers, pandas, polar bears and zebras before being caged by the elephants and dropping his diamond, which is swiftly picked up by Gromit. Wallace then notes how Feathers won't be troubling them again in a hurry, with the penguin being back in his cell from the end of the Wrong Trousers.\n\nPhotos shown during the credits show Archie celebrating his birthday with his mother at Wallace and Gromit's house.\n\nReception\n\nWallace & Gromit in Project Zoo received \"mixed or average reviews\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n2003 video games\n3D platform games\nBAM!

{"id": "4107796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St.%20Lawrence%20Saints%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey", "title": "St. Lawrence Saints men's ice hockey", "text": "The St. Lawrence Saints Men's Ice Hockey team, colloquially known as the \"Skating Saints\", is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents St. Lawrence University. The Saints are a member of the ECAC Hockey. They have played at Appleton Arena in Canton, New York, since 1951. Prior to the arena's construction, the men's team played outdoors at the current location of Whitman Hall.\n\nHistory\nSince the team's inception in 1925, the Saints men's hockey program has been a competitive team at the top ranks of American college hockey. Due to World War II, there were no teams during the 1941–42 season, or the 1943–44 through 1945–46 seasons.\n\nThe team plays in the ECAC Hockey League, one of six Division I leagues. This league currently boasts six Ivy League teams, including perennial powers Cornell and Harvard as well as six colleges from upstate New York and Connecticut. Since the inception of the ECAC in 1961, SLU has won six ECAC tournament titles and two ECAC regular season titles.\n\nSince the 1951–52 season, SLU has made sixteen NCAA tournament appearances. St. Lawrence has been to the Frozen Four and its antecedent the four team NCAA Championships a total of nine times, playing in the title games in 1961 and 1988. St. Lawrence has accomplished this despite being, at approximately 2,000 students, one of the smallest colleges to play at the Division I level. A Division III school in all other sports, St. Lawrence has maintained Division I \"play-up\" status in hockey thanks to a 2004 NCAA resolution, allowing it (along with 11 other schools) to offer Division I scholarships in only one sport.  St. Lawrence did not offer grant-in-aid hockey scholarships until the mid-1990s.\n\nIn 1988, the Saints played in the NCAA national championship game at the Olympic Arena in Lake Placid, NY, losing to Lake Superior State University 4–3 in overtime. The 1987–88 season was the most successful in team history, with an overall record of 29–9–0. In 2000, the Saints played in the longest NCAA tournament game on record; a 3–2, quadruple overtime victory over Boston University. The win advanced the Saints to the Frozen Four, where the team eventually lost to Boston College in the National Semifinals. The Men's program has produced 28 All-American players, seven ECAC tournament MVPs, six ECAC players of the year, four ECAC rookies of the year, and nine Hobey Baker Memorial Award finalists.\n\nFrom 1985 until 2012, Joe Marsh was the head coach at St. Lawrence. In 2007, he won his 400th Division I game (all at St. Lawrence) placing him in 6th place among active NCAA Division I coaches in career wins. Marsh is a two-time winner of the Spencer Penrose Award given to the best college coach of the year.\n\nFollowing Marsh's retirement in 2012, former Ottawa Senators assistant coach, and Saints alumnus, Greg Carvel took over head coaching duties. In 2016, Carvel departed the program to take the same role at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Following the departure of Carvel, St. Lawrence named former Clarkson University head coach Mark Morris as the 14th head coach in program history.\n\nBeginning with the 2019–20 season, the Saints announced Brent Brekke as the 15th head coach in program history.\n\nSt. Lawrence's biggest hockey rival is Clarkson University, located in Potsdam, ten miles from the St. Lawrence campus. For many years, the swing through the North Country has been considered to be one of the most grueling road trips in college hockey.\n\nSt. Lawrence plays its home hockey games at Appleton Arena, a classic old time hockey barn which has seen many upgrades since opening in 1950 with a 4–2 St. Lawrence win over Dartmouth College.\n\nSeason-by-season results\n\nSource:\n\nRecords vs. current ECAC Hockey teams\nAs of the completion of the 2018–19 season\n\nCoaches\n\nAs of completion of the 2022–23 season\n\n† Leon Abbott resigned in December 1979 and Dale Henwood served as the interim coach for the remainder of the season.\n\nUniforms \nTraditionally, the Saints home jersey is white with scarlet shoulders and brown trim. The end of the sleeves and bottom of the sweater feature scarlet and brown stripes. The school's crest and the player's name and number all appear in scarlet with brown trim. The road jersey are identically designed, but with the white and scarlet portions reversed. In 2002, a lace-up neck was adopted by the men's team.\n\nIn 2001, in honor of Appleton Arena's 50th anniversary, an alternate \"throw-back\" jersey was introduced for the men's team. The alternate jersey is white but does not feature colored shoulders. The StL logo is significantly smaller, and \"St. Lawrence\" is spelled out across the chest. The school seal also appears on both shoulders of the sweater. This jersey continued to be used occasionally until gaining popularity during the 2006–07 season, when the men's team exhibited frequent success when wearing the alternate jerseys on home ice. As a result, the alternate jersey quickly became the staple home jersey.  Beginning with the 2012–13 season, St. Lawrence retired the StL logo from the red road jerseys as well, and adopted a design that matched the home white sweaters.\n\nOriginally, the women's program wore jerseys that were identical to the men's jerseys. However, in fall 2005, the women's jerseys were designed to be unique from the men's jerseys. The scarlet and brown on the shoulders of the home jersey was extended down the arms until it met with the trim at the end of the sleeve. The player's number appears within the scarlet portion and is white with brown trim. The road jerseys feature a similar pattern, but the shoulders and sleeves are brown with white trim (a reverse of the traditional road-jersey scheme) on a red background.\n\nIn tribute to Mike Pelletier and Rich Stewart, teammates on the 1988 NCAA finalist team who were among the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the 2001–02 men's team wore a patch on the shoulder of their jerseys with both players' initials. Pelletier and Stewart had both been employees of Cantor Fitzgerald working in the World Trade Center.\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, St. Lawrence, along with all other ECAC Hockey teams, participated in Coaches vs. Cancer's \"Pink at the Rink\" fundraiser. The Men's team wore black sweaters with pink and white trim while the Women's team wore pink uniforms with white trim. The jerseys, along with pink ties worn by the coaches and pink sticks were then auctioned off to raise funds for breast cancer research. (The Men's team only wore the pink jerseys during warmups, as visiting team Harvard had forgotten to bring their home white jerseys.)\n\nTraditions \n\n Whenever a goal is scored, the crowd will sing \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" immediately after the goal is announced. A skating saint sign at each end of the arena flashes as well.\n When the final minute of the period is announced, fans respond by yelling \"And Clarkson Still Sucks!\" referring to St Lawrence's nearby rival school. This same cheer is often used by fans at Rensselaer, whose rivalry with Clarkson stems from being another engineering school in the ECAC Hockey, and not from geographic location.\n Due to St Lawrence's proximity to Canada, both the American and Canadian national anthems are played prior to home games. Many fans will shout the word \"saints\" over the final word of the American national anthem. This is a shared tradition among schools in the ECAC Hockey; notably Clarkson fans and Cornell fans will shout \"knights\" and \"red,\" respectively, when those words appear in the anthem's lyrics.\n Since the fall of 1999, students have brought a school flag into the stands to wave when team takes the ice and when they score. Cowbells have also become popular among fans (possibly due to the large population of dairy farmers in the region), and are sold at the school's bookstore, with the St. Lawrence University crest printed on them.\n In the early to mid 1990s, when the Saints scored a goal near the student section, some students would lob rubber chickens toward the goal.\n In the early to mid 1990s, many students brought newspapers to the game. During the introduction of the visiting team, students would hold up the newspapers and pretend to read. When the introductions shifted to the Saints, the newspaper was quickly balled up and thrown into the air as the crowd started cheering for the home team.\n In the early to mid 1990s, when penalties to the visiting team were announced over the PA system in the arena, the final part of the announcement would be shouted over.  “Clarkson penalty to number 16. Two minutes for—-“ The crowd would interrupt in unison “for being an a—-hole.”\n\nStatistical Leaders\nSource:\n\nCareer points leaders\n\nCareer goaltending leaders\n\nGP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\n\nMinimum 30 games played\n\nStatistics current through the start of the 2023–24 season.\n\nRoster\nAs of September 19, 2023.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nHockey Hall of Fame\nSource:\n\nBill Torrey (1995)\nBrian McFarlane (1995)\n\nUnited States Hockey Hall of Fame\nSource:\n\nRon Mason (2013)\n\nNCAA\n\nIndividual awards\n\nHobey Baker Award Finalists\n\n Peter Lappin: 1988\n Daniel Laperrière: 1992\n Burke Murphy: 1996\n Eric Heffler: 1999\n Erik Anderson: 2001\n\n T.

With an enrollment of 3,724 students (2022–23), WesternU offers more than twenty academic programs in multiple colleges.\n\nUnder the banner of WesternU Health, the university operates a variety of patient care facilities in California and Oregon. The Pomona and Lebanon (Oregon) campuses both include a medical center, dental center, eye care institute, pharmacy, and travel health center. WesternU-Pomona also is home to the Pet Health Center, which provides veterinary services. Dental services are offered at the Rancho Mirage campus, while a Los Angeles campus provides optometry services.\n\nSeveral nonprofit organizations are based at the WesternU Pomona campus, including the Harris Family Center for Disability and Health Policy. The Center for Oral Health, moved from the Bay area to the WesternU Pomona campus in 2012. In 2015, the Southern California Medical Museum moved to the Pomona campus.\n\nFounded in 1977, the first program at WesternU was its medical school, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific (COMP). In 2003, the College of Veterinary Medicine opened, and in 2009 the colleges of dental medicine, optometry, and podiatric medicine opened. In 2011, the university opened an additional campus in Lebanon, Oregon, the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific - Northwest (COMP-Northwest). In 2015, the university's founding president, Philip Pumerantz, retired. \nAll of the programs at WesternU have professional accreditation and the university is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.\n\nHistory\n\nWesternU was established in 1977 as the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific (COMP), offering the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree (D.O.). This was the first medical school in California to open after a complicated era in the relations of allopathic and osteopathic medicine, notably when the California College of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons - only the second DO school in America - briefly became independent as an M.D. granting school before soon evolving into the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine. Upon its foundation in 1977, the WesternU College of Osteopathic Medicine was the only osteopathic medical school west of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nIn 1986, the college began offering a second degree, the Master of Science in Health Professions Education. Four years later in 1990, the physician assistant program opened, which in 2000 grew into a master's level program. In 1992, the physical therapy program opened.\n\nIn 1996, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges granted accreditation as a full and constituent university, and later that year, what had begun as the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific was renamed the \"Western University of Health Sciences.\" 1996 also saw the foundation of the WesternU College of Pharmacy. In 1998, the university established the Harris Family Center for Disability and Health Policy. In 1997, the College of Graduate Nursing was established with the first online Family Nurse Practitioner program in California, followed by an entry-level master's degree for students with a BA/BS degree who wanted to become a nurse.\n\nThereafter, the veterinary college was founded after some initial hesitancy by the American Veterinary Medical Association's Council on Education, the College of Veterinary Medicine opened in 1998 as the first new veterinary medical school in the United States since 1983. Classes began in 2003, and the college earned full accreditation in 2010.  The college was the first veterinary medical school in the United States to appoint a woman as dean. In 2008, the university opened the Banfield Pet Hospital to the public. In 2014, WesternU assumed sole operation and management of the pet hospital.\n\nIn 2009, three new colleges opened at WesternU: podiatric medicine, optometry, and dentistry. The following year, in 2010, the Patient Care Center opened, offering medical, dental, optometric, podiatric and pharmacy services to the community. In 2011, Western University of Health Sciences opened a new medical school campus in Lebanon, Oregon called the College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific Northwest. In 2012, the Center for Oral Health affiliated with WesternU and moved from the bay area of California to the WesternU campus. The Center for Oral Health is an independent non-profit organization, which focuses on improving oral health.\n\nIn January 2015, WesternU began collaborating with colleagues in Scotland affiliated with the UK National Health Service, assisting in the development of a standardized platform for diabetes care called the Scottish Care Information Diabetes Collaboration.  In October 2015, WesternU opened a Virtual Reality Learning Center to augment the teaching of anatomy across all colleges.  Faculty-led virtual reality technology is used by the schools of dentistry, medicine, veterinary medicine, nursing, pharmacy and health professions.  In 2015, the Southern California Medical Museum opened on the WesternU campus. The same year (2015), Pumerantz retired after 38 years as founding president.  He was succeeded in 2016 by Daniel R. Wilson. In November 2017, WesternU opened an Eye Care Institute in Los Angeles, which specializes in low-vision rehabilitation.\n\nIn 2019, the university received the eighth most applications of any medical school in the United States.  In 2019, U.S. News & World Report ranked it 13th among all US medical schools for the percentage of medical graduates going into primary care residencies. The university is the fourth-largest employer in Pomona, with more than 1,000 employees.\n\nOn July 8, 2020, faculty members voted \"no confidence\" in the university's president and asked him to step down.  They cited a \"lack of transparent communication between faculty members and Wilson, his executive leadership team and the Board of Trustees\" as the reasons for their vote. The university's board of trustees formed an ad hoc committee to these concerns.\n\nOn October 20, 2020, the board of trustees announced that President Wilson will officially step down July 1, 2021.   The board of trustees recognized the president's accomplishments over the past four years and both agreed that \"now is an appropriate time to begin the process of identifying a new leader for WesternU.\"  Faculty welcomed the announcement but are awaiting a promised full report on the investigation's findings. In a second communication on October 21, 2020, the board of trustees announced the formation of a Presidential Transition Communications Committee to plan for a successful transition in leadership while addressing shared governance, transparency, accountability, and communication.\n\nIn December 2020, WesternU purchased a building in Lebanon, Oregon to house a doctor of physical therapy program. The first class of physical therapy students began courses in July 2021. WesternU administered COVID-19 vaccinations at an immunization center located on its Pomona campus.\n\nSylvia Manning became the Interim President of the university under the auspices of the Registry for College and University Presidents, which facilitates interim appointments for senior higher education leaders. The search for a regularly appointed President of WesternU concluded with the selection of Robin Farias-Eisner, who is the third president of the university effective March 1, 2022.\n\nAcademics \n\nThrough its nine colleges, WesternU offers 21 academic programs, each on a semester schedule.  All programs at WesternU are post-baccalaureate and focused on a health sciences profession.  All are accredited by the respective national accrediting body. The university itself is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Doctoral degrees include the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, Doctor of Dental Medicine, Doctor of Optometry, Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, Doctor of Pharmacy, Doctor of Nursing Practice, Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Doctor of Podiatric Medicine.\n\nSeveral Master of Science (MS) programs are also offered in Pharmaceutical Sciences, Health Sciences, Physician Assistant Studies, Nursing, Biomedical Sciences, and Medical Sciences.  A Master of Science in Health Professions Education is offered to provide educational skills to health professionals interested in teaching.  Two distance education programs are offered: the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and Master of Science Nursing (MSN).  All other programs are traditional on-campus programs.  Further Colleges and Programs are in consideration.\n\nAccording to U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges Ranking, of the 188 medical schools evaluated, Western University of Health Sciences is ranked as the 93rd-123rd best medical school in the United States, in terms of both Research and Primary Care.\n\nInterprofessional education\nWesternU operates an Interprofessional Education (IPE) program, involving all nine of its colleges. The program began in 2007 and the first phase was implemented later that year. The program goals are to improve understanding of other health professions and to provide and promote a team approach to patient-centered care and health care management, leading to improved patient care.\n\nAs a part of the interprofessional education program, students meet in small groups with a faculty facilitator and discuss non-clinical aspects of symptom presentation in complex cases, including interprofessional knowledge and awareness, financial or ethical challenges and communication barriers. Augmentation of clinical IPE rotations with grand rounds and journal clubs is ongoing.\n\nResearch\nWesternU   conducts research in an array of areas in basic, translational, and clinical sciences.  Three primary research strengths include: neurobiology, molecular / metabolic diseases, and infectious disease / immunology.  Specific neurobiology subjects include: Alzheimer's disease, central nervous system diseases, genetic disorders, environmental pathologies, and stem cell therapy.  Specific molecular and metabolic disease subjects include: cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.  Research on infections and immunology includes tuberculosis, Mad cow disease, avian flu, and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Research is funded by the National Institute of Health, the OneSight Foundation, The Potts Foundation, American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine.\n\nPatient care and education \n\nWestern University of Health Sciences provides patient care in several locations in California and Oregon. WesternU opened its first patient care center, a family practice clinic, in 1984.  The Pomona Patient Care Center opened in May 2010, and serves more than 10,000 patients per year.  The Patient Care Center includes a Medical Center, Foot & Ankle Center, Eye Care Center, Dental Center and Pharmacy.  The center is also home to an accredited diabetes education center. WesternU is a member of the Association of Academic Health Centers.  The university   also offers  post-graduate residency training in medicine in association with partners throughout the Western states.\n\nThe university operates the Harris Family Center for Disability and Health Policy, and provides consultation and training to organizations, companies, and hospitals to help them meet the needs of disabled individuals.\n\nCampus\n\nPomona campus\n\nThe main campus of WesternU is located in downtown Pomona, California.  Upon the school's founding, a portion of the campus was extensively renovated from an outdoor shopping mall. Since that time, several buildings have been acquired and built, including a patient care center, a pet hospital, classrooms, and research facilities.  There are two parks located on the urban campus.  The Pomona campus consists of 19 major buildings spanning some seven city blocks along the main \"Esplanade,\" which amounts to a total .\n\nThe northeastern corner of campus has the Health Education Center, the Patient Care Center, and a large parking structure. These WesternU buildings opened in 2010, as a part of a $100 million expansion project.  The Health Education Center is a 180,000-square-foot teaching and research facility that also houses the colleges of medical, dentistry, podiatry and optometry.  The fourth floor of the center has state-of-the-art research laboratories.  The seven level parking structure has 600 parking spaces.\n\nDirectly west of the Health Education Center is the WesternU Pet Wellness Center, an on campus pet hospital and clinic.  It had been established in 2008 as the Banfield Pet Hospital and transitioned to solely WesternU operation in 2014. The center provides primary care services such as vaccinations, spaying and neutering, microchiping, surgery, dental exams and cleanings, as well as flea, tick and heartworm control. It includes a surgical suite, an x-ray room, a half dozen exam rooms and isolation facilities.\n\nThe Daumier is a mixed-use building located south of the pet hospital on 3.6 acres at 3rd and Linden Street. This building was completed in June 2014, at cost of $45 million, and serves as a 173,000-square-foot facility primarily for WesternU student housing but with research and educational support space as well as a fitness center, community pool, media room, and other university offices.  The Daumier was designed to LEED gold specifications. The building was named the Daumier after the 19th century French artist Honoré Daumier.\n\nThe central portion of campus contains Ethan Allan Park, the Health Professions Center (HPC), the Veterinary Medicine Center, and the Health Sciences Center.  Ethan Allen Park is located directly west of the Pet Wellness Center.  In 2006, the park was named in honor of Dr. Ethan Allen, founding chairman of the school's board of trustees. The other park on campus is Centennial Park, a Pomona city park on the west end of campus.  Directly south of Ethan Allan Park, the Health Professions Center houses the College of Pharmacy and contains several classrooms, research facilities, and a student commons area.  The building was built in 1962 and was previously the Pomona Buffum's department store.  The university acquired the building in 1992, after first receiving the option to buy.  The Center for Oral Health, a non-profit organization promoting oral health, is based in the Health Professions Center.  The Health Sciences Center, directly west of the Health Professions Center, is a two-story, 72,000-square-foot building with the main anatomy laboratories, a laboratory for osteopathic manipulative medicine, and extensive classroom space.  The physical therapy school is based in this building, as is the tutoring program.  The Health Sciences Center was formerly a Nash Department Store. The university began using the building in 1990, and then purchased it in 1993.\n\nThe western range of campus contains the Rodney P. Wineberg Center, home to research administration and laboratories, in addition to the Pumerantz Library, and Anderson Tower (formerly known as the Chase Bank building).  The Rodney P. Wineberg Center contains 8,550 square feet dedicated to research. The Rodney P. Wineberg Center building was originally a JCPenney.  The multi-story, 35,000-square-foot Pumerantz Library is on the west edge of campus.  The library opened in that space in 2001, after the university acquired the building in 1998.  The building was built in 1929, and previously housed a switching station for the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph company. The Southern California Medical Museum is located in the Nursing Science Center on the WesternU campus.\n\nAnderson Tower demarcates the western edge of campus at Garey avenue and Second Street.  This seven-story, mid-century modern 70,000-square-foot building was built in 1963, and WesternU purchased the building from JP Morgan Chase in September 2013. The same month, WesternU reached an agreement with a power company, Washington Gas, to build 2,688 solar panels on three campus buildings.  The solar panels were completed in February 2014, and will produce more than 1,100 megawatt hours of energy each year.\n\nWesternU-Oregon\n\nThe university also operates a second campus on 50 acres in Lebanon with an official postal address at 200 Mullins Drive.  The first program offered at the Oregon campus is medicine (DO), though additional colleges and programs are planned, starting with the College of Health Sciences' Doctor of Physical Therapy program.\n\nThe Oregon campus is adjacent to Samaritan Health Services Lebanon Community Hospital,  Groundbreaking for the medical school campus began in June 2009, and it opened for classes in August 2011.  The new  building cost about $15 million, and is the main component of a 50-acre medical campus.\n\nStudents\n\nA total of 3,724 students were in attendance at WesternU in the 2022–23 academic year.  The average age of WesternU students is 28 years and 62 percent are female; 38 percent male; 37.2% Asian/Pacific Islander, 34.4% are White/Non-Hispanic, 10.4% Hispanic, 12.1% two or more races, 2.8% black or African-American, and the remaining students are of unknown ethnicity (2.5%).\n\nStudents at WesternU participate in a vast number of campus clubs and an active student government association.  A wide range of professional fraternities are active on campus, including Sigma Sigma Phi, Kappa Psi, Beta Sigma Kappa, Delta Sigma Delta, and Phi Lambda Sigma.\n\nThere is a university theater troupe, \"Sanus\", which hosts regular performance events. In 1985, medical students formed the group \"Sanus,\" the Latin word for \"sanity.\" The students said they used the opportunity to act and perform plays as means of relieving stress. The theater troupe remains active, and students from other colleges also participate.\n\nOther officially recognized student organizations on campus include the following:\n\nPeople\nWesternU employs 333 full-time faculty and 69 part-time faculty.  Some notable alumni and faculty include:\n Clinton E. Adams, DO, Rear Admiral in the US Navy.\n Lee Burnett, D.O. class of 1997, a U.S. Army Colonel and founder of the Student Doctor Network.\n Joseph C. Gambone, DO, author of Essentials of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Gambone Peak on Antarctica was named in his honor in 1970.\n Lawrence B. Harkless, DPM, founding member of the ADA Council on the Diabetic Foot; sometimes described as the \"father of diabetic foot care.\"\n Lee Rogers, professor of podiatry and prior democratic nominee for US Congress in California's 25th district in 2012.\n\nSee also\n\nMedical schools in California\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\nOfficial website\n\n \nDental schools in California\nEducation in Pomona, California\nEducational institutions established in 1977\nNursing schools in California\nOptometry schools in the United States\nPharmacy schools in California\nSchools accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges\nMedical schools in California\nUniversities and colleges in Los Angeles County, California\n1977 establishments in California\nUniversities using Problem-based learning\nBuildings and structures in Pomona, California\nPrivate universities and colleges in California"}

With the Swedish national team she won two Olympic medals, bronze in 2002 and silver in 2006, and two IIHF World Women's Championships bronze medals, in 2005 and 2007. Martin Hasson played in the SDHL with AIK and Linköping HC, in the Russian Women's Hockey League with Tornado Dmitrov, in the NCAA Division I with the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs, in the J20 SuperElit with the Malmö Redhawks’ junior men's team, and in the J18 Allsvenskan with Hammarby IF's junior men's team.\n\nShe was scheduled to make her debut with the Malmö Redhawks of the HockeyAllsvenskan, the second-tier men's league in Sweden, on 8 March 2006, as the first woman to ever play for a professional men's team in Sweden but this move was vetoed by the University of Minnesota Duluth, the U.S. school that had offered her a scholarship to play hockey. This was because the NCAA, the main governing body for U.S. college sports, prohibits athletes at its member schools from having previously played in a professional league, even if they are not paid.\n\nPlaying career\n\nMinor ice hockey\nMartin's first season of organized ice hockey was at the age of 10, and she did not allow a goal during the entire 17-game schedule. Martin made her international debut in November 2000 at the Four Nations Cup. She appeared in one game, a 2–2 tie against Finland.\n\nIn club competition, she is a two-time European women's champion with AIK, in 2004–05 and 2005–06. She was also acclaimed as the top goaltender in the tournament in 2005–06.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota-Duluth\nOn 22 March 2008, Martin and the UMD Bulldogs beat the Wisconsin Badgers 4–0 at the Duluth Entertainment Convention Center arena in Duluth, MN for their fourth NCAA Division I national championship. It was just the second shutout in NCAA women's hockey championship history. Martin made 28 saves in the game and 69 total saves in the Frozen Four championship tournament and was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. She was also named to the All-Tournament Team along with four of her teammates.\n\nOn 19 February 2011, Martin led the Bulldogs to a 9–0 shutout of the St. Cloud State Huskies at Amsoil Arena in Duluth. The win gave Martin 66 wins, a new record for Bulldogs goaltenders. The previous record was held by Martin's former teammate, Riita Schaublin.\n\nOn 3 March 2011, Martin was named the WCHA Goaltender of the Year and was named to the league's All-WCHA Second Team.\n\nIn 2011–12, Martin played with Team Sweden teammates Elin Holmlov and Danijela Rundqvist for Tornado Moscow of the Russian Women's Hockey League.\n\nInternational play\nMartin made her international debut for Sweden at the 2001 Women's World Championship, when she was 15 years old.  She played in two games, as Sweden finished fifth.  She also played for Sweden at the 2002 Winter Olympics, helping them to a third-place finish as a surprise starter for the bronze medal game against Finland.  Martin was selected as the starter for the medal game by a coin toss.  Martin also suited up for Sweden at the Women's World Championships in 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2008, capturing bronze medals in 2007 and 2009.\n\nMartin made her second appearance at the 2006 Winter Olympics.  She was in goal for Sweden when they upset the United States in the semi-final.  Martin recorded 37 saves in a shootout victory, marking the first time the women's gold medal final at the Olympics would not feature a Canada – United States matchup.

{"id": "4107840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim%20Dooley", "title": "Jim Dooley", "text": "James William Dooley (February 8, 1930 – January 8, 2008) was an American football player and coach. He played in the National Football League (NFL) as an end and flanker for the Chicago Bears.\n\nCollege career\nBorn in Stoutsville, Missouri, Dooley grew up in Miami, Florida, and graduated from Miami High School in 1948. He originally wanted to pursue a career in medicine at Vanderbilt University, but attended the nearby University of Miami when head coach Andy Gustafson agreed to have the school pay his way through medical school.\n\nWith the Hurricanes, he played on both sides of the ball and put together an outstanding career, winning All-American honors and was the first player in school history to have his number retired. Possessing great speed, he capped his senior year with four interceptions against Clemson University in the Gator Bowl on New Year's Day and was selected in the first round of the 1952 NFL Draft by the Bears, eighth overall.\n\nPlaying career\nIn his first year in the NFL, Dooley saw little time on offense, but collected five interceptions. In 1953, he became an important part of the team's passing attack with 53 receptions and four touchdowns, showing a flair for faking out defenders while also popularizing the down-and-out pass. After 34 catches and seven touchdowns in 1954, Dooley's career took a detour when he missed much of the next two seasons by serving the U.S. Air Force. He joined the team on November 28, 1956, and played in their final three games, helping the team reach the NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants.\n\nTeaming with fellow wideout Harlon Hill, Dooley hauled in 37 passes, but only reached the end zone once during the 1957 season. He then missed the entire 1958 campaign when he was forced to the sidelines with an ankle injury, but returned in 1959 with 41 catches. After following that performance with 36 receptions in 1960, Dooley made plans to retire, but changed his mind, catching only six passes the following year.\n\nCoaching career\nAfter competing during the 1962 preseason, Dooley officially retired, but he was soon added as an assistant coach. Three years as the team's wide receivers coach were followed in 1966 by his elevation to the role of the team's defensive coordinator. The move followed the departure of George Allen to Los Angeles, with Dooley quickly becoming known for his innovative strategies. These included flip-flopping the team's defensive tackles during that first year, then using five men in the defensive backfield on third down in 1967, which became known as \"the Dooley Shift\" and now is referred to as the nickel defense.\n\nIn February 1968, Dooley was returned to the offensive side of the ball, but that status changed just months later when 73-year-old George Halas announced his retirement as head coach on May 27 due to arthritis. Dooley, 38, was promoted and introduced as head coach the following day.\n\nThe Bears won half of their games that season, but the team collapsed the following year with a franchise-worst  record. The lone win that year came at midseason against the league's other  team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. In November, running back Brian Piccolo was diagnosed with cancer, and died the following \n\nIn 1970, the Bears improved by five games to finish with a  record, and appeared to be on track for major improvement the following year by winning five of their first seven games, including a  victory in week seven over the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys.  However, the second half of the campaign proved to be a disaster, with just one win in the final seven contests, including a  humiliation on Monday Night Football on November 29 to the other Super Bowl participant, the Miami Dolphins. It was the second of five consecutive losses to conclude the season. The inevitable result of the 1971 collapse came a month later when Dooley was fired on December 29, the first Bears coach ever to suffer that fate.\n\nDooley soon signed as the linebacker coach for the Buffalo Bills, but resigned after just one season.  After sitting out the  season, Dooley was named an assistant with the fledgling World Football League's Southern California Sun.  The job came just one week after he had filed for bankruptcy, citing nearly half a million dollars in debts, including $320,000 to former Bear player and assistant Sid Luckman. In a parallel of his personal problems, Dooley's job ended with the financial problems of the league, at which point he went to work for Luckman at Cellucraft, as a national account sales manager for flexible packaging products, for the next five years.\n\nOn October 12, 1981, he was rehired by the Bears as an offensive consultant, a decision that caused conflict with the team's coaching staff, causing them to consider him something of a spy for management.  After the conclusion of the season, Dooley and all the other coaches were dismissed, but the team's new head coach Mike Ditka, who had played under Dooley two decades earlier, hired him to scout game film of upcoming opponents.\n\nDooley flourished in his new job, aiding the Bears's rise and playing a part in their dominating 1985 season that was capped with a 46–10 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX.\n\nIn 1997, he was honored by his alma mater with a spot in the Miami Hurricanes' Ring of Honor.\n\nDeath\nDooley battled amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease) for his last ten years, and died at Lake Forest Hospital in 2008 at age 77. Buried at Rosehill Cemetery in Chicago, he was survived by his wife, daughter, four sons, and 16 grandchildren.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nNFL\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\n1930 births\n2008 deaths\nBuffalo Bills coaches\nBurials at Rosehill Cemetery\nChicago Bears players\nChicago Bears head coaches\nMiami Hurricanes football players\nSouthern California Sun coaches\nNeurological disease deaths in Illinois\nDeaths from motor neuron disease\nMiami Senior High School alumni\nPlayers of American football from Miami\nSports coaches from Miami"}

{"id": "4107858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor%20fabrication%20plant", "title": "Semiconductor fabrication plant", "text": "In the microelectronics industry, a semiconductor fabrication plant (commonly called a fab; sometimes foundry) is a factory for semiconductor device fabrication.\n\nFabs require many expensive devices to function. Estimates put the cost of building a new fab over one billion U.S. dollars with values as high as $3–4 billion not being uncommon. TSMC invested $9.3 billion in its Fab15 300 mm wafer manufacturing facility in Taiwan. The same company estimations suggest that their future fab might cost $20 billion. A foundry model emerged in the 1990s: Foundries that produced their own designs were known as integrated device manufacturers (IDMs). Companies that farmed out manufacturing of their designs to foundries were termed fabless semiconductor companies. Those foundries, which did not create their own designs, were called pure-play semiconductor foundries. \n\nThe central part of a fab is the clean room, an area where the environment is controlled to eliminate all dust, since even a single speck can ruin a microcircuit, which has nanoscale features much smaller than dust particles.  The clean room must also be damped against vibration to enable nanometer-scale alignment of machines and must be kept within narrow bands of temperature and humidity. Vibration control may be achieved by using deep piles in the cleanroom's foundation that anchor the cleanroom to the bedrock, careful selection of the construction site, and/or using vibration dampers. Controlling temperature and humidity is critical for minimizing static electricity. Corona discharge sources can also be used to reduce static electricity.  Often, a fab will be constructed in the following manner: (from top to bottom): the roof, which may contain air handling equipment that draws, purifies and cools outside air, an air plenum for distributing the air to several floor-mounted fan filter units, which are also part of the cleanroom's ceiling, the cleanroom itself, which may or may not have more than one story,  a return air plenum, the clean subfab that may contain support equipment for the machines in the cleanroom such as chemical delivery, purification, recycling and destruction systems, and the ground floor, that may contain electrical equipment. Fabs also often have some  office space. \n\nThe clean room is where all fabrication takes place and contains the machinery for integrated circuit production such as steppers and/or scanners for photolithography, in addition to etching, cleaning, doping and dicing machines.  All these devices are extremely precise and thus extremely expensive. Prices for most common pieces of equipment for the processing of 300 mm wafers range from $700,000 to upwards of $4,000,000 each with a few pieces of equipment reaching as high as $340,000,000 each (e.g. EUV scanners). A typical fab will have several hundred equipment items.\n\nHistory\nTypically an advance in chip-making technology requires a completely new fab to be built. In the past, the equipment to outfit a fab was not very expensive and there were a huge number of smaller fabs producing chips in small quantities. However, the cost of the most up-to-date equipment has since grown to the point where a new fab can cost several billion dollars.\n\nAnother side effect of the cost has been the challenge to make use of older fabs. For many companies these older fabs are useful for producing designs for unique markets, such as embedded processors, flash memory, and microcontrollers. However, for companies with more limited product lines, it is often best to either rent out the fab, or close it entirely. This is due to the tendency of the cost of upgrading an existing fab to produce devices requiring newer technology to exceed the cost of a completely new fab.\n\nThere has been a trend to produce ever larger wafers, so each process step is being performed on more and more chips at once. The goal is to spread production costs (chemicals, fab time) over a larger number of saleable chips.  It is impossible (or at least impracticable) to retrofit machinery to handle larger wafers.  This is not to say that foundries using smaller wafers are necessarily obsolete; older foundries can be cheaper to operate, have higher yields for simple chips and still be productive.\n\nThe industry was aiming to move from the state-of-the-art wafer size 300 mm (12 in) to 450 mm by 2018. In March 2014, Intel expected 450 mm deployment by 2020. But in 2016, corresponding joint research efforts were stopped.\n\nAdditionally, there is a large push to completely automate the production of semiconductor chips from beginning to end. This is often referred to as the \"lights-out fab\" concept.\n\nThe International Sematech Manufacturing Initiative (ISMI), an  extension of the US consortium SEMATECH, is sponsoring the  \"300 mm Prime\" initiative.  An important goal of this initiative is to enable fabs to produce greater quantities of smaller chips as a response to shorter lifecycles seen in consumer electronics.  The logic is that such a fab can produce smaller lots more easily and can efficiently switch its production to supply chips for a variety of new electronic devices.  Another important goal is to reduce the waiting time between processing steps.\n\nSee also\n\nFoundry model for the business aspects of foundries and fabless companies\nKlaiber's law\nList of semiconductor fabrication plants\nRock's law\nSemiconductor consolidation\nSemiconductor device fabrication for the process of manufacturing devices\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Handbook of Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology, Second Edition by Robert Doering and Yoshio Nishi (Hardcover – Jul 9, 2007)\n Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology by Michael Quirk and Julian Serda (paperback – Nov 19, 2000)\n Fundamentals of Semiconductor Manufacturing and Process Control by Gary S.

Bennett, CM, MBE (April 1, 1890 – April 26, 1990) born London, England, died Daniel's Harbour, Newfoundland, Canada was a celebrated Canadian nurse.  Dubbed The Florence Nightingale of Newfoundland by the Evening Telegram, in tribute to her contribution to the people of the Great Northern Peninsula, she was also known simply as The Nurse.\n\nEarly life \nBennett (née Grimsley) worked as a tailor in London before training as a nurse at Woolwich during the first World War. She later studied midwifery at Clapham School of Midwifery. She came to Newfoundland as a district nurse under the outport nursing scheme. Her plan was to travel to Saskatchewan but was approached by Lady Harris (wife of Sir Alexander Harris) and was made aware of the dire need for nurses in Newfoundland. She agreed and changed her plans to go to Daniel's Harbour in May 1921, at the age of 31. She stayed in Daniel's Harbour and started a family.\n\nCareer \nMyra quickly gained experience caring for the sick on the west coast of Newfoundland. In these areas of Newfoundland (like Parsons Pond) there were no hospitals or doctors available. Myra often made news headlines, often referred to as \"Nurse Bennett of the Outports\". She was known for being especially passionate and resourceful in the rural areas in which she worked. There are stories recorded that show the great distances Bennett would travel to get to her patients. When the need for hospitals was clear to Bennett she transformed her house into a hospital with the help and support of her 3 kids and husband.\n\nHer work in Newfoundland encouraged the construction of new hospitals in Bonne Bay, Port Saunders and St. Anthony's.\n\nThe house that she lived in at Daniel's Harbour is now a heritage site.\n\nAwards and honours \n 1935 - King George V Silver Jubilee Medal\n 1937 - King George VI Coronation Medal\n1946 - Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire\n 195? - Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal\n 1967 - Honorary membership in the Association for Registered Nurses of Newfoundland\n 1974 - Member of the Order of Canada\n 1974 - Doctor of Science, Honoris Causa, Memorial University of Newfoundland\n\nLegacy \n\n Bennett's life as a nurse in outport Newfoundland was written in an article by Reader's Digest and a book entitled Don't Have Your Baby in the Dory by H. Gordon Green. \n CBC TV also did a documentary on her life story, as well as, an interview with Peter Gzowski. \n She is also the subject of Robert Chafe's play Tempting Providence (Playwrights Canada Press, 2004).\n She tells stories of her time as a nurse in Weekend Magazine's article Nurse Bennett of The Outports by Cyril Robinson.\n\nSee also\n\n List of people of Newfoundland and Labrador\n List of communities in Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nReferences \n\n1890 births\n1990 deaths\nCanadian nurses\nCanadian women nurses\nCanadian centenarians\nCanadian Members of the Order of the British Empire\nDominion of Newfoundland people\nMembers of the Order of Canada\nWomen centenarians"}

From 2015 to 2020, the schools were operated by nonprofit Zenith Education Group, after former for-profit owner Corinthian Colleges shut down its operations. It was founded in 1940 as Fort Lauderdale College of Business and Finance and later known as the Florida Metropolitan University, a name it held until 2010. The Florida-based university offered online courses for students throughout the country. Programs focused on career orientation, offering day, night, weekend and online programs for working adults, with programs and schedules varying by campus.\n\nHistory\nFounded as Fort Lauderdale College of Business and Finance in 1940, the College was renamed Fort Lauderdale College in 1976. Another name change created the Florida Metropolitan University.  The three remaining schools are branded as Altierus Career College.\n\nOperation by Corinthian Colleges\nIn 2006, an arbitration process ruled in favor of FMU/Everest and a lawsuit regarding transfer of credits dating to 2004 was dismissed.\n\nIn August 2007, an investigation of company practices was closed by the State of Florida with no fines, penalties, or finding of wrongdoing.  The investigation inquired into FMU's \"advertising, marketing and business practices related to the sale of educational services to Florida Residents.\"  The resulting assurance of voluntary compliance between FMU and the Florida Office of the Attorney General indicated that FMU would pay $99,900 to the Office of the Attorney General for its investigation and in contributions to various consumer education purposes. It indicated that FMU would \"modify\" its pre-enrollment documents to include \"Clear and Conspicuous\" language regarding credit transfer, its refund policy, and its tuition costs, among other stipulations that, in part, serve to \"better train\" its teaching personnel to meet certain student needs. The Assurance of Voluntary Compliance found that FMU/Everest participates in the Florida Statewide Course Numbering System to facilitate the transfer of eligible credits to other institutions. Everest University's previous parent company, Corinthian Colleges, is currently being sued by the state of California for \"false and predatory advertising, intentional misrepresentations to students, securities fraud and unlawful use of military seals in advertisements.\"\n\n\"According to (California Attorney General) Harris' complaint, CCI's predatory marketing efforts specifically target vulnerable, low-income job seekers and single parents who have annual incomes near the federal poverty line. In internal company documents obtained by the Department of Justice, CCI describes its target demographic as 'isolated,' 'impatient,' individuals with 'low self-esteem,' who have 'few people in their lives who care about them' and who are 'stuck' and 'unable to see and plan well for future.' It is alleged the schools targeted people meeting these targets through aggressive and persistent internet and telemarketing campaigns and through television ads on daytime shows like Jerry Springer and Maury Povich.\"\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Everest faced site shutdowns as a result of low job placement rates.\n\nIn November 2013, Corinthian Colleges reported that they were under investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nOperation by Zenith Education\nIn February 2015, ECMC, a non-profit education firm, took ownership of more than half of Corinthian Colleges' campuses. ECMC also agreed to forgive student debt on Corinthian College's Genesis loans after a series of years.\n\nZenith Education Group, a newly created nonprofit provider of career school training, announced in February 2015 that it had finalized its acquisition of more than 50 Everest and WyoTech campuses from Corinthian Colleges Inc., a transaction that was first announced in November. The deal will allow nearly 30,000 students to pursue their career goals without disruption, and will give those students the opportunity to complete their education under new management that is set to implement a new plan to improve the education of its students.\n\nEverest University is now known as Altierus Career College and Career Education. Their program offerings are now limited to associate degrees and career diplomas in Health Care, Trades, Technical, and Business areas.\n\nCampuses\n Houston\n Norcross, Georgia\n Tampa\n\nAccreditation and credit transfer\nEverest University lacks regional or national accreditation. The Everest University campuses in Florida were formerly accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) to award diplomas, associate, bachelor's and master's degrees. However, in 2016 the United States Secretary of Education denied ACICS's accrediting status for failing to meet 21 recognition criteria.\n\nSome of the programs offered at Everest University included:\n Accounting\n Applied Management (AS)\n Business (BS)\n Computer Information Science\n Criminal Investigations\n Criminal Justice Bachelors\n Education & Family (grades K–8)\n Master of Business Administration\n Master of Science in Criminal Justice\n Medical Assistant\n Medical Insurance Billing and Coding\n Paralegal\n\nEverest University was accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS), which was a formerly recognized accrediting agency by the United States Department of Education. The decision whether to grant transfer credit is left to a post-secondary institution's discretion.\n\nMany regionally accredited universities do not accept credits earned at colleges such as Everest which lack regional accreditation.\n\nEverest University participated in Florida's optional credit transfer program, the Florida Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). SCNS was established to facilitate the transfer of students and credits between Florida's public postsecondary educational institutions and participating nonpublic educational institutions, such as Everest University. \"Courses that have the same academic content and are taught by faculty with comparable credentials are given the same prefix and number, and are considered equivalent courses. Equivalent courses are guaranteed to transfer to any other institution participating in SCNS, and the credit awarded for these equivalent courses will satisfy the receiving institution's institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students.\" All Florida public universities and colleges participate in SCNS as well as numerous career/technical education centers and nonpublic institutions, such as Everest University. On August 24, 2010, Everest University had 709 courses listed on SCNS.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nPrivate universities and colleges in Florida\nColleges accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools\nCorinthian Colleges\nFormer for-profit universities and colleges in the United States\n1940 establishments in Florida\nUniversities and colleges established in 1940"}

The submarine is the only surviving example of the class, having been a memorial and museum ship since 1981.\n\nThe Amphion-class submarines were designed for use in the Far East, where the size of the Pacific Ocean made long-range, high surface speed and relative comfort for the crew important features to allow for much larger patrol areas and longer periods at sea than British submarines operating in the Atlantic or Mediterranean had to contend with. Alliance was one of the seven A-class boats completed with a snort mast - the other boats all had masts fitted by 1949.\n\nHistory\n\nFrom 9 October 1947 until 8 November the submarine undertook a lengthy experimental cruise in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa to investigate the limits of the snort mast, remaining submerged for 30 days.\n\nBetween 1958 and 1960 Alliance was extensively modernised by having the deck gun and external torpedo tubes removed, the hull streamlined and the fin replaced with a larger (26 feet 6 inch high), more streamlined one constructed of aluminium.  The purpose of these modifications was to make the submarine quieter and faster underwater. Following the modifications, the wireless transmitting aerial was supported on a frame behind the fin but was later replaced with a whip aerial on the starboard side of the fin which could be rotated hydraulically to a horizontal position.\n\nThe original gun access hatch was retained, however, allowing Alliance to be equipped with a small calibre deck gun again when serving in the Far East during the Indonesian Confrontation of the earlier 1960s.\n\nIn May 1961 the pennant numbers of British submarines were changed so that all surviving submarines completed after the Second World War were now numbered from S01 upwards, and Alliance was given the number S67.\n\nOn 13 January 1968, she grounded on Bembridge Ledge off the Isle of Wight, but was subsequently refloated with the help of Admiralty tugs. On or around 30 September 1971, a battery explosion occurred on board, while she was at Portland Harbour, which killed one sailor and injured 14 others.\n\nFrom 1973 until 1979 she was the static training boat at the shore establishment HMS Dolphin, replacing  in this role. In August 1979, she was towed to Vosper Ship Repairers Limited's yard at Southampton to have her keel strengthened so that she could be lifted out of the water and preserved as a memorial to those British submariners who have died in service.  Since 1981 the submarine has been a museum ship, raised out of the water and on display at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum in Gosport.\n\nAlthough listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, in recent years as many as 100 pigeons had been nesting in the submarine, causing extensive corrosive damage.  She also sat on cradles over seawater, adding to problems of corrosion and preventing easy and economical maintenance to her exterior.   Urgent repairs were needed and it was announced on 30 May 2011 that HMS Alliance would share in an £11 million Heritage Lottery Fund grant. Alliance would receive £3.4 million to repair her bow and stern and address extensive surface corrosion.  The restoration included reclaiming land beneath HMS Alliance using a cofferdam and backfill. This provides easy access for future maintenance and a  new viewing platform for visitors, additionally opening up the conning tower and casing.

Its plot follows a young boy who moves into a former plantation in Louisiana, and encounters the ghost of a young girl who was murdered on the property.\n\nIt originally aired on NBC as a presentation of The Wonderful World of Disney on May 14, 1978. The film was also re-aired sporadically during the early to mid-1980s, often on weekends during the afternoon. The filming locations were in Danville, Kentucky and New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nPlot\nAlexander Armsworth and his family move into an antebellum Louisiana plantation. Alexander's mother and sister become set on restoring the home to its former glory, but Alexander is unsettled by the mysterious lights he sees around the property. He also meets his new neighbor, Blossom Culp, a superstitious girl raised by her spiritualist aunt. In spite of Blossom's strange and sometimes annoying ways, she becomes a loyal friend.\n\nOne night Alexander sees the mysterious lights once more and follows them into the old barn, where he finds the ghost of a young Creole girl, Inez Dumaine, and her dog. Inez's uncle was the notorious pirate Jacques Dumaine, former owner of the plantation. In life, Inez refused to reveal the location of her family's fortune to Jacques, who murdered her and her dog by throwing them down the well in the barn. As revenge, he cursed her ghost to remain on the property. In order to be free of the curse, Inez must solve a riddle and begs Alexander to help her, while warning him that if the riddle is not solved before All Saints' Eve (Halloween), she will be trapped forever and forced to reenact her murder every night. The riddle states:\n\nSleeping lies the murdered lass.Vainly cries the child of glass.When the two shall be as one,the spirit's journey will be done.\n\nWhen he realizes that Inez herself must be \"the murdered lass,\" Alexander enlists Blossom and her grandmother to find the \"child of glass.\" In a vision using Blossom's crystal ball, Alexander sees Inez alive with her mother, who makes Inez promise to look after her china doll Babette. Waking from the vision, Alexander realizes that the doll Babette must be the \"child of glass.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Alexander's mother fires a disgruntled handyman, Amory Timmons, who burns down the barn as revenge. Alexander witnesses the fire and Amory attempts to murder him. Alexander escapes by running into the burning barn, but falls into the old well. Roused by the barn fire, Alexander's family realize that he is missing, while Amory has escaped. As the police search for Alexander and Amory, Inez's dog leads Blossom to the well house, where she sees the unconscious Alexander on a ledge. Blossom is the only one light enough to be lowered down the well to tie a rope to Alexander. While doing so, she discovers Babette on the same ledge. Both Alexander and the doll are taken safely from the well.\n\nAlexander and Blossom located Inez's family tomb and lay the doll on her grave, freeing her from the curse. However, Amory tracks Alexander and Blossom to the tomb and is on the verge of killing them both when Inez manifests as a terrifying, wailing ghost that scares him into fleeing. Inez thanks Alexander and Blossom for their help before going to her final rest. Before Inez departs forever, the doll rises from the grave and smashes on the floor, revealing that its head is full of diamonds—the long-lost Dumaine treasure that Inez was sworn to protect. Inez has given Alexander the treasure to help his family restore her home.\n\nCast\nBarbara Barrie as Emily Armsworth \nBiff McGuire as Joe Armsworth \nAnthony Zerbe as Amory Timmons\nNina Foch as Aunt Lavinia Culp \nKaty Kurtzman as Blossom Culp \nSteve Shaw as Alexander Armsworth \nOlivia Barash as Inez Dumaine \nDenise Nickerson as Connie Sue Armsworth \nJack Rader as Sheriff Muncey \nIrene Tedrow as Miss Merryweather \nLilyan Chauvin as Madame Dumaine \nDavid Hurst as Jacques Dumaine \nSue Ann Gilfillan as Ludee Calhoun\n\nFilming\nThe film was shot on location in Danville, Kentucky in August 1977. For the scene in which the exterior barn burns, the production used pyrotechnics to burn a real barn that was purchased from a local man, dismantled, and relocated to a different site where it was reassembled.\n\nThe graveyard scenes were filmed in Bellevue Cemetery in Danville, but there was no appropriate tomb for the final scene, therefore one was built in the cemetery. The set remained a popular tourist attraction for years afterwards.\n\nHome media\nDisney released the film on VHS in early 1987 and a DVD-on-Demand version of this film as part of their Disney Generations Collection line of DVDs on December 5, 2011.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nChild of Glass DVD\n\n1978 television films\n1978 films\n1970s ghost films\n1970s fantasy films\nAmerican fantasy films\nAmerican ghost films\nAmerican haunted house films\nFilms directed by John Erman\nFilms produced by Ron W.

{"id": "4107919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship%20of%20teaching%20and%20learning", "title": "Scholarship of teaching and learning", "text": "The scholarship of teaching and learning (SOTL or SoTL) is often defined as systematic inquiry into student learning which advances the practice of teaching in higher education by making inquiry findings public. Building on this definition, Peter Felten identified 5 principles for good practice in SOTL: (1) inquiry focused on student learning, (2) grounded in context, (3) methodologically sound, (4) conducted in partnership with students, (5) appropriately public.\n\nSOTL necessarily builds on many past traditions in higher education, including classroom and program assessment, action research, the reflective practice movement, peer review of teaching, traditional educational research, and faculty development efforts to enhance teaching and learning. As such, SOTL encompasses aspects of professional development or faculty development, such as how teachers can not only improve their expertise in their fields, but also develop their pedagogical expertise, i.e., how to better teach novice students in the field or enable their learning. It also encompasses the study and implementation of more modern teaching methods, such as active learning, cooperative learning, problem based learning, and others. SOTL scholars come from various backgrounds, such as those in educational psychology and other education related fields, as well as  specialists in various disciplines who are interested in improving teaching and learning in their respective fields. Some scholars are educational researchers or consultants affiliated with teaching and learning centers at universities.\n\nInquiry methods in SOTL include reflection and analysis, interviews and focus groups, questionnaires and surveys, content analysis of text, secondary analysis of existing data, quasi-experiments (comparison of two sections of the same course), observational research, and case studies, among others. As with all scholarly study, evidence depends not only upon the methods chosen but the relevant disciplinary standards. Dissemination for impact among scholarly teachers may be local within the academic department, college or university, or may be in published, peer-reviewed form. A few journals exclusively publish SOTL outputs, and numerous disciplinary publications disseminate such inquiry outputs (e.g., J. Chem. Educ., J. Natural Resour. Life Sci. Educ., Research in the Teaching of English, College English, J. Economic Education), as well as a number of core SoTL journals and newsletters.\n\nRelated frameworks\nRelated to SoTL are Discipline-Based Educational Research (DBER) and Decoding the Disciplines. DBER differs from the more general SoTL concept in that it is closely linked to specific subject areas, such as physics or mathematics. This is often reflected in very subject-specific questions, and actors in this research area also often have a subject background rather than a pedagogical one.\n\nClosely related to SoTL is also the Decoding the Disciplines approach, which aims more at making the tacit knowledge of experts explicit and helping students master mental actions.\n\nSignature pedagogies \n\nSignature pedagogies are ways of learning in specific disciplines. Examples of signature pedagogies include medical residents making rounds in hospitals or pre-service teachers doing a classroom-based practicum as part of their teacher training. The notion of signature pedagogies has expanded in recent years, as scholars have examined their use in e-learning, for example. Some scholars contend that SoTL itself is a signature pedagogy of higher education.\n\n4M Framework \nIt has been suggested that the role of SoTL is evolving, but there remains a need to demonstrate the impact of efforts to promote the impact of SoTL within higher education. The 4M framework is used in SoTL to understand complex problems relating to teaching and learning. The framework grew out of systems theory and has been adapted for used in educational settings. The framework includes four levels through which complex problems can be studied: micro (individual), meso (departmental), macro (institutional), and mega. Changes at the meso-level and beyond can have the most impact over time. The framework has been proposed as a means to engage in strategic planning and institutional reporting of SoTL activities.\n\nProfessional societies \n\nThe International Society for Exploring Teaching and Learning (ISETL) has as its purpose \"to encourage the study of instruction and principles of learning in order to implement practical, effective methods of teaching and learning; promote the application, development, and evaluation of such methods; and foster the scholarship of teaching and learning among practicing post-secondary educators.\" They hold a yearly conference in varying locations. Their 50th annual conference was to be held in Charlotte, NC in 2019.\n\nThe International Society for the Scholarship of Teaching & Learning (ISSOTL) was founded in 2004 by a committee of 67 scholars from several countries and serves faculty members, staff, and students who care about teaching and learning as serious intellectual work. ISSOTL has held annual conferences since 2004, attended by scholars from about a dozen nations.  The conferences sites include Bloomington, Indiana USA (2004); Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (2005); Washington, DC, USA (2006); Sydney, Australia (2007); Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (2008); Bloomington, Indiana, USA (2009); Liverpool, UK (2010); Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA (2011); Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (2012); Raleigh, North Carolina, USA (2013); Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (2014).\n\nThere are also stand-alone conferences that have a long-standing commitment to SOTL. The Lilly Conferences are a series of conferences that occur multiple times a year and provide \"opportunities for the presentation of the scholarship of teaching and learning.\" Additionally, The SoTL Commons Conference is an international conference that has been held since 2007 at the Georgia Southern University Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE).\n\nCriticism and limitations of SoTL \nSome writers have been critical of SoTL as lacking focus and definition with a lack of clarity on the differences between SoTL and Educational Research undertaken in tertiary education. It is also argued that SoTL has become too broad in definition and is conflated with non-evidenced based teaching interventions and innovations.  Macfarlane claims SoTL damages the reputation of educational research, reinforcing a long-standing notion that educational research is of lower status compared to discipline-based research.\n\nList of journals focusing on SOTL topics \n \nThe Canadian Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning\nCollege Teaching\nInternational Journal for Academic Development\nInternational Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (IJ-SOTL)\nInternational Journal for Students as Partners (IJSaP)\nInternational Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education (IJTLHE)\nJournal of Effective Teaching in Higher Education (Formerly Journal of Effective Teaching)\nJournal of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning \nJournal on Excellence in College Teaching\nTeaching & Learning Inquiry (TLI)\n\nSee also\n Education research\n Education science\n National Survey of Student Engagement\n Pedagogy\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Bass, R. 1999. \"The scholarship of teaching: What is the problem?\" Creative Thinking about Learning and Teaching 1(1). online – online \n Boyer, E.

{"id": "4107927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hille%2C%20Germany", "title": "Hille, Germany", "text": "Hille is a community in the Kreis Minden-Lübbecke in the north of East Westphalia, Germany, with approximately 16,000 inhabitants. It was created in 1973 in the framework of the community restructuring of North Rhine-Westphalia through the combining of nine communities of the Minden countryside.  The community is named after Hille its largest village.   The geography of the community belongs to that of the North German Plain, from its lowest altitude of 45 metres it rises to 251 metres on the ridge of the Wiehengebirge at its southern border.\n\nGeography\nHille is located in the northeast of the Detmold (region), in the middle of the Minden Land.  Hille has portions of the ecologic areas of the Wiehen Hills, the Lübbecke Loess Country and the Rahden-Diepenauer Sandy Moorlands (boglands).  The southern portion of the community is located in the transition zone from the North Germain Plain to the Central Uplands (piedmont).  This especially apparent with the ridgelike structure of the Wiehengebirge, which closes Hille like a bolt from the Ravensberg hill country.  The main part of the northerly bench of the community is clearly a component of the plain, which received its endmoraine character from the Ice Age.  The Great Peatbog (Grosses Torfmoor) provides Hille with a wet ecosystem of glacial origin which has been a designated nature reserve since 1980.  This is where rare plants and animals such as white storks are found.  Hille is the source of the Ösper, a tributary of the River Weser.  The Mittelland Canal crosses Hille at its geographic middle in an east–west orientation. Several settlements adhere to the canal's adjacent dry northern plateau.  To the north are a large raised bog and the Minden Forest (Mindener Wald).  The River Weser presents a geographic border 10 km east of Hille.  To the west the same landscape continues all the way to Osnabrück.  The varied farmland is characterized by scattered settlements and single farms that are bordered by copses and hedges.  Forests are found on higher ground, while meadows are found at low ground and in bogs.\n\nNeighbouring municipalities\n Petershagen\n Minden\n Bad Oeynhausen\n Hüllhorst\n Lübbecke\n Espelkamp\n Uchte in Lower Saxony\n\nSubdivisions of the municipality \nAfter the local government reforms of 1973, Hille consists of 9 districts:\n Hille-Dorf\n Hartum\n Nordhemmern\n Holzhausen II\n Südhemmern\n Eickhorst\n Rothenuffeln\n Oberlübbe\n Unterlübbe\n\nGeology\nThe community land formation was primary influenced by the Saalian Stage (Wolstonian Stage and Illinoian Stage are Equivalents) ice age, as well as pre and post glacial process.  At the time the area was covered with ice, the flow of water had an opposite direction to that of the present, that is it flowed from the ice to the south, collected  in a riverine environment north of the Wiehengebirge and flowed to the west to reach the sea.  Extensive wet bogs were created in this historic river valley, that remained impassable for humans for a long time.  Remains of this exist in the Great Peat Bog (Große Torfmoor) that is now a protected nature preserve.\n\nSoils\nThe mentioned glacial conditions created various fertilities of soil, with varying impact on the structure of settlement.  As a result, there is fertile soil in the south between the Wiehengebirge and the Bastau lowland, which is referred to as Lübbecke Loessland.  Besides the settlement of Rothenuffeln, the villages of Oberlübbe, Unterlübbe and Eickhorst developed here.  The Bastau lowland connects to the north, in which there can be no significant agriculture.  Because of this the Mittellandkanal is located at its northern edge.  The Hartume loess plate lies to the Northeast of the Bastau lowland, where there are good opportunities for agriculture.  The villages of Hartum, Nordhemmern, Südhemmern and Holzhausen II are located here.  The farmsteads are of middling size with 100 morgen(1 morgen = 3 acres) not being uncommon.  This loess plate continues to the westward beyond the stream Flöthe, where the village of Hille is the center of settlement.  The northeast of the community of Hille has poor soil that allows only forestry( Mindener Wald) to exist.\n\nFauna\nThe white stork nests in and around the Bastau lowland, with assistance provided for its recovering population.\n\nExtent and utilization of the Community Area\nHille is classified as a \"large rural community\" that lies in the North German Plain, it rises to the ridge of the Wiehengebirge in the south.  The Lübber Berg (mountain) is its highest point at an altitude of 251m over sea level.  The lowest point is in the Bastau lowland meadows or bogs near Hartum with an altitude of only 47.7m.  Hille extends 11.8 km from east to west and 15.4 km from north to south.\n\nHistory\nHille was and is influenced by its agricultural character. Besides the large farms, which grew because of the good loess soil of the Hartumer Loess Plate, there were many small homes for contract workers into the 19th century. The contract workers earned a supplemental income through manual labor such as the weaving of linen. Cigarmaking arrived in Hille at the end of the 19th century. Especially toward the end of the 19th century many residents of the Hille villages emigrated to the USA. Their goal was mostly the state of New York and especially the city of Schenectady. Men from Hille also travelled by foot to the Netherlands for seasonal work such as mowing grass. Many of them remained there.\n\nAround the middle of the 19th century, the transportation infrastructure became significantly enhanced by road construction under the leadership of Carl von Schlotheim who was Land Councilor in the Prussian Kreis Minden. While the primary goal of this program was job creation, it served to boost the economy of the Kreis. The railroad reached this rural region in the early 20th century. The Mindener Kreisbahnen opened a stretch of narrow gauge line to Eickhorst in 1903. The line was extended to Lübbecke in 1907. It was converted to standard gauge at a later time. The objective of this Prussian improvement was rural area development: transport of chemical fertilizer, transport of agricultural products to Minden and Lübbecke and further transport from there to other cities by the State railway. The construction of the Mindener Kreisbahn was also a good job creator, with thousands of workers earning their bread and keep. The stretch from Hille to Lübbecke was shut down in 1967 and subsequently demolished. Freight service still exists between the harbour at the village of Hille and the city of Minden. Even Oberlübbe had a narrow gauge railway connection from 1897 to 1937. The so-called \"Wallücker Willem\" connected the quarry mine near Wallücke in the Wiehengebirge with Löhne and Kirchlengern to the south. It transported passengers as well as iron ore over the mountain ridge.\n\nHiller Platt, a dialect of Low German, was spoken by most residents into recent times. It had considerable variation from village to village. The use of this language has declined significantly.\n\nCommunity restructuring\nThe larger community of Hille was created on January 1, 1973 as a response to the Bielefeld-Gezetz(law) in the framework of the community reform of North Rhine-Westfalia. This united the heretofore independent communities of Eickhorst, Hartum, Hille, Holzhausen II, Nordhemmern und Südhemmern from the old Amt Hartum as well as the communities of Oberlübbe, Rothenuffeln und Unterlübbe from the old Amt Dützen. In contrast several peripheral sections of Holzhausen II and Hartum were shifted to the city of Minden while corridor sections of the old community Hahlen were added to larger Hille.   \nAmt Hartum and Amt Dützen were dissolved; the community of Hille is the legal successor of Amt Hartum. The community town hall is the building formerly housing Amt Hartum, which has a reasonably accessible location to the larger community.\n\nDemographics\nThe following overview shows the census of the community of Hille according to the contemporary extent of borders.  The numbers cover the time to 1970 and for 1987 for census results [6][7][8] and since 1975 for official projections made by the Statistic Bureau of the State of North Rhine- Westfalia. [9]  The numbers for 1975, 1980, and 1985 are estimates, the numbers since 1990 are projections of the 1987 census.  The results up to 1985 are  residents of living quarters and since 1987 are residents of the primary domicile.\n\n1 Population in the 1973 founded Community Hille\n\nReligion\nAll villages in Hille became Lutheran with the introduction of the Reformation along with the city of Minden in 1550.  The parishes exist to the present day. When the area was ceded to Prussia, the regional church became the Evangelical Church in Prussia in 1817 (Evangelical Church of Westphalia since 1945), which considers itself united in administration, that is to say comprising Lutheran, Reformed and congregations of united belief. The parishes are now partly combined with one parish serving several villages.  A part of the old church owned buildings was transferred to other uses and replaced by newer buildings, for example the parsonage of the village of Hille.  The acceptance of the refugees of World War II resulted in the formation of Catholic parishes, which is slowly changing the milieu to one of multiple beliefs.\n\nGovernance\n\nCommunity Council (Gemeinderat)\nSince the community elections of 1999 the town council of Hille has 32 seats besides the mayor.  The representatives of the FWG Party and the Green Party(Grünen)have joined into one coalition.\n\nThe members of the community council are elected for a term of 5 years.  The next election will take place in 2014.  Until the community elections of 1999, the office of mayor was honorary but was a member of the community council, with a Community Administrator (Gemeindedirector) leading the community administration.\n\nThe following table shows the community election results since 1975:\n\nMayor (Bürgermeister) \n\nThe former Community Administrator (Gemeindedirector) Reinhard Jasper was elected mayor in a 1999 runoff election with 52.44% of the vote versus Friedrich Meyer of the SPD Party.  He succeeded former mayor Günter Grannemann (SPD).  In the 2004 Community election, Reinhard Jasper was re-elected on the first ballot against the First Councilmember Klaus-Herman Pörtner (SPD) with 53.88% of the vote.  Reinhard Jasper retired from his duties as mayor of Hille on September 30, 2008.  He reached this decision in response to allegations that he had utilized community workers in his own home during their work-hours.  The criminal court in Minden levied a fine of 9600 Euros against the mayor, which he has appealed. Since October 1, 2008 the administrative leadership has been provided by the mayoral representative, Helmut Spilker.\n\nCommunity Administrators (Gemeindedirektoren)\nUntil 1999 the administration of the community of Hille was led by an executive community administrator, who was elected by the community council (Gemeinderat).   Wilhelm Grote, the former Director of the dissolved Amt Hartum, was elected as the first community administrator in 1973.  He fulfilled these duties until his retirement in 1987.  Reinhard Jasper first won the office through the drawing of lots to break a tie in the vote.\n\nCoat of Arms, Flag and Seal \n\nThe community of Hille obtained the right to a coat of arms, a flag and a seal in 1981 from the Detmold Regional President. (Hauptsatzung § 2)\n\nDescription of the Coat of Arms: In Silver (White) out of a red wavy shield foot grow three red cat-tails with black cylinder above red diagonally oriented windmill blades.\n\nThe windmill blades derive from the coat of arms of the former Amt Hartum, which had many windmills in its territory. The cat-tails derive from the coat of arms of the former community of Hille, where the Hille Moor is located; and where the harvesting of peat was formerly of great significance. The use of red and silver harks back to the historic relationship to the Bishopric of Minden.\n\nDescription of the Flag:\nRed and white horizontally striped with the coat of arms extending from the middle to the flag pole.\n\nDescription of the Banner\nRed and white horizontally striped with the coat of arms extending from the middle to the top.\n\nDescription of the Seal:\nScript on top: GEMEINDE HILLE. Script underneath: KREIS MINDEN-LÜBBECKE. Seal Picture: Coat of Arms in which the content of the coat of arms is given in contours.\n\nCulture and sights\n\nWindmills\nHille is a significant contributor to the Westfalian Mill Road in the so-called Mill(Muehlen) Kreis Minden-Lübbecke.  Five examples of the Dutch type windmill are standing in the community.  The windmill in Hartum has been gutted and converted to a vacation home.  The windmills in Hille and Nordhemmern are functional, they are used to accommodate meetings of associations and groups.  The windmill in Eickhorst is known as the Stork Mill and is operated by a group that conducts an open house every 3rd or 4th Saturday during the season.  Eickhorst also has a water mill with a functioning water wheel.  The related building was converted to a home.  The windmill in Südhemmern has been built as a complete mill complex with the millers house and a community center.  The mill cannot be operated presently since a miller is lacking.  The Mindener Boat Excursion Line (Schifffahrtgesellschaft) offers a combination ticket to the Südhemmern windmill by boat on the Mittlelandkanal from Minden, with a return by the Museum Train (Museumseisenbahn)operating on the Mindener Kreisbahnen track.\n\nTheater\nThere is no dedicated theater building in this rural community, but performances are presented intermittently in the assembly hall of the Combined School (Verbundschule) in the village of Hille.  Two adjacent communities have created open air amphitheaters for amateur productions called Freilichtbühne Nettelstedt and Freilichtbühne Porta.\n\nMuseums\nThe \"Heimathaus Hartum\" demonstrates life and work of the \"good old times\" in a timbered farm-house that dates from 1872.  The old jail for Amt Hartum also still stands in the village of Hartum.  It is noteworthy that this building always had a double function, the other part housed the equipment of the fire brigade.  There is a manual craft museum in Holzhausen II that is located next to the historic smithy.  The Moorgalerie in Eickhorst contains a photography exhibit featuring scenes of the Great Peat Bog.  The old distillery building in the village of Hille is no longer functional but provides an exhibit of the distillation process of \"Hiller Moorbrand\" a schnaps based liquor.  It also contains an exhibit of agricultural work of 150 years ago, with many examples of agricultural utensils on the second floor.\n\nSignificant buildings\nBesides its windmill every village had a village chapel or church at its core.  The local style was determined by timber construction with fieldstone walls and tile roofs.  The village of Hille contains the old distillery Meyer, a former distillery of rye mash.  A stork nest was erected on its chimney.  The family seat of the von Oenhausen family is a substantial part timbered house in the village of Hille that is familiarly referred to as \"Reimlers Hof\".\n\nThe village church in Hille dates from 1523, and was Catholic for a brief time before it became Evangelic-Lutheran in the Reformation.  The building was renovated and expanded over time.  The altar was endowed by the couple Oeynhausen/Pohlmann.  It is located in the west and not the typical east part of the church.  Renovation in 1954/1995 disclosed old ceiling paintings from 1523.  Surrounding the church are tombstones from the old cemetery.  A tombstone from the 16th century was located on the outer wall, shows Conrad von Aswede who was Canon in Minden.  Equally noteworthy is the 600-year-old linden or lime tree that stands next to the church.\n\nParks und Nature Preserves\nThe Community of Hille possesses significant protected natural areas (Naturschutzgebiete) including \"Naturschutzgebiet Großes Torfmoor\", the \"Naturschutzgebiet Bastauwiesen\" and the Mindener Forest (Wald).\n\nThe old farmers spa Rothenuffeln with its sulphur springs has established itself on the north slope of the Wiehengebirge. It includes an old spa park that invites guests for hiking.\n\nSport\nHille and the surrounding area is a significant focus for German handball.  This sport utilizes a ball smaller than a basketball, while scoring is against a goal that is smaller than that for soccer.  The neighboring clubs TuS Nettelstedt-Lübbecke and Grün-Weiß Dankersen Minden play in the German major league, the Handball-Bundesliga.  The renowned handball-players Dieter Waltke und Frank von Behren come from Hille and participated on the German national team.  Every local sport club includes a handball component.\n\nScheduled events\nThe open Market in Hille has been held annually in April and September since 1564. The youth wind or brass orchestra performs during alternating years in the large spa park in Rothenuffeln to initiate its great light show.\n\nCulinary specialties\nMuch grain is grown in this area.  A significant portion of this is converted to Korn (whiskey) or Moorbrand produced in Hille.\n\nEconomy and infrastructure\n\nTransportation\nThe infrastructure of Hille is greatly influenced by the east–west-oriented ridge of the Wiehengebirge as well as the Mittellandkanal, which runs in the same direction.\n\nThe B 65 Road from Hannover to Osnabrück runs through the southern part of the community.  This national connector road was of more significance in the past; a part of its former mission has been superseded by the A 30 Autobahn located on the south side of the Wiehengebirge.\n\nThe closest railway stations are in Minden and Bad Oeynhausen on the main lines Bielefeld–Hannover and Osnabrück–Hannover as well as the railway station in Lübbecke on the Ravensberg Line.  The individual villages are connected by regional and on-call buses with Minden, Lübbecke, Espelkamp and Bad Oeynhausen.  Hille belongs to the transportation cooperative of OstWestfalenLippe.  Freight trains and Museum trains traverse the lines of the Mindener Kreisbahnen.  These tracks run from Hille to Minden's upper city (Oberstad).\n\nRegular bus connections run to Lübbecke, Minden, Espelkamp und Rahden.\n\nThe important Mittellandkanal traverses the community since 1915.  The Harbour of Hille is located on it and is connected to the Mindener Kreisbahn.  Its cargo totals increased from 2005 to 2006.\n\nLong distance bicycle trails like the Bremen–Bad Oeynhausen route, Mühlenroute und Wellness-Radroute traverse the community.\n\nLocal businesses\nAgriculture has a strong influence on the area encompassing the community of Hille.  Besides well functioning farms on loess soil there are many areas with poor soil and meager incomes.  Many residents therefore depended on other work.  This caused the linen industry to grow in the 18th century and the cigar industry in the 19th century.  Work in the home was characteristic of both of them.  The forests provided raw material for furniture manufacture, which however did not become as specialized locally as did the kitchen furnishing industry in the Ravensberg countryside.\n\nAn example of this is Friedrich Priess GmbH & Co KG, a furniture manufactures in Hille since 1931.  the firm Prieß, Horstmann & Co. Maschinenbau, GmbH & Co.KG in Unterlübbe manufactures machine tools for the furniture industry.\n\nThe poor economic conditions in the post World War era caused many job searchers to travel to the Volkswagen works in Hannover.  In those days workers employed at Volkswagen could purchase a car annually and resell it.  This resulted in an active used-car trade for the area.\n\nThe trash landfill Pohlsche Heide is located in Hille, which handles provides trash disposal beyond the Kreis Minden-Lübbecke.\n\nThe R. Bücker EDV-Beratung Datentechnik GmbH is a medium-sized data supply IT Company from Hille. The UPHOFF Schlosserei GmbH is involved in steel construction and machine manufacture with 20 workers in Hille. The dtH Tiemann GmbH builds windows in Hille.  ESKATE Rohrverbindungstechnik GmbH is located in Unterlübbe and specializes in flange and swage connections, as well as special bent products. Rhenus GmbH is a freight transport firm located at the harbour in Hille.\n\nThe Wiehengebirgsmolkerei is a dairy located in Unterlübbe.\n\nMedia\nThe printed media for Hille originates primarily from the city of Minden. This is the locale of the daily newspaper Mindener Tageblatt, which has a page dedicated to Hille.  The radio station Westdeutscher Rundfunk is regarded as the state(Land) radio station.  The WDR TV and radio studio in Bielefeld produces programs focused on East Westfalia (Ostwestfalen).  Commercial competition is provided by Radio Westfalica from Minden, whose local viewpoint is being strengthened.\n\nPublic organizations\nThe voluntary fire fighting brigade for Hille consists of 9 independent pump groups, which are located in the 9 villages of the community.\n\nHospital services are provided at the Kreis level.  The closed hospitals are located in Minden, Lübbecke und Rahden.  The newly constructed Johannes-Wesling-Klinikum opened in 2008.\n\nThe German Red Cross has the Deutsche Rote Kreuz Ortsverein Hille e.V. to provide non-police emergency services.\n\nEducation\nFor a long time, each of the villages had its own schools in which multiple age groups were taught together.  Classes by yearly grade were introduced after the end of WWII and the accompanying population growth.  The subsequent ongoing decline in the birth rate no longer allowed the continuation of the system and led to consolidation.  Subsequently, each village no longer had its own schools, and school children were forced to use a school-bus.  \nHille, Nordhemmern, Oberlübbe and Rothenuffeln are the only villages to retain grade schools.\n\nThe establishment of the Community Hille created the desire to provide more advance schools; it was the previous norm that advanced scholars commuted to higher schools in Minden or Lübbecke.  In the 1950 a combined school with high school like upper grades was created from the existing Hille school.  In 2002 a high school division was permitted and the \"Gesamt (overall) Schule Hille\" was renamed \"Verbundsschule Hille\".\n\nThere is also school in community Hille for children that could benefit from reformed upbringing as well a school for the speech impaired; both serve all of Kreis Minden-Lübbecke.\n\nAn extension of the Volkshochschule (public high school) Minden is located in the Hille community administration building in Hartum.  Another public high school is located in the adjacent city of Espelkamp.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Official site \n\nMinden-Lübbecke"}

{"id": "4107956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newnham%2C%20Kent", "title": "Newnham, Kent", "text": "Newnham is a village and civil parish in the Syndale valley in Kent, England, in the administrative borough of Swale near the medieval market town of Faversham.\n\nHistory \nNewnham has existed as a community of dwellings and work-units for at least 1,000 years. Though it had a lord of the manor and the church of SS Peter and Paul at the beginning of the 12th century, it could be said that nothing of importance ever happened there; yet in it took place centuries of everyday social history and a history of domestic and economic life of generations of English people.\n\nOriginally little more than a grouping of farmhouses and farmworkers' cottages clustered around a church and pub, both more than 600 years old, the village featured blacksmiths, a draper, a butcher, a baker and several other shops and pubs by the early 20th century.\n\nEven until the Second World War, most of its inhabitants were born, worked, lived and died in the valley. Many of the men worked on the hop farms, the apple and cherry orchards, or the wood industries that dominated the local economy. The women were domestic servants in some of the larger houses, many set in parklands on surrounding hills (Sharsted Court, Doddington House, Belmont, Champion Court).\n\nA modern village life \nThough Newnham has changed enormously over the past 250 years, it retains the feel of an archetypal southern English village, though few farmworkers still live there. Fast railway connections to London and the continent of Europe add to the appeal with jobs in Ashford, Canterbury, Maidstone and Medway within easy reach after the completion of the M20, M2, M26 and M25 between the mid-1960s and early 1990s.\n\nThe police house was sold as a private residence in the 1990s, and the post office shut in 1998 while the last shop closed in 2002. Two pub-restaurants remain: opposite the church is the George Inn, which is now no longer mainly a drinking house for locals but instead attracts families and groups of businesspeople for meals. It features 16th-century rafters, inglenook fireplaces, and beer brewed locally (Shepherd Neame at Faversham), and a garden that looks up to the Hilly Field.\n\nAbove the field stands the 12th-century manor house, Champion Court, still an apple farm, though employing few people now and an abundance of modern science, overlooking the valley. The other pub-restaurant is much newer but has the air of a barn converted from use on the Syndale vineyard. From its garden there is another striking view across the village past the oast house, now converted from drying hops for beer into a private home. At the location of Syndale Vineyard is also the local brewery, Hopdaemon.\n\nThe church's glebe lands, near the centre of the village, provided the space for a post-war housing development. Most of the other houses in the village front onto The Street and include Tudor dwellings, Victorian terraced cottages, and many houses now joined to make larger homes. There is also a collection of infilled recently built houses squeezed into former orchards and fields that abutted The Street and which provided the only late 20th-century development land (which has to be within the \"village envelope\" according to planning restrictions).\n\nArchitecture and Economy \nMuch of the village is a conservation area and several buildings are individually listed while the village is within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (Kent Downs AONB). Building in the open countryside is tightly restricted, in favour of agriculture, horse-riding and walking.  The average commuting distance is .\n\nA notable listed house is Calico House, built in the early 17th century. Another sizeable house was the 19th-century vicarage, no longer used as such. It was built in 1860 by the incumbent vicar who also rebuilt the crumbling church, largely at his own expense. The tiny Congregationalist chapel, a widespread church of nonconformism also stands, currently being converted to a small private house.\n\nThe valley road was a highway in Norman times, linking the Roman Watling Street (Dover and Canterbury to London, the A2) to the Pilgrims' Way on the other side of the downs. However it was almost impassable in winter and Newnham was substantially self-sufficient until the 19th century. Indeed, the shops that residents whose closure the older villagers bemoan probably did not begin till the 1840 when passing tradesmen and deliveries made it possible to open a draper's and grocery shop. A 2010 excavation established that a full-scale Roman road passed along the valley though its precise route remains to be confirmed; it has been explored only near the Watling Street (A2) Syndale junction and at the foot of Newnham's \"hilly field\".\n\nMany farmhouses in the village, including the old Parsonage Farm whose farmhouse now stands in only half an acre next to the church in The Street, have yielded most of their farmlands to provide space to accommodate new homes.\n\nChurch, school and amenities \nThe church of SS Peter and Paul dates back to medieval times and now shares a vicar with half a dozen other parishes. The village no longer has a school of its own (indeed it lost it as early as 1877 when the board school opened in Doddington, the only other village in the valley. Doddington lost its primary school too in 2008).\n\nNearby Doddington still has a butcher's shop and that successor of the village blacksmith, a garage and petrol station, as well as its pub and church. It also has a hostel for walkers to complement the bed and breakfast accommodation it offers to visitors to the area.\n\nBoth villages, about  apart, have a village hall, now used for keep-fit classes and the occasional auction or flower show. They share a war memorial to those killed in two world wars. Neither village in the valley has street lights or mains drainage as there is little demand for such. Broadband internet access, mobile phone connection and satellite television signals are becoming more prevalent especially with demand from home-workers and children whereas mains water and gas supplies are well-established.\n\nThe valley is chalky downland and is atop a plentiful aquifer which provides water to the nearby urban communities. The pumping station in the valley stands beside a unique 1937 experimental building, recently bought and undergoing conversion to residential use. The building was designed to soften the hard lime-scaling water which it pumps from the ground. The eponymous water softening plant in fact in Norton, Buckland and Stone was built for the Kent Water Board and is one of few remaining if not the last of its kind. The Twentieth Century Society proposed the concrete structures for listing citing their \"tremendous sculptural qualities\" and Grade II listing was granted in November 2006. As such, it joined a range of older and more traditional buildings, including several thatched houses.\n\nThe population of Newnham numbered 24 householders in 1569. In the first national census in 1801, there were 262 residents reaching what may have been a peak of 451 in 88 houses in 1841 just before out-migration began in earnest. In 1931, there were 258 people in 92 homes and there are now about 350 people in 145 houses.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nNewnham & Doddington villages: shared site\nKent Downs AONB\nSwale borough tourism site\nWater softening plant at Twentieth Century Society site.

{"id": "4107982", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%20Were%20the%20Shudras%3F", "title": "Who Were the Shudras?", "text": "Who Were the Shudras? is a history book published by Indian social reformer and polymath B. R. Ambedkar in 1946. The book discusses the origin of the Shudra Varna. Ambedkar dedicated the book to Jyotirao Phule (1827–1890).\n\nSubject of the book\nIn the book, Ambedkar citing Rigveda, Mahabharata and other ancient vedic scriptures, estimates that the Shudras were originally Aryans. \n\nAmbedkar writes in the preface of the book,\n\n\"Two questions are raised in this book: (1) Who were the Shudras? and (2) How they came to be the fourth Varna of the Indo-Aryan society? My answers to them are summarised below.\n\n The Shudras were one of the Aryan communities of the solar race\"\n There was a time when the Aryan society recognised only three Varnas, namely. Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. The Shudras did not form a separate Varna. They ranked as part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society. There was a continuous feud between the Shudra kings and the Brahmins in which the Brahmins were subjected to many tyrannies and indignities. As a result of the negligence towards the Shudras generated by their tyrannies and oppressions, the Brahmins refused to perform the Upanayana of the Shudras. Owing to the denial of Upanayana, the Shudras who were Kshatriyas became socially degraded, fell below the rank of the Vaishyas and thus came to form the fourth Varna.\"\n\nImportantly, Ambedkar states that the Shudras of Hindu society are entirely different from Shudras of ancient Indo-Aryan Society. The common misconception that the two are related in terms of ancestry stems from the fact that people believe that the Hindu and Indo-Aryan meaning of the word \"Shudras\" is the same, when they are actually different. In the Indo-Aryan society, the word referred to a particular race of people, whereas in the Hindu society, the word loosely applies to individuals of a low social status, who are considered \"uncultured\". Ambedkar claims that the application of the word in the Hindu sense is incorrect as it wrongly associates them with the people and culture of the Indo-Aryan society, who committed wrongdoings, such as offending the Brahmins.\n\nAmbedkar also discusses Aryan race theory and rejects Indo-Aryan invasion theory  in the book.\n\nAccording to Arvind Sharma, Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge anās in Rig Veda 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the nose. Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating that there are two main understandings of the word Anasa.'' The first, by Professor Max Muller, is read as a-nasa, and refers to having a flat nose, or no nose at all. Whereas, the second, by Sayanacharya, is read as an-asa, and refers to the lack of mouth, or the lack of good speech. Although Ambedkar acknowledges that Professor Muller's version supports the belief that Dasyus and Aryans were of different races, he claims that there is a lack of evidence for this view, and expresses support for Sayanacharya's view.\n\nContents \nPreface\n\nPart I \n Chapter I - The Riddle of the Shudras\n Chapter II - The Brahmanic Theory of the Origin of the Shudras\n Chapter III - The Brahmanic Theory of the Status of the Shudras\n Chapter IV - Shudras Versus Aryans\n Chapter V - Aryans Against Aryans\n Chapter VI - Shudra And Dasas\n\nPart II \n Chapter VII - The Shudras were Kshatriyas\n Chapter VIII - The Number of Varnas, Three or Four?\n Chapter IX - Brahmins Versus Shudras\n Chapter X - The Degradation of the Shudras\n Chapter XI - The Story of Reconciliation\n Chapter XII - The Theory in the Crucible\n\nCriticism \nHistorian R.

{"id": "4107996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iele", "title": "Iele", "text": "The iele are feminine mythical creatures in Romanian mythology. There are several differing descriptions of their characteristics. Often they are described as faeries (zâne in Romanian), with great seductive power over men, with magic skills and attributes similar to nymphs, naiads and dryads found in Greek mythology.\n\nLocations\nThe iele are said to live in the sky, in forests, in caves and on isolated mountain cliffs, and reported to have been seen bathing in the springs or at crossroads. From this point of view, the Iele are similar to the Ancient Greek Hecate, a three headed goddess of Thracian origin, who guards crossroads.\n\nActivities\nThey mostly appear at night by moonlight, as dancing Horas, in secluded areas such as glades, the tops of certain trees (maples, walnut trees), ponds, river sides, crossroads or abandoned fireplaces, dancing naked, with their breasts almost covered by their disheveled hair, with bells on their ankles and carrying candles. In almost all of these instances, the Iele appear to be incorporeal. Rarely, they are dressed in chain mail coats. The effect of their specific dance, the Hora is similar to the dances of the Bacchantes.\n\nScorching\nThe place where they had danced would after remain carbonized, with the grass incapable of growing on the trodden ground, and with the leaves of the surrounding trees scorched. Later, when grass would finally grow, it would have a red or dark-green color, the animals would not eat it, but instead mushrooms would thrive on it.\n\nNames\nDimitrie Cantemir describes the iele as \"Nymphs of the air, in love especially with young men\". The origin of these beliefs is unknown. Incidentally, the noun iele is phonetically close to the feminine plural form of the Romanian word for \"they\". Their real names are secret and inaccessible, and are commonly replaced with nicknames based on their characteristics. The names based on epithets are: Iele, Dânse, Drăgaice, Vâlve, Iezme, Izme, Irodiţe, Rusalii, Nagode, Vântoase, Domniţe, Măiestre, Frumoase, Muşate, Fetele Codrului, Împărătesele Văzduhului, Zânioare, Sfinte de noapte, Şoimane, Mândre, Fecioare, Albe, Hale, etc. But there are also personal names which appear: Ana, Bugiana, Dumernica, Foiofia, Lacargia, Magdalina, Ruxanda, Tiranda, Trandafira, Rudeana, Ruja, Păscuţa, Cosânzeana, Orgisceana, Lemnica, Roşia, Todosia, Sandalina, Margalina, Savatina, Rujalina, etc. These names must not be used randomly, as they may be the basis for dangerous enchantments. It is believed that every witch knows nine of these pseudonyms, from which she makes combinations, and which are the basis for spells.\n\nCharacter\nThe iele are said not to be  solitary creatures, but gather in groups in the air, where they can fly with or without wings; they can travel with incredible speeds, either on their own, or with chariots of fire. \nThe iele appear sometimes with bodies, at other times only as immaterial spirits. They are young and beautiful, voluptuous immortals, their frenzy causing delirium in onlookers, and with bad tempers, but not being necessarily evil. They come in groups of three or seven. This version is mostly found in Oltenia, were three Iele are considered the daughters of Alexander the Great, called Catrina, Zalina and Marina.\n\nSometimes evil\nThey are not generally considered evil genii: they resort to revenge only when they are provoked, offended, seen while they dance, when people step on the trodden ground left behind by their dance, sleep under a tree which the Iele consider as their property, drink from the springs or wells used by them. Terrible punishments are inflicted upon the ones who refuse their invitation to dance, or the ones who mimic their movements. The one who randomly hears their songs becomes instantly mute. A main characteristic is their beautiful voices which are used to enchant their listeners, just like the Sirens from ancient Greek mythology. Invisible to humans, there are however certain moments when they can be seen by mortals, such as when they dance at night. When this happens, they abduct the victim, punishing the \"guilty\" one with magical spells, after they previously caused him to fall into sleep with the sounds and the vertigo of the frenetic Hora, which they dance around their victim, who is abducted, to disappear forever without a trace.\n\nVengeance\nThe iele are also believed to be agents of revenge for God or of the Devil, having the right to avenge in the name of their employers. When they are called upon to act, they hound their victims into the center of their dance, until they die in a furor of madness or torment. In this hypostasis, the Iele are similar to the Ancient Greek Erinyes and the Roman Furies.\n\nAppeasing the Iele\nTo please the iele, people dedicated festival days to them: the Rusaliile, the Stratul, the Sfredelul or Bulciul Rusaliilor, the nine days after the Easter, the Marina etc. Anyone not respecting these holidays was said to suffer the revenge of the Iele: men and women who work during these days would be lifted in spinning vertigo, people and cattle would suffer mysterious deaths or become paralyzed and crippled, hail would fall, rivers would flood, trees would wither, and houses would catch fire.\n\nPeople also invented cures against the iele, either preventive or exorcistic in nature: garlic and mugwort worn around the waist, in the bosom, or hung from the hat; or hanging the skull of a horse on a pole in front of the house. The most important cure is the dance of Călușari. This custom was the subject of an episode of the popular TV series, The X-Files (see The Calusari).\n\nComparison with other mythologies\nThe same common Indo-European mythological base is suggested by the close resemblance with the Nordic Elves, youthful feminine humanoid spirits of great beauty living in forests and other natural places, underground, or in wells and springs; having as a sacred tree the same maple tree; and with magical powers, such as having the ability to cast spells with their circle dances. The elves also leave a kind of circle where they had danced, the älvdanser (\"elf dances\") or älvringar (\"elf circles\"). Typically, this circle also consisted of a ring of small mushrooms.

{"id": "4107999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Polish%20alliance", "title": "Anglo-Polish alliance", "text": "The military alliance between the United Kingdom and Poland was formalised by the Anglo-Polish Agreement in 1939, with subsequent addenda of 1940 and 1944, for mutual assistance in case of a military invasion from Nazi Germany, as specified in a secret protocol.\n\nBackground\nThe United Kingdom had been attempting to create a four-way alliance to contain Germany, with France, Poland and the Soviet Union. Poland's Jozef Beck was disturbed by the prospect of any alliance with the Soviets. He also feared the reaction of Berlin to the four-way alliance, which might be seen as the encirclement of Germany. Beck, however, saw an opportunity and so he proposed a secret agreement on consultation to British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax that was received on 24th March, 1939. When questioned by Halifax, Polish Foreign Minister Edward Bernard Raczyński said that he thought that Beck had British aid in mind in the event of an attack on Poland, but it would not be a mutual agreement.\n\nBritish assurance to Poland\nOn 31 March 1939, in response to Nazi Germany's defiance of the Munich Agreement and its occupation of Czechoslovakia, in Parliament, the United Kingdom pledged the support of itself and France to assure Polish independence:\n\nThe British Chiefs of Staff at the time however noted that \"we could give no direct help by land, sea or air.\"\n\nOn 6 April, during a visit to London by the Polish foreign minister, it was agreed to formalise the assurance as an Anglo–Polish military alliance, pending negotiations. The text of the \"Anglo-Polish Communiqué\" stated that the two governments were \"in complete agreement on certain general principles\" and that it was \"agreed that the two countries were prepared to enter into an agreement of permanent and reciprocal character...\". The British Blue Book for 1939 indicates that formal agreement was not signed until 25 August.\n\nThat assurance was extended on 13 April to Greece and Romania, after Italy's invasion of Albania.\n\nAgreement of Mutual Assistance\n\nOn 25 August, two days after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union with a secret protocol that partitioned Central and Eastern Europe between them. The agreement contained promises of mutual military assistance between the nations if either was attacked by some \"European country\". The United Kingdom, sensing a trend of German expansionism, sought to discourage German aggression by this show of solidarity. In a secret protocol of the pact, the United Kingdom offered assistance in the case of an attack on Poland specifically by Germany, but in the case of attack by other countries, the parties were required only to \"consult together on measures to be taken in common\". Both the United Kingdom and Poland were bound not to enter agreements with any other third countries that were a threat to the other. Because of the pact's signing, Hitler postponed his planned invasion of Poland from 26 August until 1 September.\n\nFailed Soviet–Franco–British alliance\n\nAfter the German occupation of Prague in March 1939 in violation of the Munich agreement, the Chamberlain government in Britain sought Soviet and French support for a Peace Front. The goal was to deter further German aggression by guaranteeing the independence of Poland and Romania. However, Stalin refused to pledge Soviet support for the guarantees unless Britain and France first concluded a military alliance with the Soviet Union. Although the British cabinet decided to seek such an alliance, the western negotiators in Moscow in August 1939 lacked urgency. The talks were conducted poorly and slowly by diplomats with little authority, such as William Strang, an assistant under-secretary. Stalin also insisted on British and French guarantees to Finland, the Baltic states, Poland and Romania against indirect German aggression. Those countries, however, became fearful that Moscow wanted to control them.  Although Hitler was escalating threats against it, Poland refused to allow Soviet troops to cross its borders for fear that they would never leave. Historian Michael Jabara Carley argues that the British were too committed to anticommunism to trust Stalin.\n\nMeanwhile, both Great Britain and USSR were separately involved into secret negotiations with Germany. Eventually Stalin was attracted to a much better deal by Hitler, the control of most of Eastern Europe, and decided to sign the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.\n\nPolish–British Naval Agreement \nEver since it had been sent to Britain in mid-1939 in Operation Peking, the Polish Navy remained in British waters. In November 1939, after the Invasion of Poland, the Polish-British Naval Agreement allowed Polish sailors to wear their Polish uniforms and to have Polish commanding officers on board even though the ships were of British make. The agreement would later be revised on August 5, 1940 to encompass all Polish units.\n\nAnglo–Polish Agreement Respecting Polish Land and Air Forces\nOn August 5, 1940, an agreement was signed that \"the Polish Armed Forces (comprising Land, Sea, and Air Forces) shall be organized and employed under British Command\" but would be \"subject to Polish military law and disciplinary ruling, and they [would] be tried in Polish military courts\". The only change came on 11 October 1940, when the Polish Air Force was made an exception and became subject to British discipline and laws.\n\nAnalysis\nThe alliance committed Britain, for the first time in history, to fight on behalf of a European country other than France or Belgium. Hitler was then demanding the cession of the Free City of Danzig, an extraterritorial highway (the Reichsautobahn Berlin-Königsberg) across the Polish Corridor and special privileges for the ethnic German minority within Poland. By the terms of the military alliance, both Poland and Britain were free to decide whether to oppose with force any territorial encroachment, as the pact did not include any statement of either party's commitment to the defence of the other party's territorial integrity. However, there were provisions regarding \"indirect threats\" and attempts to undermine either party's independence by means of \"economic penetration\" in a clear reference to the German demands.\n\nIn May 1939, Poland signed a secret protocol to the 1921 Franco-Polish Military Alliance, but it was not ratified by France until 4 September.\n\nOn 17 September, the Soviet Union invaded Poland through the eastern Polish border in keeping with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact's secret protocol specifying the division of Poland. According to the Polish–British Common Defence Pact, the United Kingdom should give Poland \"all the support and assistance in its power\" if Poland was \"engaged in hostilities with a European Power in consequence of aggression by the latter\". The Polish ambassador in London, Edward Bernard Raczyński, contacted the British Foreign Office to point out that clause 1(b) of the agreement, which concerned an \"aggression by a European power\" on Poland, should apply to the Soviet invasion. Halifax responded that the obligation of British government towards Poland that arose out of the Anglo-Polish Agreement was restricted to Germany, according to the first clause of the secret protocol.\n\nCriticism\n\nThe Polish historian Paweł Wieczorkiewicz wrote, \"Polish leaders were not aware of the fact that England and France were not ready for war. They needed time to catch up with the Third Reich, and were determined to gain the time at any price\". The publicist Stanisław Mackiewicz stated in the late 1940s, \"To accept London's guarantees was one of the most tragic dates in the history of Poland. It was a mental aberration and madness\". On the same day that Britain pledged its support of Poland, Lord Halifax stated, \"We do not think this guarantee will be binding\". Another British diplomat, Alexander Cadogan, wrote in his diary: \"Naturally, our guarantee does not give any help to Poland. It can be said that it was cruel to Poland, even cynical\".\n\nPolish-British military negotiations were carried out in London but ended up in a fiasco. After lengthy talks, the British reluctantly pledged to bomb German military and installations if the Germans carried out attacks of that kind in Poland. Polish military leaders failed to obtain any other promises. At the same time, the Polish side negotiated a military loan. The Polish ambassador to Britain, Edward Raczyński, called the negotiations \"a never-ending nightmare\". Józef Beck wrote in his memoirs, \"The negotiations, carried out in London by Colonel Adam Koc, immediately turned into theoretical discussion about our financial system. It was clear that Sir John Simon and Frederick Leith-Ross did not realize the gravity of the situation. They negotiated in purely financial terms, without consideration for the rules of the wartime alliance. As a result, the English offer gave us no grounds for quick reinforcement of our army\".\n\nOn 2 August 1939, Britain finally agreed to grant Poland a military loan of £9 million, which was less than Turkey received at the same time. Poland had asked for a loan of £60 million.\n\nSee also\n International relations (1919–1939)\n Franco-Polish Military Alliance\n Western betrayal\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n Piotr Zychowicz, Pakt Ribbentrop - Beck.

{"id": "4108019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardclough", "title": "Ardclough", "text": "Ardclough, officially Ardclogh (; ), is a village and community in the parish of Kill, County Kildare, Ireland. It is two miles (3 km) off the N7 national primary road.  It is the burial place and probable birthplace of Arthur Guinness, who is said to have returned to the maternal homestead of the Reads at Huttonread to give birth in the tradition of the time.\n\nLocation\nArdclough is located below two detached foothills of the Wicklow Mountains, Lyons Hill and Oughterard on some of the most fertile soils in Ireland. The River Liffey passes within a one kilometre radius. The main transport arteries to the south and south west of Ireland pass through, the main railway line to Cork and Tralee, the canal to Shannonbridge, and the N7 which passes nearby.\n\nWhile the original townland of Ardclough was situated west of the canal in land that is now inaccessible, and contained the site on the opposite bank of the canal of the original (1810) parish church of Lyons and a group of quarries there, the place now referred to Ardclough approximates more closely to the townlands of Tipperstown and Wheatfield, where housing was built in 1876 and 1989. The development of 54 houses on a nearby site was proposed, but has yet to begin.  Construction on a new 16-classroom national school began near the original site of Tipperstown House in January 2011. A new graveyard is also planned on a site south east of the current centre of the village.\n\nGeology\nThe soil is principally a rich loam, varying from 10 to  in depth, and resting on a hard and compact substratum of floetz limestone. The water table is unusually high. The low group of nearby hills, which includes Lyons and Oughterard in County Kildare and Windmill Hill, Athgoe, and Rusty Hill in County Dublin, are composed of clay-slate, grauwacke, grauwaeke-slate, and granite. The grauwacke consists of small and finely rounded and angular grains of quartz, numerous minute scales of mica, small fragments of clay-slate, and sometimes portions of felspar. The grauwacke consists of small and finely rounded and angular grains of quartz, numerous minute scales of mica, small fragments of clay-slate, and sometimes portions of felspar and red sandstone.\n\nEtymology\nThe name was first recorded as 'Aclagh' on Alexander Taylor's 1783 map. It was the site of the masshouse (later old Ardclough church), school and the three largest of seven local quarries, on the opposite bank of the canal. From 1837 onward it was recorded as 'Ardclogh' and later 'Ardclough'. The name likely comes from Ard Cloch, meaning \"high stone or stone building\".\n\nHabitat\nThe area provides a combination of hill, wood and water habitats. More than 35 species of birds have been identified and coarse fishing for pike, perch, roach and rudd is common along the canal bank.\n\nAmenities\nAmongst the settlement's buildings today are a national school, a church, Ardclough GAA Club, and one shop \"Buggys\". Ardclough also contains the historic round tower at Oughterard.\n\nHistory\n\nRoyal site\nThe earliest evidence of human habitation at Ardclough was the discovery of a flint dated to 4800–3600BC, at Castlewarden below Oughter Ard Hill, rare for a dry-land location from the time.  Lyons Hill was the inauguration site and base for 10 Uí Dúnchada kings of Leinster. The Battle of Glen Mama, where Brian Boru defeated Máel Mórda king of Leinster and Sitric Silkbeard King of Dublin in 999, is believed to have taken place on the Dublin side of Oughterard Hill. The area was accorded its own place-legend in the Dindsenchas, Liamuin. Lyons subsequently became home to the Aylmer, Tyrrell and Lawless families.\n\nHistoric buildings\nThere are five medieval churches and three castles in the area. Most important is Oughter Ard, a seventh-century monastery associated with saints Briga (feast day 21 January) and Derchairthinn (feast day 8 March) and site of a round tower. Recent research has estimated that the ruined church there dates to 1350, not 1609 as previously believed. It was the site of a Royal Manor. Whitechurch, (Ecclesia Alba, named for the Carmelite order) was granted in 1320, and enfifed in 1508. A single headstone is the only reminder of the church of Castledillon, (1000), once a parish of its own. The graveyard beside another disappeared church at Clonaghlis, (pre 1206) is still in use and is associated with female saints Fedhlim and Mughain. Castlewarden (c1200) church has disappeared. Reeves Castle, on the Celbridge road, was built in the 14th century.\n\nA mass house built below Oughter Ard hill in 1714 became the site of the first modern Catholic church in 1810 and a school in 1839. Lyons parish was united with Oughterard in 1541 and with Kill in 1693. The centre of the parish moved to Kill in 1823. The former Lyons parish church (built 1810, refurbished 1896) was deconsecrated in 1985 and is now a private house. It was replaced by a new church in Tipperstown, designed by Paul O'Daly. A marble font, brought from Rome by Valentine Lawless and presented to the church, was removed to Lyons House for safekeeping but remains the property of the parish.\n\nA well-preserved moated site at Puddlehall dates to the 13th century and was cited by University College Dublin Professor Sean O Riordain as one of the finest examples of a moated house in Ireland. Lyons, Reeves and Oughter Ard tower houses date to the 14th century. The large houses of Bishopscourt (constructed 1790) and Lyons (constructed 1804-10) provided an economic focus of the community in the 19th century, as did the Grand Canal (reached Ardclough 1763) in the vicinity of the 13th lock.\n\nGrand canal\nWhen work on the Grand Canal began in 1756 Ardclough's was one of the first sections to be dug. The canal reached Ardclough in 1763, when the 13th lock, a  double lock built with Pozzuolona mortar, was opened, following the ambitious design of the canal's original engineer, Thomas Omer. After Omer's plans proved too expensive a new engineer, John Trail, took over construction of the canal in 1768, the proposed canal capacity was reduced from 170 ton barges to 40 ton barges. Canal records show that \" Lyons or Clonaughles lock\" was reduced in size in 1783, but the canal through the thirteenth lock serves as a reminder of Omer's original plan,  wide, compared with the  width adopted by Trail.\n\nArdclough Bridge was named in original plans for the Bruton family of Clonaghlis but constructed with a name plate bearing the name of the Henry family of Straffan. From 1777 a local river, the Morrel was proposed as water feeder for the canal, construction resumed and the first passenger boats were towed to Sallins in February 1779.\n\nLocal landowner The 2nd Baron Cloncurry was a canal enthusiast, constructing the Lyons mill and lockyard village complex in the 1820s and serving as chairman of the Grand Canal Company five times during his lifetime. The canal was an important, if slow, passenger thoroughfare feeding passenger's to John Barry's hotel at Lyons. When in 1834 Flyboats increased the average speed for passenger boats from  to  Ireland's first railway was already under construction.\n\nThe canal peaked at 120,615 passengers in 1846, the year construction started on the Dublin-Cork railway line. When a Dublin-Galway railway line was opened in 1850 the closure of the rarely profitable passenger service followed in 1852. Cargo traffic continued to use the canal for another 108 years, peaking at 379.045 tons in 1865 when an average of 90 barges a day passed through Ardclough. The canal was motorised 1911–24 and closed to cargo in 1960, but is still a thoroughfare for leisure boats. The tracks of the ropes of the horse-drawn barges can still be traced at Ardclough canal bridge. A folk belief prevailed that the canal was haunted at the thirteenth lock because it had been dug through a graveyard, a possible reference to nearby Clonaghlis graveyard.\n\nNotable events\n\nThe Great Southern & Western Railway (constructed 1844) and Straffan railway station (used until 1947) opened communications to Dublin for cattle and horse dealers. A railway accident on 5 October 1853, the third-worst in Irish rail history, killed 18 people including four children in the townland of Clownings. It occurred in heavy fog when a goods train ran into the back of a stalled passenger train at a point 974 yards south of the former Straffan Station. The goods train smashed the first-class carriage, which was driven a quarter of a mile through station. The tragedy was the subject of a poem by Donegal-born poet William Allingham. It was the third worst accident in rail history to that date.\n\nIn the Ardclough Sedition Case in October 1917, Nora J Murray, a nationalist poet and writer, the headmistress of Ardclough National School was accused by local Irish Unionist Bertram Hugh Barton of 'sedition in time of war' under the Defence of the Realm Act. He complained about her teaching of Irish history, illegal at the time. in a complaint made in the name of one of Barton's tenants, Kathleen Bourke, an activist in the Women's Unionist Association. After a local defence fund was mounted by the INTO and the local community, the charged was not pursued by the Dublin Castle regime but Murray she was forced out of the area and the house where she lodged was later burned by the British Army.\n\nThe Barnewell homestead at Lyons was the headquarters of anti-treaty forces in north Kildare during the Irish Civil War. \nOn 22 June 1975 Whitechurch resident Christy Phelan was killed when he engaged a group of men planting a bomb on the railway line near Baronrath. The bomb was designed to derail the train headed for the Republican Wolfe Tone commemoration at Bodenstown. His selfless intervention prevented greater loss of life. This is one of a number of British undercover operations carried out against civilian targets in the Republic during the Troubles, currently under investigation by the Barron Commission.\n\nThe biggest train robbery to date in the history of Ireland took place at Kearneystown on 31 March 1976 when £150,000 was taken from the Dublin-Cork mail train.\n\nDaniel O’Connell (1775–1847) fought a duel with John d’Esterre at Oughterard on 1 February 1815.\n\nEconomy\n\nLimestone quarries (sinkhole recorded 1804) made Ardclough townland, which is located on a canal bank, the focus of economic activity from the 1800s until the death of owner Patrick Sullivan in 1879 (peak activity 1850s). This townland was also chosen as the location for Lyons parish church (1811) and St Anne's National School (1834). Boston Lime Company reduced the price to six shillings per load in 1875 but a footnote in the 1891 census returns attributes the decline in population from 75 to 21 in Ardclough townland to the closure of quarries. Stone was brought by light railway to the nearby quays and by canal barge to Sullivan's lime kiln. Ardclough limestone was used in the construction of Naas jail and hospital. The census reports of the mid-19th century indicate how the small townland of Ardclough came to give its name to the adjoining district, but by 1901 there were only six people living there.\n\nA cluster of warehouses and workshops at Lyons lockyard village was largely constructed in the 1820s, featuring a mill (leased to William Palmer 1839 and Joseph Shackleton, second cousin of Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton, 1853, converted to roller mill 1887), hotel (leased by Patrick Barry 1840-60), police station (active 1820-73 ) and boatyard. This complex employed over 100 people at their peak but declined when the focus shifted away from the canal, the decline in fortunes of the Lawless family and most dramatically as a consequence of the accidental burning of the mill in 1903. In September 2006 the buildings were restored as themed residences and a restaurant.\n\nArdclough Relocates\nWhen the GAA club (1936), community hall (1940, reconstructed 2004) and school (1950) were built on a crossroads beneath Henry Bridge, and it shifted the focus of the community to a site in Tipperstown, which is regarded as the modern Ardclough. The population was boosted by houses built at Wheatfield (1940), Boston Hill (1949–51) and Tipperstown (Wheatfield Estate 1976, Lishandra Estate 1989). St. Anne's Church, a Catholic church designed by Paul O’Daly was sited nearby in 1985.\n\nSport\n\nGAA\nArdclough GAA (community associated with Hazlehatch Irish Harpers 1887-8, active as Ardclough 1924-5, refounded 1936) is the smallest community to win a Kildare County Senior Football Championship, defeating an Army team that featured All Ireland and inter-provincial players in the replayed final of 1949. The hurling club was founded in 1948. One of the most successful in Kildare, it has won 13 Kildare County Senior Hurling Championships - in 1968, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, 2004, 2006 and 2017. In 2006 they went on to become Leinster Intermediate club champions, losing to the eventual All Ireland champions in extra time in the quarter-final, and were awarded Kildare GAA club of the year. The 2008 Kildare senior hurling panel included six Ardclough players.\n\nArdclough Camogie club (founded 1962 by Mick Houlihan, revived 1983 by Phyllis Finneran) won a Kildare senior championship in 1968. Bridget Cushen was selected on the Kildare camogie team of the century.\n\nEquestrianism\nNotable Ardclough horses in both flat and national hunt (once described as \"the four horses of the Ardcloughalypse\") include The Tetrarch (1911, regarded as probably the finest two-year-old in Irish racing history), Captain Christy (winner Cheltenham Gold Cup, 1974), Star Appeal (winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, 1975) and Kicking King (winner Cheltenham Gold Cup, 2005). Father-and-son horse trainers Pat Taaffe and Tom Taaffe came from Alasty. As a jockey Pat Taaffe (1930–92) rode two winners of the English Grand National, Quare Times in 1955 and Gay Trip in 1970 and was Irish National Hunt champion six times.\n\nOther sports\nDavid Ritchie who lived at Oughterard laid out Ireland's first golf course. Ardclough had a soccer club briefly in 1941-3. Basil Phipps launched his motorcycle racing career in 1947 and hosted a number of racing events at his home in Clonaghlis. Fionn Carr was top try-scorer for Connacht during the Magners League 2008/09 campaign and later signed for Leinster.\n\nClubs\nArdclough had a brass band which performed at Bodenstown in 1914 and at the 1949 Kildare County Senior Football final. There was a branch of the LDF/FCA (8 November 1941), Fianna Fáil (1931), Labour (1943), Fine Gael (1943) and Macra na Feirme (1955). There are active branches of the Irish Countrywomen's Association (active 1941-42 and revived 1974, with Maura Costello (1924-2011) as Chairwoman) and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (branch established in 1966 with Paddy Corry (1916-1971) as Chairman).\n\nPeople\n\nLived in Ardclough\nGerald Aylmer (c1500-1559), judge and enforcer for English King Henry VIII in Ireland at the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries,\nValentine Lawless, 2nd Baron Cloncurry (1773-1853), a local landlord and member of the United Irishmen who helped finance both the 1798 and 1803 rebellions.\nBaron Cloncurry (1840-1928), local landlord and Unionist and Conservative politician who served as High Sheriff of Kildare in 1867.\nRonan Keating (b.1977), lead singer with Boyzone, lived in Ardclough when he was growing up.\nNora J Murray (1888–1955), Carrick-on-Shannon born poet, author of \"A Wind Upon the Heath\" (1918), school teacher at Ardclough and subject of a notorious \"sedition in the classroom\" case in November 1917 when a local landlord complained about her teaching of Irish history.\nJames Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond (1393–1452), popularly known as 'the White Earl'.

It connects the new towns of Sha Tin and Tai Po in the eastern New Territories, forming part of the New Territories Circular Road.\n\nThe  highway, constructed in three stages between 1985 and 1987, was so named as it skirts the western edge of Tolo Harbour.\n\nRoute description\nThe highway diverges from Tai Po Road near Sha Tin Racecourse. The following  of the road, running alongside the East Rail line, was built on an embankment on the west coast of Tolo Harbour towards Yuen Chau Tsai (Island House), which marks the eastern end of the Tai Po New Town. Construction began in March 1999 to expand the section to a dual four-lane carriageway and was finished in August 2003. The section below the campus of the Chinese University of Hong Kong has since become landlocked owing to the reclamation for the Hong Kong Science Park.\n\nThe next section,  long, bypasses Tai Po on the hills to its south, over Wun Yiu, Ma Wo and Pun Chun Yuen. As the alignment crosses a number of remote ravines far away from existing roads, four bridges along the bypass had to be incrementally launched. This was the first instance of such bridge building technique being adopted in Hong Kong. Originally a dual 3-lane carriageway, this section was upgraded to a dual four-lane carriageway between August 2009 and March 2014.

His burial certificate indicates he was 50 or slightly younger when he died, so he must have been born between 1651 and 1653. It is assumed that he became organist of the Chartres Cathedral on 6 December 1667. The date is questionable, but the fact that Jullien was appointed organist of the cathedral while still very young is indisputable. He occupied this position until his death in Chartres in 1703. He was succeeded at the cathedral by his eldest son, Jean-François Jullien.\n\nAll of Jullien's surviving music is contained in his Premier Livre d'orgue (Paris, 1690). It consists of around 80 pieces (most influenced by Nicolas Lebègue's work), organized into eight organ suites in the eight church modes. According to the preface, these works were intended for liturgical use, but the only link to the liturgy is a fugue on Ave maris stella. The suites also contain several four- and five-voice fugues that reflect Jullien's studies of counterpoint, but, like most French composers of the time, he was not particularly apt at complex polyphony, and both his fugues and his grasp of chromatic writing have been deemed primitive. The préludes and récits de dessus have been considered the most successful pieces.\n\nJullien's Premier Livre d'orgue has a number of interesting features. One of these is that in the preface Jullien claims to have invented five-voice genres, even though such pieces appeared earlier, in collections by Nicolas Gigault and André Raison, published in the late 1680s. Furthermore, the collection concludes, very unusually, with a choral piece, Cantantibus organis. Another vocal work by Jullien, La Crèche de Bethléem, is known by name only, and the second organ book was apparently planned, but never appeared.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n Apel, Willi. 1972.

The objective was to launch the Dodge nameplate and produce a mini-sized vehicle aimed exclusively at young urban consumers in Europe. According to Dieter Zetsche, Chairman of DaimlerChrysler (as the companies were merged at that time), the automaker was looking to use an existing small car platform, which might first have been from Mitsubishi and then Volkswagen's Polo was considered.\nBy 2008, the Hornet was planned to be the first product from the cooperation between Chrysler and Nissan, sharing the platform of the Nissan Versa.\n\nAccording to Dodge, the 2006 concept car was a rally inspired design, powered by a 1.6 L supercharged 4-cylinder Tritec engine rated at . This engine was capable of launching the car from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 7.5 seconds, and had an estimated top speed of . This engine was manufactured in a Chrysler-BMW joint venture in Brazil.\n\nThe original plans for Dodge's first attempt at building a car this small was a 2010 market introduction, but the 2009 financial crisis and combined with the Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization put a stop to further development.\n\nFiat connection\nFollowing the merger with Fiat in late 2010, it took on a new and unrevealed identity that would have more likely shared Fiat's 199 platform with the Alfa Romeo MiTo. Designed to compete against the Mini (BMW), the new Hornet was expected to be released somewhere between 2011 and 2013. In May 2011, Chrysler had stated that a  capable subcompact vehicle with a new model name would be released in late 2011, as the first of the 2012 model year lineup.\n\nKnown inside the company as the \"PF,\" test vehicles purported to be the 2013 Dodge Hornet featuring a hatchback design were extensively photographed during 2011. The new compact was to \"be called the Dodge Hornet, in homage not only to the well-received 2006 concept car that carried the name but also to an ancestry of vehicles stretching back 60 years to the original Hudson Hornet.\" Although almost universally called Dodge Hornet by the automotive media, other potential names included continuing the Caliber and even resurrecting Neon for the new car to compete against the Ford Focus and Chevrolet Cruze.\n\nFurther test vehicles were a traditional four-door sedan body style based on the Alfa Romeo Giulietta, an altogether different platform from the 2006 mini MPV Dodge Hornet concept vehicle. Late in 2011, the automaker surprised industry pundits and insiders with an announcement that its new small sedan, which was to be revealed fully at the North American International Auto Show in January 2012, would be called the Dart.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n\nHornet"}

{"id": "4108070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham%20Theatre", "title": "Chatham Theatre", "text": "The Chatham Theatre or Chatham Street Theatre was a playhouse on the southeast side of Chatham Street (now Park Row) in New York City. It was located at numbers 143-9, between Roosevelt and James streets, a few blocks south of the Bowery. At its opening in 1839, the Chatham was a neighborhood establishment, which featured big-name actors and drama. By the mid-1840s, it had become primarily a venue for blackface minstrel shows. Frank S. Chanfrau restored some of its grandeur in 1848.\n\nThe playhouse's most successful period was under the management of A. H. Purdy. He staged productions of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin beginning in 1852, the success of which prompted him to advertise heavily and to create a special section where  African American patrons could sit. Following Purdy's departure in 1857, the theatre entered its final decline. It flip-flopped many times between a standard melodrama house and a concert saloon before finally being demolished in 1862.\n\nEarly management\n\nThomas Flynn and Henry Willard financed the construction of the Chatham Theatre in 1839. Under Flynn's management, the playhouse opened on 11 September 1839 with a production of A New Way to Pay Old Debts starring John R. Scott and Mrs. Thomas Flynn. It was essentially a neighborhood theatre at this time, and the effects of the Panic of 1837 were still being felt, so the establishment lost money. Nevertheless, Flynn and Willard kept it open for another year, staging comedies and dramas that starred popular actors, including James Anderson, William Rufus Blake, Junius Brutus Booth, and Mademoiselle Celeste. The theatre finally closed in January 1840 due to differences between the two owners.\nCharles R. Thorne bought Willard's stake and joined Flynn as manager for two weeks in February 1840. Still, the theatre saw little success. Thorne then bought out Flynn's stake for $500. As sole manager, Flynn led the playhouse to a profitable four years, featuring popular talents such as James S. Browne, Mary Ann Duff, Edwin Forrest, Thomas D. Rice, John Sefton, Henry Wallack, and Bill Williams.\n\nIn 1844, Thorne sold the theatre to his stage manager, a Mr. Stevens, and to A. W. Jackson, who managed for one season. During this time, the theatre was mainly a blackface minstrel house. On 8 April 1845, Ben De Bar became stage manager, but he soon partnered with William S. Deverna to lease the building. De Bar ceased active management on 5 October. M. S. Phillips was the next lessee, followed by J. Fletcher, who bought the theatre in 1847.\n\nBy this time, the Chatham Theatre was performing poorly. It became a circus for a time before eventually reopening as a playhouse. Admissions were low for the time: 25¢ for the boxes, one shilling for the pit, and six pence for the gallery. The audience now consisted of the lower classes, who on holidays \"used to talk, shout, and scream so that the actors went through their parts in dumb show . . . .\"\n\nFrank S. Chanfrau and W. Olgivie Ewen became joint lessees on 28 February 1848 with Chanfrau as manager. They renamed the building Chanfrau's National Theatre and tried to reclaim some of the theatre's lost prestige. This lasted until 8 July 1850.\n\nPurdy's tenure\n\nA. H. Purdy took over operations in 1850 for what would prove the theatre's most successful period. He renamed the building Purdy's National Theatre. He renovated in April 1852, reopening on 19 April. On 23 August 1852, Purdy produced the first non-comedic stage adaptation of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin in the United States. This version, written by Charles Western Taylor, ran for 11 nights but saw little success.\n\nMost of the 1853 season was devoted to a much more successful dramatization of Stowe's novel. The production ran almost non-stop from 18 July 1853 to 19 April 1854, when performances were cut back to three nights weekly until 13 May. The play proved so popular with African American audiences that Purdy created a special black-only section of the theatre on 15 August. No unaccompanied women were allowed there, and the entrance was separate from the main doors. Purdy expanded the section on 29 October. Despite the great success of the Uncle Tom's Cabin production, Purdy still lost money from advertising too heavily and by splurging on too many gifts for Cordelia Howard, the young actress who was starring in the drama.\n\nDespite this one overzealous blunder, Purdy had a flair for advertising. On 1 September 1856, he began his sixth season at the Chatham by erecting a statue of George Washington atop the playhouse while the New York Brass Band played and fireworks were launched. Purdy left during the Panic of 1857.\n\nLater management\n\nThe theatre then entered a long period of decline. The new owners redecorated before the 1858-9 season. Early on 10 July 1859, part of the theatre caught fire, apparently from gunfire special effects from the play the night before; the building suffered $500 in damages. The building was remodeled once again in November 1859 and reopened on 14 November as the Chatham Amphitheatre. Circuses provided the main attraction.\n\nOn 6 March 1860, J. Howard Rogers and Joseph C. Foster leased the building. They opened on 8 March as the National Concert Saloon. The emphasis now was on alcoholic beverages served by attractive waitresses. Admission prices were 12¢ for boxes and 6¢ for the pit. On 3 July, Charles J. Waters took over management and reopened as the National Theatre, a standard melodrama playhouse. George Beane replaced Waters on 6 October and restored the concert saloon theme. This lasted until December, when he gave it over to a German troupe.\n\nFox and Curran took over in 1861. They spent a great deal of money to restore the theatre, then reopened on 16 November as the National Music Hall. They failed to turn a profit, and George Lea, manager of the Melodeon on Broadway and Hooley's Theatre in Brooklyn gained control in December. He made the most of his three establishments by using the same actors at all three venues. They would first perform at the Melodeon, then travel to the Chatham, to finish up the night at Hooley's.\n\nIn October 1862, the Chatham Theater was demolished. Part of it survived and was rented to shopkeepers.\n\nNotes\n Brown, T. Allston (1903). A History of the New York Stage: From the First Performance in 1732 to 1901, Vol. 1.

The Daughters operate Pauline Books and Media Centres across the world. In addition, they also run Media Education Centres, Radio and Internet Channels (YouTube), and related institutions across the globe.\n\nHistory\nThe Congregation of the Daughters of St. Paul was founded on 15 June 1915 in Alba, Italy. Mother Thecla Merlo (born Maria Teresa Merlo) assisted in the founding and development of the Daughters of St. Paul and other Pauline institutes that developed throughout the 20th century. \n\nOn June 15, 1915, James Alberione established the women's workshop from which the Daughters of St. Paul developed began: the women religious were to teach women workskills, train catechists and run stores selling books and religious articles. Alberione entrusted the leadership of the group to Teresa Merlo (1894-1964), in religion Sister Thecla. In 1918, at the invitation of the local bishop, the Paulines opened their first branch in Susa, where they took over the editorship of the diocesan weekly la Valsusa.\n\nThe institute's first nine women religious made their perpetual profession of vows on July 22, 1922. The Pious Society Daughters of St. Paul was erected into a congregation of diocesan right by Joseph Francis Re, bishop of Alba, on March 15, 1929; it received the pontifical decree of praise on Dec. 13, 1943, and its constitutions were finally approved by the Holy See on March 15, 1953. The general headquarters is in Rome.\n\nApostolate\nThe Daughters of St. Paul are dedicated to the apostolate of printing: they own the publishing house Edizioni Paoline and operate bookstores, distribution agencies, printing houses, bindery and multimedia centers present all over the world.\n\nLocations\nThey are present in Europe (Czechia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, United Kingdom, Romania, Russia, Spain, Switzerland), in the Americas (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, United States of America, Uruguay, Venezuela), in Africa (Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia), in Asia (South Korea, Philippines, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Macau, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand) and in Oceania (Australia, Papua New Guinea)[4].\n\nPakistan\nThe congregation came to Pakistan at the invitation of Bishop Francis Cialeo of Faisalabad in 1958.\n\nIn 2009 there were 12 nuns, five of whom are local women, 8 novices and 20 aspirants. Sister Daniela Baronchelli who has worked in Pakistan for 22 years founded the first local community of the Daughters of St Paul in Karachi.\n\nIn every mission they put evangelization first, followed by programmes of spiritual and material assistance to the poor with a series of initiatives: social centres, medical care, education. They give special attention to children and young people. In Pakistan they have a primary and a secondary school and various other activities.\n\nKarachi\nThe inauguration of a book shop in Karachi in 1966 by Archbishop Joseph Cordeiro was the first in a Muslim country. It is located on Syedna Burhanuddin Road (formerly Mansfield Road). The sisters served the community by offering prayer books, bibles and religious articles. This book centre was reconsecrated by Archbishop Evarist Pinto on 30 June 2005.\n\nThe police raided the Sisters' bookshop in Karachi in June 2005, for allegedly issuing literature or materials which hurt the feelings or beliefs of other religions. The Daughters of St. Paul have been selling CDs, videos and Christian literature and material about the Christian religion and moral teachings in Karachi since 1948.\n\nIn 2015, the bookshop celebrated the 50th year in the city.\n\nLahore\nIn January 1968, Sr. Ignatia Balla, the superior general in Rome visited Pakistan to determine the need for the opening of a second community in Lahore upon the request of the Bishops from the Punjab. On 27 July 1968, four sisters started work in Lahore. Four religious books for adults and four books for children were published in Urdu. The Sisters also welcomed the first Pakistani vocations.\nThe sisters are involved in the wider area of communications. Sister Magdaline Ishaq chaired a World Communications Day seminar at her convent in Lahore on 27 April 2008. The nuns run three communications centers in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. The Daughters of St. Paul also conducted one-hour lectures on communication and its effects in a number of Catholic schools.\nThe sisters also have a bookshop on the premises of the Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore. The cathedral was one of several buildings damaged or destroyed by a bomb blast in Lahore in May 2009.\n\nThe shops of the Sisters in the main cities also act as the main channel of distribution for the products of WAVE Studio.\n\nIn 2016, Sister Athens Angeles of the Daughters of St. Paul held a lesson for their sisters, encouraging them to use social networks with a missionary purpose. According to Angeles this opens up \"the possibility of new vocations, better understanding of the mission at a local level, elevation of the dignity of women, opportunities for dialogue with the modern world and greater support to pastoral work\".\n\nOn 16 November 2019, the sisters used the launch of the Year of Youth 2020 at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore to unveil the Urdu translation of Christus vivit, the message of Pope Francis written in response to the 2018 synod.\n\nIslamabad-Rawalpindi\nIn 2006, two Sisters from Karachi started a new home in the diocese of Islamabad-Rawalpindi, where a book shop had already been built in front of the Bishop's House.\nIn January 2012 a youth group from the Cathedral Parish launched a new website for realising the potential of youth and expressing their concerns in a Christian way. It is hoped that the website will also help counter fundamentalism and fanaticism.\n\nMultan\nIn 2017 Bishop Benny Mario Travas inaugurated the book shop of the Daughters of St. Paul in the Multan Diocese.\n\nSee also\nPauline Family\nSociety of Saint Paul\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDaughters of St. Paul\nPauline Books & Media, apostolate of the Daughters of St. Paul\nMother Thecla Merlo\nBlessed James Alberione, founder\n3 minute trailer for documentary on life of Blessed James Alberione\n\nChristian organizations established in 1915\nPauline Family\nCatholic female orders and societies"}

George Rolleston and Anne Nettleship. His brother was the physician and zoologist George Rolleston.  He attended Rossall School and Emmanuel College, where he graduated in 1855 with second class honours in the classical tripos. He had intended to move to Canterbury but his father advised against it so he took up tutoring. However, this was merely a means of raising enough money to leave England in order to reject 'Conservatives and Ecclesiastics'.\n\nPolitical career\n\nRolleston first joined the Canterbury Provincial Council when he was appointed to the Canterbury Executive Council on 4 December 1863. His tenure on the Executive Council finished on 16 June 1865. On 23 January 1864, he was elected as a provincial councillor in the Heathcote electorate and remained a councillor until 23 June 1865. On 22 May 1868, he was elected unopposed as the 4th (and last) Superintendent of the Canterbury Province. He held that office until the abolition of the provinces on 31 October 1876.\n\nRolleston represented the Avon electorate from a by-election in 1868 to 1884. In 1878 as an MP Rolleston proposed a school for deaf children. The government agreed to open a state school for the deaf in Christchurch, and the Sumner Deaf and Dumb Institution opened in 1880.\n\nIn the 1879 general election, he was returned unopposed. He then represented Geraldine from 1884 to 1887. The Geraldine electorate was abolished in 1887 and replaced with the , where he was defeated by Searby Buxton. He then represented Halswell from 1890 to 1893. The Halswell electorate was abolished in 1893, and he contested Ellesmere, where he was defeated. He then represented Riccarton from 1896 to 1899. He had won the 1896 election against George Warren Russell, but was defeated by him in 1899 by just one vote.\n\nRolleston served as Minister of Justice in the government of Premier John Hall from December 1880 to April 1881. He was also appointed Minister of Native Affairs in January 1881 after the resignation of John Bryce, heading the department as the Government prepared to invade the Māori settlement of Parihaka in November. Rolleston stood aside as minister on the night of 19 October 1881 after the Hall government's Executive Council held an emergency meeting in the absence of Governor Sir Arthur Gordon to issue a proclamation against Māori prophet Te Whiti and the inhabitants of Parihaka, ordering them to leave Parihaka and accept the sale and dismemberment of their land or face \"the great evil which must fall on them\". He was replaced as minister by his predecessor, John Bryce, who three weeks later led a raid by 1600 Armed Constabulary on the settlement, the centre of a passive resistance campaign against the sale of Māori land.\n\nIn 1891 he was elected unopposed as Leader of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1893 he supported women's suffrage, and subsequently claimed the credit in the .\n\nLater life and commemoration\nHe married Elizabeth Mary Brittan in 1865 at Avonside, Christchurch; she was the daughter of Joseph Brittan. They had four daughters and five sons, including John, Frank and Arthur Rolleston. William Rolleston died at his Rangitata farm at Kapunatiki on 8 February 1903. He is buried at Holy Trinity Avonside. A statue was erected in his honour in front of the Canterbury Museum.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n  Gardner, W. J.

She is best known for playing Louise Summers in the British soap opera Hollyoaks (2005–2008), Lou Foster in the British drama series Lip Service (2010), Doreah in the American fantasy drama series Game of Thrones (2011–2012) and Lady Claire Riesen in the American apocalyptic supernatural series Dominion (2014–2015). She has also starred in films including Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines (2012), Vendetta (2013) and The Legend of Hercules (2014).\n\nEarly life and education\nMcKee was born in Canada to Irish parents and completed a BA degree in Social Policy & Political Studies at Royal Holloway, University of London in 2005.\n\nCareer\n\nHollyoaks\nMcKee auditioned for the role of Hollyoaks character Louise Summers in 2004 as part of Hollyoaks: On the Pull, a nationwide search to find a new actor. After being chosen from over 35,000 applicants, McKee began portraying Louise, who was introduced by series producer David Hanson in 2005.\n\nIn 2008, McKee hinted at a possible exit for her character, despite refusing claims that she wanted to leave. She told Look magazine: \"I'm not going to be there forever. I don't mind the long hours but I'll have been doing that for four years in October when my contract ends.\" After her contract ended in October 2008, McKee decided to leave the show in order to focus on other projects, mainly theatre. Several months after her final on-screen appearance, tabloid newspapers began to speculate that McKee would reprise the role to coincide with the exit of Jamie Lomas's character, Warren. McKee had previously told Digital Spy: \"Well, Louise might not be dead! That's the exciting twist in the future....On screen, you'll feel like she's dead but depending on me and whether I want to come back for an episode in March — I might be back. I filmed an extra scene showing that I'm still alive. There are flashbacks which show me being killed, but then there's a flashback which viewers won't see for a while, that will be used if I choose to come back for the episode. I kind of want to come back and finish off Louise's storyline, but at the moment, I might be doing something else. It would be really good, though — I'd be going back to kill a few people off.\"\n\nFollowing McKee's decision to leave the show, she said: \"I have enjoyed my time at Hollyoaks immensely and I'm going to really miss everyone at Lime Pictures. I have learned so much and will take away with me many happy memories — not just from everyone I have worked with but from Liverpool as a city too, which has become my second home. I know I will shed a few tears on the day I leave but I am so excited about what the future holds.\" Hollyoaks series producer Bryan Kirkwood commented on her departure, stating: \"As well as being the nation's sexiest soap star for two years running, Roxanne has worked incredibly hard to prove herself as a talented actress. She has been at the centre of one of our biggest storylines for the past two years and her exit scenes will be a fitting climax. Roxanne is a real star in the making and I'm sure this won't be the last that we hear of her.\" McKee won the award 'Sexiest Female' at The British Soap Awards in 2007 and 2008, an award she had been nominated for in 2006 and 2009. McKee was also won 'Sexiest Female' at the Inside Soap Awards in 2007 and 2008. In 2008 she was also nominated for 'Best Actress'.\n\nVirgin Media profiled some of Hollyoaks \"hottest females\" in their opinion, of Louise they stated: \"It's no surprise that sultry Roxanne McKee was voted sexiest soap star for two years running at the British Soap Awards. She's so foxy that even on-screen fiancé Warren was sad he had to finish her off.\"\n\nSubsequent roles\nIn 2008, McKee appeared in the Taio Cruz music video for \"She's like a Star\". The following year, McKee filmed parts in Johannes Roberts' hooligan horror film F and BBC Two's The Persuasionists.\n\nIn July 2009, McKee became the face of Clothes Show Live, stating: \"I've always watched it on TV and wanted to go, so I'm very flattered to be part of such a huge event\". In 2010, she was cast in a small role in on-line drama EastEnders: E20, playing bisexual character Pippa.\n\nMcKee acted in the modern lesbian drama Lip Service for BBC Three set in Glasgow, McKee would later play the part of a new character, Doreah in Game of Thrones, an HBO series based on the best-selling epic fantasy series of novels written by George RR Martin.\n\nIn May 2012, McKee was announced as being part of the horror sequel Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines.\n\nPersonal life\n\nAs of 2017, McKee lives in Los Angeles.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nAwards and nominations\n2006\n No. 91 in the FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World.\n\n2007\n Won at British Soap Awards in category of Sexiest Female for her role in Hollyoaks.\n Won at Inside Soap Award in category of Sexiest Female for her role in Hollyoaks.\n No. 42 in the FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World.\n\n2008\n Won at Digital Spy Soap Awards in category of Sexiest Female for her role in Hollyoaks.\n No. 97 in the FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World.\n Won at British Soap Awards in category of Sexiest Female for her role in Hollyoaks.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Profile, whatsontv.co.uk\n\nLiving people\nActors from Lewisham\nActresses from London\nAlumni of Royal Holloway, University of London\nBritish television actresses\nBritish soap opera actresses\nCanadian television actresses\nPeople educated at Our Lady of Sion School\n21st-century English actresses\nEnglish soap opera actresses\n1980 births\nCanadian people of Irish descent\nBritish people of Irish descent"}

He also played at the famous 2i's Coffee Bar in Old Compton Street and was offered a residency which he turned down due to his reluctance to sign any contracts with owner Tom Littlewood. After a later spell in northern England playing with a Bury-based group, he returned to London and joined a \"mod\" band called the Favourite Sons who recorded some tracks in 1965 with Mike Hurst and also played on the album they made. It was this band that occasionally backed Vince Eager and Tommy Quickly.\n\nIn 1966, he joined the Freddie Mack Sound which consisted of anything between ten and eighteen personnel with a full scale horn section led by baritone sax player Roger Warwick and toured Britain, Ireland and France incessantly. It was here that he met drummer B. J. Wilson and bassist Alan Cartwright, both of whom were later to join Procol Harum. The band also included Liverpudlian singer Derry Wilkie who had previously topped the bill over The Beatles in Germany with his band the Pressmen. The Freddie Mack Sound was so popular on the road that people would be turned away at some gigs. This was certainly the case when the band appeared at Liverpool's Cavern Club. Freddie Mack was a former American light-heavyweight boxer of some repute. The connection helped to get them a regular residency at English boxer Billy Walker's Uppercut Club in Forest Gate, east London. They played with all the leading acts of the time such was The Who, Pink Floyd, The Small Faces and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nFollowing a myriad of aforementioned backing work, Peck was then invited by Alan Cartwright to join Every Which Way, a short-lived band prior to Cartwright and B. J. Wilson joining Procol Harum. He had a knack for turning down such promising offers having previously refused to join the chart-topping Foundations. He was also known for walking out of engagements he did not like, and was either lauded or criticised by contemporaries for his very fast playing style.\n\nDuring his time backing The Flower Pot Men around Europe, who also played at Wembley's Empire Pool with Cliff Richard and The Shadows, two members of the backing band – bassist Nick Simper and organist Jon Lord – were approached by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore to form what later became Deep Purple. Peck and Blackmore had previously met in Hamburg through their drummer Carlo Little, although there was no animosity about the band's break up. They continued to exchange guitars and amplifiers for subsequent recording sessions. Simper was then temporarily replaced by former Georgie Fame bassist Tex Makins who toured Switzerland with Peck and Little backing singer David Garrick. Before this, Peck, Lord, Simper and Little had taken part in a 'package tour' with the U.S. band Vanilla Fudge, and Steve Winwood. Incessant touring around Europe taking in Germany many times, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium continued to take their toll.\n\nIn 1968, Peck worked with Billy Fury, whilst trying to form a trio called Storm with former Screaming Lord Sutch bass player Tony Dangerfield and drummer Pete Phillipps. They recorded a solo album although the tapes were subsequently lost. BBC recordings done with Fury from that year have turned up on Fury's official website. On one tour, the group played solo in German, France, and then Germany again (all in the same day), but failed to take off in England. For Peck, session work continued with the likes of pianist Nicky Hopkins who played on many of The Rolling Stones records and James Royal.\n\nFollowing this, he was asked to join a project band by Nick Simper who had subsequently left Deep Purple. Peck joined forces with keyboard player Rick Wakeman in writing some of the material. However, Wakeman suddenly left and his place was taken by Frank Wilson. Ashley Holt was brought in as a singer whilst Peck and Simper discovered Birmingham drummer Mac Poole. Holt and Wakeman had previously been watched when playing at the Top Rank Ballroom in Reading.\n\nIn the meantime, Peck was earning a living from session work and touring with Marsha Hunt, work that culminated in an appearance at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival in front of 150,000 alongside The Who, Bob Dylan, Joe Cocker and Richie Havens amongst others. Typically, he insisted on using his simple 30 watt Vox amplifier miked-up through Pete Townshend's rather more extensive gear. (This can be seen on a photograph of Peck on stage with Marsha Hunt on an Isle of Wight Festival website). Thereafter, Poole replaced Pete Phillipps on drums and the trio secretly rehearsed with Wilson and Holt for what was to become Warhorse.\n\nFormed between 1969 and 1970, Warhorse released their first LP of the same name which did moderately well, although by this time, Peck was becoming disillusioned with the limitations of rock music and the constant travelling. After some fractious confrontations with the others, he departed. There was one final attempt at a new band with rehearsals at drummer Mitch Mitchell's house following the death of Hendrix, but nothing came of it and he soon left the rock business and became a classical guitarist. In his later years, he took a university degree to become a college lecturer specialising in English and Russian history.\n\nPeck died in January 2015, aged 67.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nPhotos of Peck, Carlo Little, Nick Simper, and Bille Davis in Germany in 1967\nPhotos on Carlo Little's website\nLink written by Giselle Rawlins with photo of live TV show - Peck on the left, Little doing a drum solo, Simper facing the camera, and Lord far right\nList of musicians who played with Tex Makins\nList of musicians who played with Tony Dangerfield\nList of musicians who played with Mac Poole\nThe interconnections of various musicians taken from the Deep Purple Family Tree website\nInterview given in 2002\n\n1947 births\n2015 deaths\nEnglish rock guitarists\nEnglish session musicians\nPeople from the London Borough of Barnet\nScreaming Lord Sutch and the Savages members\nWarhorse (British band) members\nThe Flower Pot Men members"}
